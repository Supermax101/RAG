## LEARNING OBJECTIVES

*   Evaluate parenteral nutrition orders for the appropriate content and use of macronutrients based on estimated requirements.
*   Design a parenteral nutrition formulation that limits dextrose provision while balancing overall nutrient requirements.
*   Compare minimum requirements of available lipid emulsion formulations to prevent essential fatty acid deficiency.
*   Calculate a patient's estimated fluid requirements using the three most common methods.
*   Evaluate the clinical need to modify fluid provision compared to calculated maintenance fluid requirements.

DETERMINING DOSING WEIGHT

*   Dosing weight shall be determined for each patient
    *   Determine an ideal body weight (IBW):
        *   Women IBW = 45.5 kg + (2.3 kg × each inch over 60 inches)
        *   Men IBW = 50 kg + (2.3 kg × each inch over 60 inches)
            *   Not applicable if under 60 inches
    *   Use actual body weight if below IBW
    *   Methods for adjusting body weight of obese patients have been suggested, but none have been clearly validated & may lead to overfeeding
        *   IBW is preferred to adjusted body weight (AdjBW) in patients weighing more than 130% of their IBW:
            AdjBW = IBW + [(Actual Wt (kg) – IBW) × 0.25]

## DETERMINING CARBOHYDRATE NEEDS

*   Typical adult carbohydrate intake is approximately 50% of total calories
    *   Minimum: 50 g/day to avoid ketone production
*   Carbohydrate in PN provided as dextrose (most common) or glycerol
    *   1 g of dextrose monohydrate provides 3.4 kcal
        *   Hyperglycemia more common in hospitalized patients with > 4 mg/kg/minute of dextrose
            *   Approximately 2 g/kg/day is considered protein-sparing
            *   D5W at 125 mL/hr provides 150 g/day of dextrose
        *   Maximum: 7 g/kg/day
    *   1 g of glycerol provides 4.3 kcal

*   Essential fatty acids required: LA and ALA
    *   Minimum amounts of total calories:
        *   At least 1-4% from LA
        *   AND
        *   0.25-0.5% from ALA
    *   Minimum to prevent EFAD with PN \u2013 soybean oil contains 54% LA & 7% ALA

# CONCLUSIONS

*   Primary goal of nutrition support is to provide the required amounts of nitrogen (protein) and energy together with water, minerals, vitamins and trace elements
    *   Dependent on patient age, presence of malnutrition and underlying comorbidities
*   Protein dosing is dependent upon nitrogen losses and physiologic status
    *   Providing adequate non-protein calories to have a protein-sparing effect
*   Combinations of carbohydrate (e.g., dextrose) and fat (e.g., ILE) with protein are required for meeting energy requirements
*   Fluid needs are dictated by maintenance requirements in addition to ongoing losses (e.g., diarrhea)
