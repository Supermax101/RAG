# Introduction

Health status and a fundamental nutrition base start at the level of conception, with the support of a healthy and nourished fetus throughout gestation and continue throughout the lifespan. Nutrition support practice should include use of evidence-based practices, acknowledged growth/nutrient guidelines, monitoring for malnutrition, and the use of outcomes from timely research and references. Synthesis of this information should guide any required treatment and nutrition interventions for clinical professionals. Key communication within the interdisciplinary team and family will create continuity of care following the nutrition support journey from infancy to adolescence.¹

### Determining Nutrient Needs
Determining nutrient and fluid needs is a critical step in developing an enteral nutrition (EN) plan, as energy and protein needs change with age and vary by sex (see Tables 4-1 and 4-2).

**Energy Needs**

Indirect calorimetry (IC) is the gold standard for estimating resting
energy expenditure (REE).2 It measures oxygen consumption and carbon
dioxide production to determine REE. Given equipment needs and
patient requirements, IC is not always clinically feasible. IC devices may
include devices that can be used with patients who are mechanically
ventilated or smaller devices that are use a hood canopy, mouthpiece, or

<a id='3fb6d33d-8c9d-454c-a30e-7f54ecb1bac8'></a>

handheld unit.² See chapter 11, "Critical Care," for further discussion of IC.

<a id='a3dff3f4-578b-4326-802a-81ab64d0f3f3'></a>

To estimate energy needs for children without IC available, calculate basal metabolic rate (BMR), assess growth goals, and consider increased needs related to illness. Predictive equations can be helpful in determining BMR using the Schofield equation (Table 4-3) and REE using the World Health Organization (WHO) equation (Table 4-4).¹ Infants and children who are below their expected growth patterns may require higher energy provision to allow for catch-up growth. Not attaining catch-up growth may lead to additional medical issues, permanent stunting, and cognitive delays.¹,² For hospitalized children whose energy needs may be altered with metabolic stress, the following stress factors may be used to better estimate energy needs:

<a id='aa87fa7c-fe08-461e-a56c-6420fec52e02'></a>

## Fluids
Adequate hydration is essential for maintenance of health. The Holiday-Segar method allows for calculation of baseline fluid needs (Table 4-5). Baseline hydration status and the presence of dehydration or fluid overload should be assessed and used to guide the nutrition care plan (see chapter 1, "Nutrition Screening and History,” Table 1-14). Children with acute and chronic illness may have special nutrition and fluid considerations. See disease-specific chapters for more information.

# Acid-Base Status
Acid-base balance is maintained by the lungs, kidneys, and endogenous buffers. Acid-base disorders include acidosis and alkalosis of either

<a id='dc6a8a1e-48e2-4ff9-bb4a-bbc00fc1b993'></a>

metabolic or respiratory origin. Many of these imbalances may be
attributed to chronic health issues, organ issues, medications, parenteral
nutrition (PN), diarrhea, and other electrolyte/metabolic changes. Careful
attention to fluid losses is important when developing a nutrition care
plan. See chapter 6, “Parenteral Nutrition,” Table 6-8 for the electrolyte
composition of different body fluids.2,5

# Vitamins and Minerals

Vitamins and minerals are essential for growth and development in infants and children. Ensuring adequacy is a key component of the nutrition care plan. Key terms to know when assessing the vitamin and nutrient needs of a patient include the following:

*   Estimated average requirements (EAR): The intake value that is estimated to meet the requirement defined by a specified indicator of adequacy in 50% of an age- and sex-specific group.²
*   Recommended dietary allowance (RDA): The intake level that is sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all healthy persons and includes a wide safety margin to prevent deficiency.²
*   Adequate intake (AI): The recommended daily average intake from observed estimates that is assumed to be adequate for the population. AI should be used as a goal for intake when no RDAs exist.²
*   Upper intake limit (UL): The maximum level of daily nutrient intake that is unlikely to pose risk of adverse health effects.²
*   Daily dietary reference intake (DRI): Intake amounts based on contemporary studies that not only address preventing nutrition deficiencies but also reducing the risk of chronic disease, promoting optimal health, and preventing toxicities.²

***Nutrition Diagnosis***

Ascertainment of information is critical to support an accurate and descriptive nutrition diagnosis. The interview/screen or gathering of information should include growth and anthropometric history, intake history, supplements, cultural needs, food barriers/challenges, economic concerns, family systems, food insecurity issues, home environment, avoidances/food beliefs, medical issues, medications, laboratory values,

<a id='d07f9fe6-ba4c-4e96-9fe5-b996a70567e2'></a>

gastrointestinal (GI) issues/concerns, physical activity/interests, sleep
patterns, signs and symptoms of malnutrition, and the nutrition-focused
physical examination. 1,2,6,7

<a id='97a9f282-40b4-4a6d-a055-6c619a993057'></a>

# Terminology

In the nutrition care plan, it is important to document the presence of malnutrition, chronicity, and etiology.⁸

* Acute malnutrition: Present <3 months
* Chronic malnutrition: Present >3 months
* Illness-related malnutrition: Occurs as the result of a disease process leading to increased nutrient losses such as with diarrhea or vomiting, altered nutrient use, and/or increased energy needs
* Non-illness-related malnutrition: Occurs as the result of environmental or behavioral factors that lead to decreased nutrient intake. Underlying causes of non-illness-related malnutrition include economic issues such as food insecurity, decreased nutrient provision or intake, and behavioral issues.

<a id='9168e3d1-399a-487e-b952-f60aa6b120ea'></a>

Chapter 1, “Nutrition Screening and History,” and chapter 2,
“Malnutrition,” further discuss malnutrition diagnostic criteria.

<a id='32e20670-98fe-487a-8218-206a18d9e405'></a>

# Billing and Coding

The nutrition diagnosis should reflect specific criteria to align with the billable diagnosis. 1,2,8,9 International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes were developed by WHO and were adapted by the US health care system for billing purposes. Codes vary greatly and the clinical nutrition professional should consult the hospital billing codes that reflect the criteria of the nutrition diagnosis. The following are examples of ICD, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification, codes:

* E44.1: Mild protein-calorie malnutrition
* E44.0: Moderate protein-calorie malnutrition
* E43: Severe protein-calorie malnutrition

**Nutrition Interventions**
Nutrition interventions should be patient- and disease-specific with a
nutrition care plan that addresses the specific issues identified by the

<a id='219b577d-34b8-40e1-950d-6fc1c76ff771'></a>

clinical nutrition professional and team. 1,2,6,9

<a id='6fb4777a-0673-4bbb-abab-535e608fc94b'></a>

# Nutrition Care Plan

The basic nutrition care plan for nutrition support should include the following:

* Route of administration
* Type of diet or formula
* Schedule of administration
* Starting rate, advancement plan, and target rate
* Monitoring frequency
* Details of nutrient goals (energy, protein, carbohydrates, fat, fluid, vitamin, and minerals as applicable)
* Weight gain and growth targets

Frequency of monitoring the nutrition care plan depends on the age and severity of malnutrition present and is outlined in Table 4-11. Infants have higher expected growth and weight gain velocity than older children and therefore require more frequent assessment of their growth. See chapter 1, “Nutrition Screening and History,” for expected rates of weight gain and linear growth.

**Route of Administration**

Whenever possible, the GI tract should be used. If a patient is able to take any or all oral feeds safely, this should be promoted. 1,2,9 If the oral route cannot be used, enteral feeding via tube may be used. An initial tube feeding plan should include starting and goal volumes, rate of administration, and feeding schedule. Patients should be monitored for

<a id='36e89763-aaa6-4aa7-a2ab-e2f85b06ddf7'></a>

tolerance, refeeding syndrome if applicable, changes in malnutrition
status, and medical stability.

<a id='a0d9b527-3f2a-48b3-95f6-db250a2aa17e'></a>

For cases in which oral and enteral tube feeding are not available or
tolerated, parenteral feeding can be used. With any form of nutrition
support, long-term goals may include returning to oral intakes as
medically appropriate, even if only to promote quality of life. 1,2,9

<a id='09c270cc-d0f1-49c5-9339-4b330719982f'></a>

# Feeding Advancement

Initiate feeds and advance to the anticipated goal taking into consideration medical status, tolerance, growth needs, physical activity, developmental status, and malnutrition status. Enteral feeding rate, concentration of formula, and schedule of feeds may be adjusted as feedings increase. When advancing oral feeds, it is important to consider the rapid development in feeding skills of infants and children as outlined in chapter 3, "Clinical Considerations," Table 3-1.

<a id='4bae6cff-cfe0-4029-89b4-527ac5c4e446'></a>

**Transitions**

Managing transitional feedings is the process of transitioning nutrition support from one modality to another or weaning a patient off nutrition support to oral eating and should be individualized with goals and timing reflective of patient's clinical status.⁵

<a id='7b3522a2-408d-45c9-9b99-74c1faa285bc'></a>

Parenteral Nutrition to Tube Feedings. When transitioning from PN to tube feeding, begin tapering PN when tube feedings are providing 33%-50% of patient's nutrient requirements. Progress with decreasing PN and increasing EN until tube feedings are tolerated and provide 60%-75% of nutrient requirements; PN can then be discontinued.⁵ It is important to continuously meet assessed nutrition needs for children who may be weaning slowly off PN to EN or may continue to require small amounts of supplemental PN long-term.

<a id='4bba8cee-a33b-4da5-8294-19dbfca60791'></a>

Tube Feeding to Oral Intake. As oral intake increases, supplement EN to meet needs at a reduced rate. Maintain placement of temporary access device until meeting nutrient requirements and showing consistent growth.5
Long-term enteral access devices may remain in place for several months to ensure the patient continues to meet weight gain and growth goals.
Ways to help increase oral intake include the following:

* Offer meals in an age-appropriate seat.
* Schedule meals and snacks to prevent grazing.
* Ensure that there are no distractions during mealtime.1,2,6,7
* Offer oral foods before tube feeds.
* Give tube feeds while offering oral foods.

<a id='b8854ddb-212b-42b9-9214-20255030a82c'></a>

# Communication With the Patient and Family

Communication is key to improved assessment, treatment, intervention, outcomes, and continuity of care. The clinical nutrition professional needs to communicate with both the patient and family as well as the patient care teams in medical and ancillary areas such as the kitchen, formula room, home care, or food service providers.

<a id='038f6e5e-102f-4f03-8411-af67dbc9fa9a'></a>

It is important to address barriers to communication, including the following:
* Cultural differences and beliefs
* Language
* Educational levels, including understanding of health and medical terms
* Cognitive issues, including past trauma, substance use, and neurological losses
* Religious beliefs
* Economic or family stressors
* Geography and location
* Grief
* Surrogate decision makers
* Shortages in staffing and/or supplies
* Insurance
* Any additional barriers to care. 1,2,9

<a id='57f36077-f0d4-4e21-829b-ae7f62623a9c'></a>

Taking time to address the individualized communication needs of patients and their families will aid in the monitoring process and the ability to offer targeted nutrition education and support when needed, improving outcomes and the continuum of care.

# Enteral Nutrition Access

Enteral nutrition (EN) support is a nutrition intervention that can provide full or partial nutrition support to patients with a functional gastrointestinal (GI) tract. To supply nutrition, an enteral access device (EAD) is required. Temporary EADs are intended to be used for 12 weeks or fewer. The feeding tube type should be selected for each individual patient considering the intended use of the tube, the diameter or French size, and the insertion length. Long-term EADs are placed when it is determined that nutrition support will be needed for more than 3 months.² Patients should meet one of the following criteria to proceed with the placement of a long-term EAD:

* Not safe or unable to feed by mouth
* Not able to eat enough by mouth
* Unable to consume special medical diet by mouth
* Adequate support for management of a short-term device not available
* Require gastric decompression²

Tables 5-1 through 5-5 further discuss EADs.

Enteral Nutrition Complications

<a id='c5918b1d-b0d1-4e0f-b81b-a19f1f0ce3fc'></a>

**Clogged Tubes**

Any feeding tube may become clogged; however, smaller-bore and longer EADs are most implicated. Feeding tubes may become clogged from inadequate tube flushing with medication administration or feedings. To prevent clogged tubes, use the following guidelines:

* Provide adequate flushing with sterile water before and after administering medications.
* Avoid providing crushed medications.
* Provide scheduled flushing of jejunal tubes.²

<a id='d08f0762-85dc-45ba-87b1-26a543330637'></a>

If a tube does become clogged, a pancreatic enzyme activated with a 650-mg tablet of sodium bicarbonate may be used to attempt to unclog the tube. Avoid cola soda and juice as they may lead to further worsening of the clog because of pH changes in the mixture.3

<a id='ed92ebec-d0f7-4590-966a-69ae755902e2'></a>

**Skin Complications**

Caring for the skin around an EAD is essential to maintaining skin integrity. Skin breakdown around a tube site may cause drainage and leaking from the tube site, which can further damage the skin and interrupt feedings. Proper hygiene and protecting the skin from moisture, friction, and trauma are the most important steps to prevent skin breakdown.² Patients requiring EN should have an interdisciplinary team to provide comprehensive care and treat complications.² Clinicians and families can find more resources on feeding tubes on the Feeding Tube Awareness Foundation website (https://www.feedingtubeawareness.org/).⁴

# Formula Selection

## Human Milk

Human milk is the optimal feeding choice for most infants. Mother's milk or donor human milk may be used in feeding infants.

<a id='0ff55a89-cbb0-4020-90ed-9c14cf19ba6b'></a>

**Human Milk Fortification**
Human milk can be fortified for both preterm and term infants. Liquid
human milk fortifiers, powdered infant formulas, concentrated infant
formulas or modulars may be used. See chapter 7, “Neonatal Nutrition,”
for more details.

<a id='b1973e62-09b3-4409-a799-4c3208351055'></a>

**Infant Formulas**

Infant formulas are regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with specifications regarding labeling, quality control, formula recalls, new product notifications, exempt products, and nutrient levels. Infant formulas are intended to meet the nutrition needs of healthy infants from birth to 1 year of age. Manufacturers are required to declare the levels of each nutrient and analyze each batch of formula to ensure those

<a id='60c8d180-38fe-4f2d-8caf-b3f62b2d90d6'></a>

levels are present in the product. There are established minimal levels for
29 nutrients and maximum levels for 9 nutrients.5

<a id='ecd66a45-aaa5-40b9-9728-65d1429458da'></a>

## Standard Infant Formulas

Standard infant formulas have the following characteristics (see Appendix 5-2):

* They are made from cow's milk and suitable for most term infants.
* Composition of macronutrients and micronutrients varies among manufacturers.
* Higher in protein and some essential nutrients than breast milk, in which these nutrients are more bioavailable.
* Varieties include organic formulas, formulas targeted for breast milk supplementation, and formulas with additional prebiotics or probiotics.

<a id='580fef1e-4924-42e6-9aff-77dff32ef66a'></a>

# Reduced-Lactose/Lactose-Free Formulas

Reduced-lactose and lactose-free formulas are similar to standard milk-based formulas in both macronutrient and micronutrient content, but polysaccharides are used instead of lactose for the carbohydrate source. This may be done in formulas with hydrolyzed protein to reduce the osmolality. Formulas with reduced-lactose and/or partially hydrolyzed protein are not appropriate for infants with cow's milk protein intolerance. Congenital lactase deficiency is extremely rare because most babies make adequate amounts of lactase. See Appendix 5-3.

<a id='d27d97e0-d998-4343-b941-be3e42bdd7cf'></a>

# Soy-Based Formulas

Soy-based formulas are fortified with iron and are lactose free. They contain higher calcium and phosphorous content than standard infant formulas because of decreased bioavailability. They may be used with galactosemia, hereditary lactase deficiency, or if a vegan human milk substitute is desired. See Appendix 5-4.

<a id='5de58674-d7be-40ce-9dd8-d26225ce51ed'></a>

**Extensively Hydrolyzed Protein Formulas**
Extensively hydrolyzed protein formulas are considered hypoallergenic
and can be used for infants with cow's milk or soy protein intolerance

<a id='290a20a1-0f3e-4625-a4ad-a687bf01f0e1'></a>

because of the protein content of free amino acids and small peptides.
These formulas have similar macronutrient distribution among them but
differ in sources of carbohydrates and fats. They may also be used for
infants with malabsorption. See Appendix 5-5.

<a id='5da21947-2ccd-44fb-876c-0593932176d8'></a>

## Amino Acid-Based Formulas

Amino acid-based formulas contain free amino acids as the protein source with varying carbohydrate and fat sources. They may be indicated in allergic infants and infants who do not respond to extensively hydrolyzed protein formulas, eosinophilic GI disorders, or short bowel syndrome. See Appendix 5-6.

<a id='e6f359a5-8764-44ea-9f7e-58db7ec02c8d'></a>

## Added Rice Starch Formulas

Formulas with added rice starch are designed to thicken in the acidic environment of the stomach to reduce episodes of spit up. The macronutrient distribution is similar to standard milk-based formulas. If rice or oat cereal is added to a standard formula in attempt to reduce spit up, the macronutrient distribution is disturbed, resulting in increased carbohydrate intake. See Appendix 5-7.

<a id='33e55fbc-61d3-4115-9ae8-2893fd6272ed'></a>

## Preterm Formulas

Preterm or low birth weight formulas as well as preterm discharge formulas are discussed in chapter 4, “Infant to Adolescent.”

<a id='1dd062d0-6bae-4303-a891-52303b190bf0'></a>

# Other Infant Formulas

Other types of infant formulas include the following (see Appendix 5-8):

* Carbohydrate free: Designed for infants with carbohydrate metabolism disorders or carbohydrate malabsorption and require the addition of a carbohydrate source for use.
* Modified fat: Used in conditions of fat malabsorption, lymphatic disorders, chylothorax, or long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency and require monitoring for essential fatty acid (EFA) deficiencies.
* Reduced mineral: Designed to mimic mineral content of human milk to support infants with calcium disorders or impaired renal function and require additional supplementation of iron if indicated.

<a id='435e5afb-2c50-42ab-ab93-63c5e8f306d4'></a>

## European Formulas
European formulas for infants have several differences compared with formulas produced in the United States and regulated by the FDA. First, the labels of European formula may not be in English. Mixing of European infant formulas can vary from formulas manufactured in the United States, including units of measurement, which presents a concern for appropriate mixing and safety. There are generally 2 stages of formulas for ages 0–6 months and 6–12 months. Both stages require docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)/arachidonic acid (ARA) to be added per the European formula guidelines. The iron content required in European formula is 0.2 mg per serving, compared with 1 mg per serving required in the United States by the FDA.5,6 Families should be cautious when purchasing European formula from third-party vendors because the consumer protections of the FDA are bypassed, which increases safety risks such as tampering, contamination, and suboptimal nutrient composition.7

<a id='4d0d34c9-f92b-4715-ac50-b18054841b6c'></a>

**_Concentration_**

Infants may require concentrated infant formula if their fluid volume is limited and/or energy needs are increased. Table 5-6 provides recipes for many powdered infant formulas. Formula concentrates may come in various volumes; the use of Table 5-7 is appropriate with 13-oz cans of formula concentrate. Recipes should always be verified before using in an institution or supplying to a patient.

**_Functional Ingredients_**

**Docosahexaenoic Acid/Arachidonic Acid**

DHA and ARA are long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids that are synthesized from the dietary EFAs \u03b1-linolenic acid and linoleic acid. DHA and ARA are present in human milk and added to infant formulas voluntarily in the United States.

<a id='90488b3b-c229-4012-a066-0cf57a77423b'></a>

## Prebiotics

Prebiotics are fermentable carbohydrates that are not fully digested in the small intestine and promote the growth of normal gut flora and limit

<a id='5026451f-d565-4cbb-be4d-0644bd7a2f3c'></a>

pathogenic bacteria. Fermentation produces short-chain fatty acids that can be used for energy by colonocytes. Short-chain galacto-oligosaccharides and long-chain fructo-oligosaccharides are studied the most and have demonstrated benefits of stool softening, reduced infections, and modulation of the immune system.

<a id='0a454fdc-1123-4fcb-b7a2-b4969a40916f'></a>

Human milk oligosaccharides are prebiotics that may be added to infant formulas.<sup>8</sup>

<a id='d8599f95-5199-4796-bc9f-be4ffcb6e6b2'></a>

# Probiotics

Probiotics consist of nonpathogenic bacteria that change microflora in the intestine and may promote the development of the infant's immune system and decrease inflammation.⁸

<a id='d9e7ab57-b453-400a-9b72-fe2cba5042b5'></a>

**Synbiotics**
Synbiotics are a combination of both probiotics and prebiotics. They may
be beneficial, but more studies are needed.8

<a id='fdba2802-333c-4d8b-827f-6d5bfe9c8231'></a>

# Postbiotics

Postbiotics consist of inactivated microbial cells with demonstrated health benefits. They are more stable than probiotics in industrial process and storage because they are not sensitive to heat or oxygen.

Formulas fermented with *Bifidobacterium breve* C50 and *Streptococcus thermophilus* are available in some parts of the world. There is no clear evidence of the benefit of one formula over another. The recommendation for health care providers is to determine whether the potential benefits outweigh costs.⁹

<a id='969074ec-cea4-45bb-a735-b3354d7c548e'></a>

## Human Milk Oligosaccharides
More than 100 human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) have been identified in human milk. They are the third most abundant solid component in human milk after lactose and lipids. A trisaccharide consisting of glucose, galactose, and fructose, 2'-fucosyllactose (2'-FL),

<a id='02e000c6-78a5-4c4a-8dc5-49b01cd588f9'></a>

is the most abundant HMO in most human milk analyzed. The HMO 2'-
FL is thought to act as a prebiotic with additional gut, immune, and
cognition benefits. A structurally identical 2'-FL has been synthesized
and added to infant formulas to support immune and gut health.<sup>10</sup>
Lacto-N-neotetraose is a tetra-saccharide also added to infant
formulas.<sup>8</sup>

<a id='dac05791-4d4c-49b9-bdb8-0c52d23cf543'></a>

**Pediatric Formulas**

Pediatric enteral product options continue to increase as alternative formulas for specific disease states, nutrient content, and consumer desire are created. Most standard pediatric enteral formulas that include vitamins and minerals meet the micronutrient needs of children ages 1–10 in 1000 mL/d. Adult formulas may be considered for children when deemed appropriate for disease state or nutrient needs.

<a id='d9860d5d-1844-4ed1-b3b8-a4d82e8687ed'></a>

# Oral Supplements
Oral supplements are intended to supplement insufficient oral diets and may not be appropriate for sole-source nutrition intakes. They are available in standard pediatric, adult, semi-elemental, and elemental varieties.

<a id='916ca6a5-536f-44ac-bf36-f962d5b84e6e'></a>

**Pediatric Elemental Enteral Formulas**
Pediatric elemental enteral formulas are the sole-source nutrition indicated for malabsorption or multiple food allergies. They are a protein source of 100% free amino acids and the macronutrient content varies among formulas within the category. See Appendix 5-9.

<a id='83fbd2ff-4e68-4bc9-9246-24872527b8d6'></a>

**Pediatric Semi-Elemental/Hydrolysate Enteral Formulas**
Pediatric semi-elemental/hydrolysate enteral formulas are the sole-source
nutrition designed for malabsorption or intolerance to polymeric formula.
See Appendix 5-10.
* Protein content of peptides derived from hydrolyzed whey or soy protein

<a id='6bde4d25-f4e2-486e-9465-c35a52bd5bd4'></a>

- Higher amount of fat from medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) than polymeric formula
- Available in 1 kcal/mL and 1.5 kcal/mL

<a id='6630ea7e-8e92-45ae-bfdc-df56f79e8bc9'></a>

**Pediatric Polymeric Complete Enteral Formulas**

Pediatric polymeric complete enteral formulas are sole-source nutrition indicated for tube feeding for children with normal GI function. See Appendix 5-11.

* May be flavored or unflavored
* Milk-based, lactose-free, soy, and pea protein option
* Available with and without fiber
* Caloric densities: 0.67 kcal/mL, 1 kcal/mL, 1.5 kcal/mL

<a id='e7aa10ec-c2bf-4e8e-bf8e-2c66cc3ebab6'></a>

# Pediatric Whole Food–Based Enteral Formulas

Some pediatric whole food–based enteral formula varieties are tailored to sole-source nutrition, whereas others are only supplemental and require micronutrient analysis and supplementation. See Appendix 5-12.

* The protein source may be plant or meat based.
* They differ in caloric densities: 1.1 to 1.4 kcal/mL
* They may need to be diluted to be thin enough to be safely and effectively administered.

<a id='b834cf12-ec8d-43c9-a455-14b0baafb54e'></a>

# Other Specialized Pediatric Enteral Formulas

For other specialized pediatric enteral formulas, consider the following:

* Ketogenic: Ratios of 3:1 and 4:1 available in standard protein or semi-elemental varieties (see chapter 23, "Seizures," for more information)
* Altered fat content: Increased MCTs and low long-chain triglycerides (LCTs)
* Renal disease: Liquid and powdered formulas available (see chapter 19, "Renal Disease")
* Metabolic diseases: Modified amino acid content, altered fat content, and protein-free formulas (see chapter 17, "Inborn Errors of Metabolism," for more details)

<a id='544250d5-9bb5-4040-9ba5-bd8e25f017bc'></a>

## Adult Formula
Adult formulas may be indicated for use in pediatric patients with increased protein needs because of the higher protein content than most pediatric formulas. Additionally, adult formulas may be used in pediatric patients with certain disease states because of differing macronutrient or

<a id='e11a1ecd-618c-4158-820a-05d3b84cdd36'></a>

micronutrient content. When adult formulas are used in pediatric patients,
total micronutrient intakes should be evaluated. See chapter 4, "Infant to
Adolescent," for dietary reference intakes. Adult formulas, like pediatric
formulas, are available in the categories of polymeric, semi-elemental,
elemental, and specialized formulas. See Appendixes 5-13 through 5-16.

<a id='41e015b7-d597-432d-8f56-0993d3b8ef12'></a>

# Modular Macronutrients

Modulars can be used to increase the calorie, protein, and/or fat content of formula.

* Protein:
  * Liquid or powder
  * Intact or extensively hydrolyzed
  * Pureed baby food meats
  * May alter osmolarity of formula significantly
* Carbohydrate:
  * Liquid or powder
  * Table sugar, juice, corn starch
  * May significantly alter osmolarity of formula
* Fat:
  * MCTs or LCTs

<a id='6ff16193-3970-4f96-a123-13291b284661'></a>

Combination products with varying contents of carbohydrate, protein, or fat available

<a id='1da35abe-3f53-4b8a-969b-e0d14d550092'></a>

# Formula Safety

Enteral formulas are shelf stable. Once the container is opened, it can be covered and stored for 24 hours in the refrigerator. Formula mixed from powder can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours.

<a id='5d70090a-ed15-49ec-b2c4-688107062877'></a>

# Recommended Hang Time
Recommended hang times for enteral formulas are as follows:
* Formula from powder, formula with additives, and human milk: 4 hours
* Sterile, ready-to-feed formula: 8 hours
* Closed system: 24 hours
* Home blended: 2 hours¹¹

<a id='356363b9-24ec-4e2e-8cd9-f71280c40b5b'></a>

### Administration
### Bolus Feeds
Bolus feeds can only be administered into the stomach via a nasogastric (NG) tube or gastrostomy tube because the stomach provides a reservoir for the feeding, and feeds should not be administered into the jejunum.

<a id='fbc1a8ac-4cc8-48e4-9a6a-7d44da85a991'></a>

## Gravity Feeds

In gravity feeds formula is placed into a feeding syringe and allowed to flow into the tube.

* Minimal equipment is required.
* The rate of administration can be changed by how far the feeding is from the patient. Holding the syringe higher will achieve faster flow, and holding the syringe near the patient will slow the flow.

<a id='c78f965f-5fc8-429f-a615-b0b3a7589a48'></a>

# Syringe Feeds

In syringe feeds, formula is put into the feeding syringe, and a plunger is used to administer the feeds from the syringe into the patient.

* The rate of administration can be controlled.
* Syringe feeds may be required for the administration of blended tube feeds because of the viscosity.

<a id='883e362f-35b0-4d39-ae01-0fd4fffb8452'></a>

# Pump-Assisted Feeds
Pump-assisted feeds require a pump, pole, and necessary supplies.
* Required for jejunal feedings
* More options for feeding rate and duration

<a id='4de507bb-df91-48cf-93bd-9149d16bd647'></a>

**Continuous Feeds**
Continuous feeds require a feeding pump and can be administered in the stomach or small intestine. If patient is mobile, may also require a backpack or bag to transport feeding pump and formula. Pump may be cycled to allow time off.

<a id='644ab610-7b18-486a-a344-fcaadf73330c'></a>

**Initiation of Formula**

EN schedules and delivery methods are patient dependent and should be adjusted based on tolerance of feedings, demonstrated growth, and family preference if the patient is to have home tube feedings. Clinicians should consider the risk of refeeding syndrome when designing the initiation and advancement plans for EN. Slower initiation and advancement and monitoring of electrolytes and physical examination are advised. Table 5-8 discusses the initiation, advancement, and potential goal volumes of enteral feedings. See Appendix 5-1 for EN regimen examples.

Nutrition-Focused Physical Examination Related to Enteral Nutrition

<a id='01032f8c-6de4-414f-a482-3c65f405e898'></a>

Nutrition-focused physical examination (NFPE) is an important tool for clinicians' evaluation of patients receiving EN. Following a head-to-toe assessment method, practitioners should assess for muscle wasting, fat loss, hydration status, and signs of micronutrient deficiencies. Anthropometric measurements should be evaluated to see whether what is recorded in the medical record matches a visual assessment. Additionally, measurements such as mid-upper arm circumference or triceps skin fold may be completed.12

<a id='3e9f3569-a910-47fa-adf6-a7b01dd56604'></a>

For infants and children without known malabsorption issues who are receiving adequate volumes of formula appropriate for sole-source nutrition to meet micronutrient intakes, a physical examination should be tailored to signs of muscle wasting, fat loss, and hydration status while observing for any signs of micronutrient deficiencies (see chapter 1, "Nutrition Screening and History," for further discussion on NFPE).
NFPE should also include a more thorough evaluation of signs and symptoms of micronutrient deficiencies in the following situations:

<a id='c5ec223a-7e01-4f4f-90ad-9944f8d51389'></a>

- Volume of feeds not adequate to meet minimum micronutrient requirements for age without additional supplementation
- Use of home-blended tube feeds, formulas that are not FDA regulated, or formulas that do not have added micronutrients
- Enteral regimens with low provisions of any macronutrients (low fat, low carbohydrate, low protein)
- Known malabsorptive condition or chronic GI losses
- Receiving micronutrient supplementation or other dietary supplements
- Patients with unknown or inconsistent total intakes of enteral formula
- Partial enteral feeds with oral or parenteral nutrition intakes

<a id='1da5c826-f981-401f-b403-78ef498c6b18'></a>

See chapter 1, “Nutrition Screening and History,” Table 1-12 for physical examination findings associated with nutrient deficiencies.

<a id='938637d1-3b19-4041-b1bb-e05697f998d2'></a>

## Medication Administration

Consider the following for medication administration in patients receiving EN:

<a id='60b376ea-fd2c-494a-8eb3-06cb07a04ced'></a>

* Site, size, and type of feeding tube
* Formulation of medication
* Drug-nutrient interactions
* Safety

<a id='6545d342-65a1-4be9-bb45-50d965a90256'></a>

**Feeding Tube Sites**

**Gastric Access**

Gastric access is the preferred administration site if a patient is unable to take medication orally. Generally, larger-bore tubes decrease the risk of clogging.

<a id='8e9681c1-82cc-4ef2-b569-945db0741270'></a>

- The stomach is more tolerant of hypertonic medications than the jejunum.
- A bolus feeding schedule may be used, allowing medication and feeds to be separated for fewer concerns with drug-nutrient interactions and tube clogging.13
- EN should be held 30 minutes before and after administration of ketoconazole, penicillin, and tetracyclines that should be administered on an empty stomach.14

<a id='5fa78095-3874-497c-b7c4-f6e00aec2537'></a>

# Jejunal Access

The following are considerations for jejunal access:

* Hypertonic medications should be diluted with 10–30 mL of sterile water before administration to avoid bloating, nausea, cramping, and diarrhea. 13
* Medications with minimal effects if not administered into the stomach include calcium carbonate, sucralfate, and bismuth.
* There is decreased bioavailability if ketoconazole and itraconazole are not administered into the stomach as a result of the need for acidic activation.
* Some medications may have increased absorption and greater systemic effects when administered into the jejunum, including opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, beta-blockers, and nitrates. 13,14
* There is decreased bioavailability of iron, warfarin, and tacrolimus if administered into the jejunum as a result of usual absorption in the duodenum or proximal to the jejunum. 14

<a id='117bac89-a8c8-487b-93f3-9ebd493984a0'></a>

## *Medication Formulation*
### Liquid Preparations
The preferred method of administering medications via enteral tubes in most scenarios is by using a liquid preparation. Table 5-10 discusses liquid medication preparations.

<a id='d092c01f-21f8-40a8-94be-7913eacbe01b'></a>

<a id='a26a4944-2596-4ce3-b35e-ad048eab4e71'></a>

If a liquid preparation is not available or inappropriate with enteral feedings, certain solid-dose forms of medications can be used.

<a id='f24060ab-f868-4aad-9f22-4ae4b758567b'></a>

## Tablets
Medications that are immediate release and sugar or film coated may be crushed with minimal pharmacokinetic changes to the drug. Tablets should be crushed with a mortar and pestle, then mixed with 15–30 mL of water for administration.

<a id='55b5114d-9dfd-430c-b25e-7ebd5958a293'></a>

# Capsules
Hard gelatin capsules may be opened and the contents diluted in 10–15 mL of water to make a slurry for administration. 13–15 Soft gelatin capsules may be dissolved in warm water and all of the contents given to ensure the entire dose of medication is provided. The undissolved gelatin portion of the capsule should be removed prior to administration. 13,14

<a id='de6ed4dd-b86b-459f-8b06-20ec2951e18d'></a>

# Dose Forms Not Appropriate for Enteral Administration

Dose forms not appropriate for enteral administration include the following:

* Enteric-coated products should not be crushed because it may cause adverse effects in the stomach, decreased drug effectiveness from destruction by gastric acid, or clumping of enteric pieces and clogging of the feeding tube. 13,14
* Buccal or sublingual preparations should not be administered via EADs because they are not designed for absorption in the GI tract and may cause reduced absorption and decreased efficacy.
* Medications with carcinogenic, teratogenic, or cytotoxic properties should not be crushed because of the risk of aerosolized particles that could harm the person administering the medication.
* Extended-release capsules may be opened and the contents administered via an EAD if appropriate; however, crushing the capsules is not recommended because it may lead to toxic peaks and low troughs of medications. 15

<a id='daded6ce-8c23-4e13-9f9b-3ba9ff176d25'></a>

**Safety**
Medications should only be drawn up and dispensed in oral syringes to avoid accidental parenteral administration of an oral formulation of medication. 13,15 If the formulation of the medication is changing, attention should be paid to need for adjusting dose or frequency.

<a id='5982d7e0-e55a-495f-b901-1be04035030b'></a>

# Drug–Formula Incompatibilities
Medications (other than liquid electrolytes) should not be added to enteral formula because of the following risks:

* Physical incompatibilities with acidic syrup and elixirs denaturing the protein in formula (seen more often with intact protein formulas than hydrolyzed or free amino acid formulas)¹³⁻¹⁵
* Decreased drug absorption
* Increased risk of tube occlusions
* Potential microbial contamination
* Suboptimal drug dosing if tube feeding is interrupted¹³

<a id='5102ef78-cac6-4d16-8126-657275fcf7e0'></a>

**Administration of Medication**
Medications should be given as a bolus and separated from EN when possible, using the following procedure:

<a id='79a1e080-9c0a-4347-b5ac-270a667dd860'></a>

1. Flush feeding tube with 15–30 mL water.
2. Administer medication after diluting with water if appropriate.
3. If multiple medications are being provided, flush with 5–10 mL water between each medication.
4. Flush feeding tube with 15–30 mL water.

Adequate flushing of an EAD maintains patency of the tube, reduces risk of occlusion, and ensures drug delivery. 13,14 In smaller children, smaller water flush volumes are recommended. 13,15 Dilution of medication should also be with smaller volumes in pediatric patients. A minimum of 50:50 medication and water should be used with a 5-mL water flush if not restricted in volume.15

When administering medication with continuous feeding, EN may need to be interrupted multiple times per day depending on the frequency of dosing. It may be necessary to alter the feeding rate to compensate for time that formula was held during drug delivery, particularly if the medications provided require administration on an empty stomach. With bolus and intermittent feeding schedules, medication can generally be scheduled around feedings.

* Ciprofloxacin
* Doxycycline
* Isoniazid
* Levofloxacin
* Ofloxacin
* Penicillin
* Rifampicin
* Phenytoin

Other studies suggest a longer duration of feeding interruptions of 1–
2 hours before and after administration.16 Collaboration with a
pharmacist should occur when starting new medications or initiating EN
to ensure the appropriate safety and administration of medications with
EN.
