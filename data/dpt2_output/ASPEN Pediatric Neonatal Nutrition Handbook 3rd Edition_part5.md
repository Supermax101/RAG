## Managing Discontinuation of PN

As EN intake improves, PN can be decreased in a stepwise fashion. The volume and rate, macronutrient doses, and micronutrient doses can be decreased by a percentage based on EN advancement until the PN is less than 30%-50% intake. The doses should be low enough to allow for

<a id='7da4536a-d773-4168-ada8-5630b00d254f'></a>

discontinuation. Cyclic PN can be considered in patients who are able to eat but experience poor appetite while receiving PN or for those who will be discharged on home PN. PN can be transitioned from 24 to 12 hours over 3–4 days based on amount of EN intake and blood glucose levels measured at the high rate of PN cycle and when off PN. There are a variety of methods to taper up and taper down, but generally, a smaller rate is infused for 30–60 minutes for 1–2 hours at the beginning of the infusion and at the end of the infusion with a higher rate for the middle hours. As the infant grows and receives more EN, the PN infusion time can be decreased as mentioned previously.45 A general rule of thumb is to not exceed twice maintenance volume for any hourly rate. If blood glucose is greater than 150 mg/dL, consider decreasing the GIR or if hypoglycemia is present when patient off PN, consider increasing PN hours or tapering PN over a longer period at the end of the cyclic infusion.46

# Nutrition-Focused Physical Examination for PN

Nutrition-focused physical examination (NFPE) is an an important piece of the nutrition evaluation of patients receiving PN. Following a head-to-toe assessment method, evaluation of muscle wasting, fat loss, hydration status, and signs of micronutrient deficiencies is essential. Recorded anthropometrics should be evaluated against physical examination to assess accuracy. Additional measurements of MUAC and triceps skinfold may be completed. Patients receiving PN should have hair, eyes, mouth, skin, and nails evaluated, paying particular attention to signs of copper, selenium, zinc, iron, vitamin A, and vitamin D deficiencies. See chapter 1, "Nutrition Screening and History," for more details on NFPE.

# Long-Term PN Management

If PN continues for weeks to months, then it is considered long-term PN, and metabolic monitoring frequency may be adjusted based on stability of the patient. Increasing the interval between blood draws may decrease

<a id='35bce709-98d7-41d9-bdd1-52f3cd530c3f'></a>

the anemia associated with chronic disease and iron-deficient anemia.
The need for nutrition-related monitoring as listed in Tables 6-11 and 6-
18 will now be required in prolonged PN because of the risk of vitamin
and mineral deficiencies.47

Patients on long-term PN generally receive no to minimal EN or are unable to adequately absorb enough EN for enteral autonomy and therefore are at risk for a variety of nutrition deficiencies. Multivitamin and trace minerals are added to PN but may provide too much or too little supplement, which is why periodic monitoring is required with

<a id='9039147c-d02d-4b5f-b905-47a45e2a42c7'></a>

subsequent additive modification. If individual injectable vitamins,
minerals, and other nutrient additives are not available from a
manufacturer or are in short supply, enteral supplements can be initiated
with close monitoring.

<a id='5603dd3c-5cff-4658-999f-eba5a8d6974b'></a>

Growth and development are monitored routinely by a multidisciplinary team through clinic, virtual, or phone visits with subsequent adjustments in PN with the goal of EN autonomy as able. Monitoring for mechanical complications such as infiltration, catheter dislodgement, thrombus, embolism, and catheter-related blood stream infections are continuous through the therapy. Clinicians rely on home infusion nurses and caregivers to monitor for signs and symptoms of these complications with immediate notification so that appropriate care can be administered.48 Education about sterile technique, limiting blood draws, and avoiding sick contacts are strategies used to decrease central line infections. Close communication with patient and caregivers can reinforce the aforementioned strategies and aid in evaluating the routine monitoring parameters.

## APPENDIX 6-1. Sample Parenteral Nutrition Plan

T.B. is a 10-year-old patient with a past surgical history of gastroschisis repair who comes to the emergency department with abdominal pain and vomiting for the past 5 days and report of being unable to tolerate any food by mouth. An abdominal computed tomography scan demonstrated dilated bowel with air fluid levels. She was taken to the operating room (OR) where it was found she had adhesive bowel disease and underwent a lysis of adhesions. Her nutrition was assessed postoperatively, and she received a diagnosis of moderate malnutrition (weight-for-length z score) of -2.3. Based on findings in the OR (anticipated prolonged nothing-by-mouth status) and her nutrition, it was decided that parenteral nutrition (PN) therapy should be initiated. A peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line was placed by Interventional Radiology.

# Overview
The nutrition needs for the growth and development of neonates and infants are unique compared with those of other pediatric populations because of physiologic immaturity and significant nutrition demands of growth. The nutrition support plan for these patients will depend on a detailed nutrition assessment, starting with an assessment of maturity by gestational age (GA), the birth weight classification, and size assessment for GA, which provides an indicator of the intrauterine growth history. 1,2 The neonatal period refers to the first 28 days of infant life, and infants may be born full term, late preterm, or preterm (Table 7-1).3 Birth weight classification will help to determine nutrition needs (Table 7-2) and, along with size assessment (Table 7-3), will help to identify infants who may have increased nutrition risk and neonatal morbidities due an alteration in intrauterine growth.¹ Growth is assessed regularly by using an appropriate growth chart, and the nutrition support plan is modified as needed to achieve goals. Hospitalized term and preterm infants often require specialized nutrition support (enteral and parenteral) because of increased energy and protein needs for growth, clinical status, immature oral feeding skills, and gastrointestinal (GI) immaturity. See Table 7-4 for indications for enteral nutrition (EN) and parenteral nutrition (PN) support. EN and PN require careful initiation, advancement, and monitoring and will be reviewed in this chapter.

**Growth Monitoring and Assessment**

Infant weight, length, and head circumference should be measured regularly and plotted on an appropriate chart. Preterm infants should be plotted on an intrauterine reference growth chart, and term infants should be plotted on the World Health Organization (WHO) growth standard charts (Table 7-5).4,5 Although intrauterine growth serves as the model for preterm infants, the currently available cross-sectional references are limited, and ultimately the pattern of growth over time provides the best indication of nutrition status and growth outcomes.

Growth monitoring and assessment in the first 1–2 weeks should focus on the degree of weight loss compared with birth weight and regaining birth weight by at least day of life 14 in the setting of stable or euvolemic fluid status and adequate nutrition intake.<sup>6,7</sup> After the first 2 weeks, weight gain velocity is assessed over 5- to 7-day periods.<sup>8,9</sup> Length and head circumference should be measured weekly and assessed on the growth chart after the first 2–3 weeks. Weekly assessment of growth velocity should be paired with assessment of the growth pattern by using z scores (Table 7-6).<sup>6,7,10</sup>

The current goal for neonates and preterm infants is to maintain the growth trajectory within approximately 1 SD of the birth weight z score; however, there is some debate about whether birth weight or a postdiuresis weight should be used, given the expected physiologic weight loss that occurs as the extracellular water (ECW) contracts in postnatal diuresis.11 In current practice, the focus should be on following the pattern of growth, ideally parallel to the growth chart curves, while also monitoring weight growth velocities and z score changes over time.12

<a id='8e46c457-fdab-4406-a004-511252e45ccf'></a>

## Energy and Protein Needs

Term infants require energy and protein intakes to support optimal health, development, and a normal growth trajectory. Preterm infants require increased energy and protein intakes to account for the lack of nutrient stores at birth and accumulated nutrition deficits and to support gradual catch-up growth. Energy and protein intake needs for preterm infants are determined based on the physiologic requirements to achieve an adequate rate and composition of growth and weight gain compared with a fetus of similar size and GA.<sup>13</sup>

<a id='46866ed8-4445-4d36-98c8-8961e14ed6ed'></a>

## Energy Needs
Total energy needs are determined by considering the basal energy requirements, energy cost of growth, energy requirements of physical activity and stress, and thermic effect of food and the energy need for temperature regulation.13.14 The goal is to provide adequate early energy intake to prevent breakdown of the limited energy stores a neonate may have, while also accounting for energy that is needed for growth. Energy needs can vary significantly over the first days and weeks and should be assessed regularly. A variety of factors may influence the energy expenditure of a hospitalized term or preterm infant14:
* Physical activity
* Dietary intake
* Environmental interactions
* Clinical conditions
* Medications

<a id='41b8f6bb-84ce-48f6-a57e-8cecff9a915a'></a>

Measurement of energy expenditure by using indirect calorimetry in neonates, although possible, is not widely used because of a lack of available expertise and equipment at most centers as well as technical limitations such as complex clinical status and mechanical ventilation modalities. It is especially challenging for preterm infants because of size, feeding schedules, and respiratory support modalities, and it is not typically used outside of the research setting. 15,16 Predictive equations are not generally used in neonates, as they have not been shown to correctly predict energy expenditure in infants. 16 Growth remains the gold standard for the assessment of energy requirements.

<a id='7576b1d0-e2d3-4912-8762-8f46f369568a'></a>

Parenterally fed infants typically require less energy than enterally fed infants, as the energy cost of digestion and absorption is lower with intravenous nutrient delivery, and there are reduced fecal energy losses. 14 An additional 30 kcal/kg/d is required for enterally fed neonates to account for these differences. 13 Parenteral and enteral energy requirements for term and preterm infants are listed in Tables 7-7 and 7-8. Some infants will require energy intakes greater than the amounts listed to achieve adequate growth.

# Protein Needs

Human milk serves as the model for determining protein needs for neonates and informs the recommended intakes for full-term infants, which are estimated at about 1.5 g/kg/d, but the exact requirements are not defined, given the variability of human milk composition over the course of lactation. 17 Preterm and low birth weight (LBW) infants require higher protein intake to account for the increased growth rates while also considering catch-up growth. Protein requirements are estimated from fetal accretion rates and the intake required to achieve a rate of growth and body composition of a fetus of similar GA. 18 The optimal protein dose and composition for PN and EN are listed in Tables 7-7 and 7-8.19 Human milk with added human milk fortifiers and preterm infant formulas will meet protein intake goals when infants are fed at least 120 kcal/kg/d. Full-term infants receiving an exclusively human milk diet require approximately 1.5 g/kg/d of protein, and full-term formula-fed infants require between 2 and 2.5 g/kg/d of protein.

phosphorus is influenced by postnatal age and intake of vitamin D, lactose, and fat. In preterm infants,

<a id='5679ad8f-a646-40ce-8ca2-c83da6c95e0f'></a>

however, vitamin D may contribute little to calcium absorption. 20 Similarly, vitamins are supplied to the fetus via maternal transfer. Water-soluble vitamins are actively transported across the placenta throughout pregnancy, whereas the fat-soluble vitamins A, D and E are transferred during the last trimester of pregnancy. There is negligible transfer of vitamin K.21

## Fluid Needs

Fluid requirements for the neonate should be based on weight and clinical condition. In the first few days of life, fluid intake should be individualized based on ongoing changes in weight, urine output, and sodium status. At birth, fluid intake is approximately 70–80 mL/kg/d and gradually increases to 150 mL/kg/d by the end of the first week of life.²² Requirements are inversely related to GA, reaching as high as 100ml/kg/d on the first day of life in the extremely LBW (ELBW) infant.²³ At birth, there is a physiologic loss of sodium because of the normal contraction of extracellular volume. In comparison with term infants, preterm infants have higher total body water and ECW per kilogram. The extent of contraction of the ECW compartment is greater in small-for-GA infants than in appropriate-for-GA infants. During the first week of life, term infants exhibit a 5%–7% weight loss, whereas preterm infants may exhibit a 10%–15% weight loss.²⁴ Depending on other clinical characteristics, fluid requirements may reach as high as 200ml/kg/d. Achieving the right balance is key, as excessive fluids could potentially increase the risk of patent ductus arteriosus and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC).²⁵

**Neonatal Parenteral Nutrition**

*Indications*

Because of their low nutrient reserves at birth, many preterm and LBW infants require parenteral nutrition (PN) until they are able sustain themselves enterally. The immaturity of their intestinal tract and the paucity of digestive enzymes makes it difficult for the preterm infant to digest nutrients enterally.

<a id='c0bd6887-6ea3-4a1d-bb8e-343af3e60fcb'></a>

**Venous Access**

The type of vascular access and the location of the catheter will dictate the type of PN formulation that can be safely infused. The location of the catheter tip in the central venous circulation is crucial for the infusion of hypertonic PN solutions.<sup>26</sup> Central location reduces the risk of thrombus and vascular intimal damage. A central catheter tip location allows for instantaneous dilution of hypertonic PN solution (>900 mOsm/L) into the blood stream. In children, the superior vena cava (SVC), the junction of the SVC and the right atrium, the brachiocephalic/SVC junction, and the inferior vena cava above the bifurcation of the iliac veins all are considered central locations for the catheter tip placement and offer the largest-caliber lumen and high blood flows.<sup>26</sup> Documentation of catheter tip location by radiographic confirmation is required for PN administration because malpositioned catheters can have serious and even fatal consequences.

<a id='ef2477cf-51b4-43d3-a5b7-fc5ce50195b8'></a>

Peripheral vascular access may be used to infuse PN, but the final osmolarity must be less than 900 mOsm/L to decrease the risk of phlebitis.27 This limits the amount of protein, dextrose, and electrolytes that can be delivered. Patients receiving PN via the peripheral route must be able to tolerate higher volumes of fluid to meet their nutrition goals because a more dilute PN must be used. Table 7-9 lists the osmolarity of commonly use PN fluids. The following equation shows one method of determining PN osmolarity:

# Fluid Requirements

Typically, maintenance fluid is provided with the PN solution. Maintenance fluid requirements can be assessed by using the Holliday-Segar method (see Table 4-5 in chapter 4, "Infant to Adolescent").  Fluid requirements can be higher when there are increased insensible losses (fever or tachypnea) or sensible losses (diarrhea, nasogastric [NG] output, ostomy losses, polyuria, or vomiting). In certain clinical situations, such as cardiac, hepatic, or renal dysfunction, fluids may need to be restricted. Fluid needs will vary with a variety of clinical and environmental conditions (Table 7-10). Therefore, routine clinical monitoring of hydration status, including electrolytes and intakes and outputs, is essential for neonates receiving PN. Table 7-11 lists the _estimated_ electrolyte losses and typical replacement fluids used in various GI losses; however, precise quantification is possible by sending a specimen to the chemistry laboratory for measurement of electrolyte concentrations.

<a id='31c85363-576d-4b84-bc02-ecb36b867da6'></a>

In the parenterally fed patient, if the patient's fluid requirements are being met but their energy needs are not, it is generally recommended to increase the volume of PN administered rather than to increase the concentration of nutrients in the PN. This reduces the need to infuse hypertonic solutions, which are more damaging to the intima of blood vessels.29 This approach assumes that the patient's cardiovascular and renal systems can tolerate the increased volume of parenteral fluids.

<a id='e35fedef-5a42-45f7-adb8-4827bd08b0c6'></a>

### Components of PN
In neonatal PN solutions, dextrose, amino acids, electrolytes, and micronutrients are typically provided in a single solution. Because of stability limitations, lipid injectable emulsions (ILEs) are usually infused separately from the dextrose–protein solution. In circumstances in which severe fluid restriction is necessary, the fluid from the fat emulsion is considered in the total fluid allotment.29 In most cases, however, fluid provision from fat emulsion is calculated in addition to the PN volume.

<a id='b247339d-f428-4e5b-9da4-e5f74f95ccae'></a>

## Macronutrients
To achieve optimal growth, neonatal PN contains protein calories (as crystalline amino acids) and nonprotein calories as carbohydrates (as dextrose) and fat (in the form of an ILE). Table 7-12 describes the energy density of these components. Table 7-13 summarizes current recommendations for macronutrient initiation and advancement in the parenterally fed neonate.

ª A normal nonprotein energy (kilocalories)/nitrogen (grams) ratio is between 150:1 and 250:1. The ratio is calculated as follows: nonprotein energy (kilocalories)/nitrogen (grams) ratio = (carbohydrate calories + fat calories)/(protein intake in grams/6.25).

<a id='58df3a63-c01b-4040-b4ff-3d6249609a08'></a>

b To convert from % dextrose to mg/kg/min, use the following formula: % dextrose × (1 dL/100 mL) × (1000 mg/1 g) × (hourly infusion rate in mL/h) × (1 h/60 min) × (1/weight in kg). For example, 10% dextrose infusing at 10 mL/h in a 3 kg infant is calculated as follows: 10 × (1/100 mL) × (1000 mg/1 g) × (10 mL/h) × (1 h/60 min) × (1/3 kg) = 5.6 mg/kg/min
c Additional calories are provided by phospholipid emulsifiers and glycerol.

# Protein

Because of hepatic immaturity and different requirements, special crystalline amino acid formulations have been developed (Table 7-14). In comparison with traditional amino acid products, these products are designed to mimic the plasma amino acid profiles of the healthy breastfed infant. Pediatric amino acid formulations contain less methionine, phenylalanine, and glycine and are supplemented with the semi-essential amino acids taurine, glutamic acid, and aspartic acid. Because of stability limitations, cysteine is added at the time of compounding. In addition to improving nitrogen balance and normalizing the plasma amino acid profile in the neonate, cysteine decreases the pH of the PN, thus improving calcium and phosphorus solubility. Given that it is a chloride salt, cysteine may also predispose the neonate to metabolic acidosis.

Traditional doses of cysteine range from 20 to 40 mg per gram of amino acids. In times of shortage,
to conserve supplies, cysteine should be reserved for neonates weighing less than 1 kg, in whom
cysteine has been shown to improve nitrogen balance. Specially formulated amino acid blends may be
extemporaneously compounded from individual amino acids for infants with inborn errors of
metabolism (eg, maple syrup urine disease).

<a id='521765dd-7a57-40aa-9e55-87d428e74547'></a>

To prevent additional losses, protein is dosed as high as 4g/kg/d in preterm neonates receiving "starter PN." For term neonates, dosing begins as 2-3 g/kg/d with a goal dose of 2.5-3 g/kg/d (Table 7-

<a id='32e9b4ec-6d40-405d-b78a-a28abf044055'></a>

13). Although some centers may advance protein provision more slowly (ie, 0.5g/kg/d), there is no evidence to support that practice. Protein doses of 1g/kg/d have been shown to prevent negative nitrogen balance and minimize the risk of hyperkalemia.30 To prevent catabolism and additional protein losses, it is important that protein be provided in addition to dextrose soon after birth. Infants only provided dextrose-containing fluids would continue to break down muscle mass that is difficult to regain.

<a id='40988a35-328b-463c-9909-2bafea43efd8'></a>

_**Carbohydrates**_

<a id='5d9f1cba-cb82-498e-aaf4-488078d000ff'></a>

Anhydrous dextrose is the form of carbohydrate used in PN. To meet the neonate's obligatory needs, it is initiated at a minimum glucose infusion rate (GIR) of 5–8mg/kg/min. Depending on tolerance, dextrose is gradually advanced to a GIR of 12–15 mg/kg/min. Use of insulin is avoided, and ILE provision can be altered to offset the loss of carbohydrate calories in glucose-intolerant neonates. Table 7-13 provides dextrose advancement guidelines.

<a id='f7b3d1e7-2ed7-4155-a714-54eb5f4b5027'></a>

**Fat**

In the parenterally fed neonate, fat is provided as an ILE. These are isotonic emulsions containing an oil source, glycerin, and an egg yolk phospholipid emulsifying agent. In addition to providing an alternative to dextrose as a nonprotein calorie source, these products provide essential fatty acids (EFAs). Similar to human milk, about 40%–50% of total PN calories are provided as fat. At doses of 2–3 g/kg/d, fat can improve protein retention. 31

<a id='199915f8-0415-4c8f-b997-0941fabf7201'></a>

There are currently 3 ILE formulations approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for pediatric use (see chapter 6, "Parenteral Nutrition," Table 6-6). A pure soy oil ILE may theoretically increase the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP).³¹ Recently approved products have reduced amounts of the proinflammatory fatty acids and higher amounts of omega-3 fatty acids that may also be less hepatotoxic.

<a id='8be2ea71-5188-4c66-9b7e-57d6119778f2'></a>

Because of differences in oil composition, different dosing strategies for ILE products must be used to prevent EFA deficiency (EFAD) (see chapter 6, "Parenteral Nutrition," Table 6-6). Preterm infants lose out on maternal transfer of the EFAs docosahexaenoic acid and arachidonic acid, and, moreover, because of hepatic immaturity, are inefficient at synthesizing these EFAs from their respective precursors α-linolenic acid and linolenic acid. Using products that contain these preformed EFAs may be beneficial in this population, but evidence is still lacking.

<a id='f5711013-c0f1-406a-8933-113312b41e6a'></a>

Serum triglyceride (TG) levels should be monitored for ILE tolerance. The goal is to have serum TG levels less than 250 mg/dL. Infants prone to hypertriglyceridemia should have their lipids infused over 24 hours at an ILE infusion rate not to exceed 0.15–0.17 g/kg/h (depending on ILE product).31 Because of low amounts of lipoprotein lipase in their capillary epithelium that facilitates TG metabolism, infants may benefit from the addition of heparin to the PN at 0.5–1 U/mL of PN to induce the enzyme and improve clearance.32 The addition of the lysine derivative levocarnitine has also been shown to help manage hypertriglyceridemia by transporting long-chain TGs across the cell membrane into the mitochondria.33

<a id='abd9b408-12ea-453a-9db4-58a7498db7e6'></a>

**Micronutrients**
Preterm infants are born deficient in many micronutrients. Most maternal transfer of these vitamins, minerals, and electrolytes occurs in the third trimester of growth. The more premature the neonate, the greater the requirements. Table 7-15 summarizes the ASPEN-recommended PN electrolyte and mineral daily doses.

# Sodium

Because of the normal contraction of extracellular volume in the first days of life, there is a loss of sodium. Because of their inability to conserve sodium, the amount of sodium the preterm infant requires is greater than that of the term neonate. Sodium is an important growth factor. Failure to provide adequate sodium can result in a growth failure. 34 Monitoring urine sodium is preferred, although its utility is limited in infants receiving diuretics. Although not perfect, measurement of the urine sodium concentration allows assessment of total body sodium stores. 35 Current best practice suggests that in patients with normal and mature renal function, urine sodium higher than 30 mEq/L is reflective of a positive sodium balance, measurements less than 30 mEq/L represent total body sodium depletion, and measurements less than 10 mEq/L indicate a severe deficit.

**_Potassium_**
Potassium is the major intracellular cation responsible for muscle contractility and cardiac function. It is influenced by acid–base status. Acidosis causes potassium to move from cells to extracellular fluid in exchange for hydrogen ions, whereas alkalosis causes the reverse movement of potassium and hydrogen ions.36 Preterm infants tend to have higher serum potassium levels at birth, but it gradually decreases. Supplementation at 1–2 mEq/kg/d should be done once adequate urine output is established.37

**Calcium and Phosphorus**

To avoid hypophosphatemia and optimize bone mineralization, high intakes of both calcium and phosphorus are necessary. In clinically stable, growing preterm infants, calcium intake of 65–100 mg of elemental calcium and 60–80 mg of phosphorus is recommended. In addition to optimizing intake, the proper ratio of calcium and phosphorus in also required to promote bone mineralization. ASPEN recommends a ratio of 1.3:1 (molar ratio) or 1.7:1 (mass ratio) of calcium to phosphorus. Others have suggested ratios of 1.7:1 (mg/mg) or as low as 1.1:1 (mg/mg).38 Failure to provide the proper intake of calcium and phosphorus at the proper ratios can result in electrolyte derangements. If amino acids are provided without sufficient phosphorus, hypophosphatemia and hypercalcemia can result. Likewise,

<a id='e743ff97-5f55-4853-80be-bb8aaa83a6d1'></a>

hypercalcemia can occur if inadequate phosphorus is provided or high calcium/phosphorus ratios are used. Provision of calcium without phosphorus or phosphorus without calcium should be avoided, as proper bone mineralization requires provision of both.

<a id='e7d708e1-e6d6-4cf5-a072-7a7c997cecff'></a>

Monitoring of the calcium and phosphorus status takes additional factors into consideration. In patients with hypoalbuminemia, serum calcium levels must be adjusted, or an ionized serum calcium should be obtained, recognizing that acidosis can increase ionized calcium. To properly interpret whether intake is adequate, a serum phosphorus level should be obtained at the same time. Age-based normal ranges should be used because errors in interpretation can occur when the wrong age range is applied while assessing phosphorus status.39 In patients with hypomagnesemia, the magnesium status should be corrected prior to correcting calcium stores, as the 2 are interrelated. Similarly, significant hyperphosphatemia should be corrected prior to correcting hypocalcemia to minimize the risk of soft-tissue calcification if [Ca2+] × [PO43-]>70.40

One of the challenges in providing adequate calcium and phosphorus in the parenterally fed neonate is avoiding precipitation in the PN solution. Calcium-phosphate crystals can form, which can result in pulmonary thromboembolism. There are multiple factors that increase the risk of precipitation (Table 7-16). Given the risk and the wide variability of predisposing factors to precipitation, it is imperative that all PN is infused through a 1.2-µm inline filter (0.2 µm may be used if there are no ILEs being infused through the same catheter).41

**_Magnesium_**
Magnesium, like calcium, is influenced by albumin status and the following formula can be used to correct serum magnesium levels in the presence of hypoalbuminemia.⁴²

<a id='bf53e531-8646-4cc4-b8c9-716538a60274'></a>

Ionized magnesium levels are available but less frequently used. Typically, magnesium can be provided upon initiation of PN in the neonate. The exception is the neonate born to the mother who has received magnesium to treat preeclampsia during delivery. Magnesium concentrations tend to be elevated in these infants prior to starting PN, and provision in the PN should be held until they are normalized.

<a id='26940dc3-583d-45f3-8408-687ba57809bf'></a>

**Anion Balance**
Patients developing acidosis while receiving PN may benefit from the addition of base to the solution in the form of sodium or potassium acetate salts. Bicarbonate should never be added to the PN, as it may result in precipitation of calcium and phosphate. 43 Chloride-free PNs should be avoided, as they may predispose patients to metabolic alkalosis.44

# Levocarnitine

The ability of preterm infants to oxidize fatty acids is related to their limited carnitine stores. Carnitine is necessary in long-chain fatty acid transport into the mitochondrial matrix for β-oxidation.45 Carnitine is obtained from the diet or synthesized endogenously from the amino acids lysine and methionine. Neonates weighing less than 5 kg are generally carnitine deficient and will require that carnitine in the form of levocarnitine be added to their PN at an initial dose of 2–5 mg/kg/d.46 Higher doses up to 10–20 mg/kg/d may be necessary in patients who have elevated TG levels or are receiving PN for longer than 7 days. Both free and total plasma carnitine concentrations should be monitored. To evaluate for carnitine deficiency, the plasma acylcarnitine/free carnitine (A/F) ratio should be used47:

<a id='e3720050-c211-4ef5-a1e4-da62152ea76a'></a>

A/F ratio = (plasma total carnitine – free carnitine)/(free carnitine)

<a id='204b9767-bc23-48ba-af28-109ce5c83729'></a>

A normal plasma A/F ratio is 0.25; carnitine deficiency is associated with an A/F ratio greater than 0.4.

<a id='84b289e8-61c6-44e5-b5ce-1a18a0711303'></a>

# Trace Elements
Maternal transfer of approximately two-thirds of zinc, copper, and iron to the fetus occurs during the last 10–12 weeks of gestation. 48 Infants born at 28–30 weeks of gestation, weighing less than 1 kg are born with limited stores. Trace elements commonly added to PN solutions include zinc, copper, selenium, manganese, and chromium. For term infants requiring short (ie, <2 weeks) courses of PN, it may not be necessary to provide them, but they should be provided to preterm neonates upon PN initiation. In particular, zinc and copper are necessary for growth, and serious complications have been reported when they have not been provided. Table 7-17 provides the typical doses of the most commonly supplemented trace elements. Because of biliary excretion of copper and manganese, these trace elements should be reduced in patients with cholestasis. Similarly, parenteral intake of selenium and chromium should be reduced or held in cases of renal dysfunction. If a multi-ingredient trace element mixture is used, practitioners should take the amount provided by the product into consideration when determining the added amount to supplement (Table 7-18).

# Zinc

Zinc is an essential trace element necessary for metabolism of energy and growth. Neonates receiving zinc-free PN for prolonged periods are at risk for growth retardation, infections, and a distinctive rash (ie, acrodermatitis enteropathica). Some infants will require higher intakes of zinc. Infants with short bowel syndrome or excessive diarrhea from other causes may require significantly higher amounts of zinc. For such neonates, it is common practice to add additional zinc to help replace those losses.⁴⁹

Assessment of zinc status by monitoring serum zinc concentrations is inaccurate, as it does not reflect total body stores of zinc. A better way to assess zinc status is by monitoring alkaline phosphatase concentrations. In states of zinc deficiency, serum alkaline phosphatase levels will also be depressed.⁵⁰

<a id='ce1bc5af-75f3-425e-8174-84594047e030'></a>

**_Copper_**

<a id='fba7bcb1-45d6-4679-8bf4-6df6dc8d8363'></a>

Like zinc, copper is also important to infant growth. It is also important for bone health, as copper deficiency can affect the epiphyses of the bone and cupping can occur. Because of biliary excretion of copper, it should be reduced in patients with cholestasis. Copper should not be eliminated totally without monitoring levels periodically, as individuals on long-term PN with intestinal failure-associated liver disease (IFALD) can develop hypocupremia. This can result in anemia, thrombocytopenia, osteopenia, and neutropenia.51 Cases of microcytic hypochromic anemia unresponsive to iron supplementation are suggestive of copper deficiency. As the serum level of copper is influenced by that of ceruloplasmin, both should be considered when interpreting copper levels. The following formula can be used to more accurately assess copper status52:

<a id='d88ad5cd-169a-49b7-b160-e122a6630147'></a>

Adjusted copper in mol/L = (total copper in mol/L) +
(0.052  ceruloplasmin in mg/L) + (17.5 mol/L)

<a id='8853639e-0092-434e-a1e8-b8854c7176cf'></a>

### Selenium
The addition of selenium may be necessary after 30 days of PN and no or minimal enteral intake. Neonates with intestinal failure may have greater selenium losses due to diarrhea or ostomy losses. In infants, selenium deficiency is associated with growth retardation and alopecia with pseudoalbinism, which are reversible with adequate supplementation. ⁵³ Selenium intake should be reduced in cases of renal dysfunction.

<a id='63938683-c6ac-4632-9cb1-e3f62bd5027c'></a>

**Chromium**
Early hyperglycemia is prevalent in preterm infants receiving PN therapy. Chromium improves glucose tolerance by potentiating the action of insulin. Although important in glucose tolerance, newer trace element mixtures do not contain it (Table 7-18). PN chromium supplementation has been shown to improve glucose tolerance and calorie delivery during the first week of life, especially in very LBW (VLBW) infants.54

<a id='d9284eeb-6848-4bf0-b0eb-8386f13e3a13'></a>

_**Manganese**_

Manganese is a component of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase, which helps fight free radicals. There may be sufficient manganese contamination that routine supplementation may not be necessary. 55 Manganese neurotoxicity is a concern in neonates receiving PN.56 If manganese toxicity is suspected, manganese should be removed from the PN and erythrocyte manganese levels and a 24-hour urine manganese level should be obtained.57 There are reports of abnormal cranial magnetic resonance imaging findings consistent with manganese deposition, a concern for neonates receiving long-term PN who may be at risk of neurocognitive dysfunction due to prematurity and other preexisting medical problems. 58 If IFALD is present, manganese is usually removed or dose reduced from PN.58

<a id='064102ba-1c5c-4a02-8c1c-e990946138d8'></a>

**Vitamins**

The importance of vitamins in neonates receiving PN has been underscored in the United States by several widespread shortages of parenteral multivitamins and reports of symptomatic thiamine deficiency.59 Vitamin deficiencies have been reported in patients receiving vitamin-free PN in as little as a few weeks. Table 7-19 describes the current pediatric parenteral vitamin products available in the United States.

In comparison with the products intended for patients older than age 11, the pediatric versions of multivitamins are notable for higher amounts of vitamins K and D and lower amounts of the B vitamins. Certain patient conditions may require adjustments to their parenteral vitamin intake. For example, patients with high GI fistula output may require a double dose of multivitamins because of increased losses.<sup>60</sup> Patients with prolonged prothrombin times may benefit from short courses of supplemental vitamin K.

<a id='1ac03eab-7159-4b03-ac96-595eb5cd244f'></a>

In the event of a parenteral multivitamin shortage, it is imperative that practitioners provide adequate thiamine with dextrose infusions to avoid metabolic lactic acidosis. Adult parenteral multivitamins should never be used in the neonate because of the propylene glycol and polysorbates contained in many of these products that could be toxic to a neonate.61 Adult multivitamin products contain less vitamin D and K and may increase the risk of metabolic bone disease in neonates on long-term PN therapy. Neonates who must receive PN without conventional pediatric parenteral multivitamins should always receive parenteral thiamine in the PN at a dose of 0.03 mg/kg/d.62 There is currently no parenteral vitamin preparation designed especially for preterm infants, and there is some controversy concerning vitamin requirements for these patients.62 Table 7-20 describes the recommended levels of intake for parenteral multivitamins for term and preterm infants.

*Other Additives*

**Heparin**

Heparin is often added to neonatal PN, especially those infusing via a central venous catheter (CVC). Limited evidence suggests that the addition of heparin to neonatal PN may reduce the incidence of CVC occlusion.63 When used as a PN additive to maintain catheter patency doses of 0.5–1 U/mL (final heparin concentration in the PN solution) have been used.46 The final concentration of heparin used for PN solutions may need to be reduced in smaller neonates receiving large PN volumes to avoid approaching therapeutic doses.

# Insulin

Because the risk of hypoglycemia outweighs the potential benefits of insulin on growth, the addition of insulin to PN is not recommended.64

## Special Situations

### Starter PN

Evidence has demonstrated that early PN administration in preterm LBW neonates can improve growth and potentially neurodevelopment. Within hours of delivery, a solution of protein (as amino acids, fat [in the form of ILE], and carbohydrates [as dextrose]) is administered until a customized PN can be compounded. Also, referred to as "vanilla bags" or "day of life 1 PN," these solutions are started soon

<a id='589d95db-d448-414e-aa68-16f9922ae1f6'></a>

after birth and are intended to prevent the catabolic processes that can result in additional muscle mass loss. These solutions provide sufficient energy and protein and sufficient calcium to prevent hypocalcemia. Typical starter PNs contain dextrose, amino acids, and calcium but are free of sodium, potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus. Some programs also provide ILE as part of the starter PN provision. 65

<a id='7f2418ff-f137-4d09-9048-331a1ed612fe'></a>

Term neonates should also be provided PN if they are unable to receive enteral feedings for more than 2–3 days. The glycogen and fat stores are rapidly depleted, and the neonate will become catabolic and break down their protein stores for energy. Neonates with severe respiratory failure, congenital heart defects, or NEC often receive PN initially. 66

**Compounding PN for the Neonate**

In addition to the calcium and phosphorus compatibility issues, other compounding factors have been the focus of recent attention in hopes of preventing PN-related complications in the neonate. These include minimizing aluminum exposure, protecting the solutions from light, and avoidance of di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate-containing materials. Preterm infants and children with intestinal failure have immature or diminished antioxidant defenses that render them more susceptible to oxidant stress that can influence the selection of many PN additives.

<a id='f7300362-10d4-44e9-bbdc-89fae8b3a2b7'></a>

Practitioners responsible for overseeing the compounding of PN solutions for neonates must be familiar with the differences in additive formulations and the impact that any potential product substitution may pose to this fragile population. In times of shortages, a proactive approach to conserve and prioritize supplies for neonates requiring PN and being aware of expert opinions and guidelines as the drug shortages crisis continues are necessary.

## Ambient Light

When PN is exposed to ambient light, hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxides are generated.<sup>67</sup> There is an approximate 50% reduction in the amount of hydrogen peroxide generated when the entire PN solution and delivery system is protected from ambient light (ie, amino acid dextrose bag, lipid syringe, and tubing).<sup>68,69</sup> This interaction was first reported in the early 1980s when it was observed that light exposure might cause vitamin instability, but most practitioners still choose not to cover solutions, especially if the multivitamins are added immediately prior to infusing. Multivitamins, however, are not the only component of PN that may be impacted by light. The amino acids tryptophan and tyrosine undergo photo-oxidation to form free radicals with hepatotoxic properties.<sup>70</sup> Other amino acids such as cysteine, histidine, and methionine are also prone to photo-oxidation. By serving as a photosensitizing agent, riboflavin appears to facilitate the photo-oxidation process.<sup>68</sup> Lipid emulsions are also negatively impacted by exposure to ambient light. Phototherapy might cause significant peroxidation to ILE, resulting in the formation of cytotoxic TG hydroperoxides.<sup>71</sup> Lipid hydroperoxides have been linked with pulmonary vasoconstriction via an interference with endogenous prostaglandin synthesis.<sup>72</sup> Recently, ASPEN issued recommendations for the use of photoprotection of PN and ILE but recognized that the limitations to the ability of available products to ensure complete photoprotection are still a major obstacle for implementation.<sup>73</sup>

_**Di(2-Ethylhexyl)Phthalate Toxicity**_

Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) is an industrial additive plasticizer found in polyvinylchloride (PVC). PN administration sets and containers have been shown to be the most important source of DEHP load. Although DEHP has a rapid turnover (half-life less than 24 hours), this phthalate and its

<a id='4f30a240-46de-440f-acaa-8bb00ab41e5f'></a>

metabolites are consistently detected in human bodily fluids such as plasma and urine.74 In critically ill neonates, DEHP exposure has been shown to increase oxidative stress and toxicity.75 PN infusion sets and containers containing DEHP have been implicated as contributing to this risk. One retrospective study suggests that by changing to PVC-free infusion systems, the incidence of PN cholestasis could be reduced.75

<a id='636c08b1-a302-46ac-a936-fe594cd4fd44'></a>

**Aluminum Contamination**

Aluminum exposure is a risk in patients receiving prolonged courses of receiving PN. This nonessential trace element is found in raw materials, incorporated into products during the manufacturing process, and leached from glass containers.76 When aluminum is delivered parenterally, it bypasses the protective barrier of the GI tract. Specific findings of this toxicity include encephalopathy, impaired neurodevelopment, bone pain with development of osteopenia or osteomalacia, microcytic anemia, and cholestasis. In 2004, the FDA issued a mandate that required manufacturers to include the aluminum content on the label of additives commonly used in the compounding of PN solutions.77 The amount of aluminum provided by PN should be less than 5 µg/kg/d, the threshold deemed "safe" by the FDA.

<a id='ef88bf9f-ee19-4219-ab84-aef2782058e5'></a>

Calcium gluconate salts are a major source of aluminum contamination in PN patients. Because calcium gluconate salts are a large source of contamination, infants and children are at risk of developing toxicity because of their high calcium requirements coupled with renal immaturity. In response to the findings of potential adverse neurodevelopment associated with aluminum exposure, the use of calcium chloride in PN solutions has been reevaluated.78 Calcium chloride salts are inherently less contaminated and in theory could be used as an alternative to calcium gluconate salts. Calcium/phosphorus solubility is a major a concern, as calcium chloride salts have a higher degree of dissociation and a greater risk of precipitation.79 This risk can be minimized if calcium chloride salts are used with an organic phosphate salt; however, these organic phosphate salts are expensive and not available in many countries.

<a id='c4369b00-4d0e-41ac-93e5-fcb82b942fe6'></a>

The implementation of the FDA mandate has been difficult to incorporate into clinical practice because of limitations in current product formulations. Currently, there are few options available to reduce the aluminum load in PN solutions. One is to replace potassium phosphate with sodium phosphate salts that have considerably less aluminum. Moreover, not all ingredients (ie, heparin, albumin, insulin) added to PN solutions have a requirement for aluminum to be listed on their label, which makes it even more difficult to accurately calculate potential aluminum exposure secondary to PN use.80

# Monitoring
Monitoring the neonate's biochemical and clinical response to the initiation and continuation of PN is an essential part of patient treatment. One especially important parameter with which to assess the effectiveness of PN is weight gain. In neonates, weight and length gain along standard reference curves should be the goal for nutrition therapy, including PN. Serial measurements of head circumference and arm anthropometrics are also worthwhile to monitor. Biochemical monitoring helps to ensure tolerance to specific components of PN and may prevent many of the complications associated with this high-risk therapy. Recommended monitoring parameters are provided in Table 7-21, and Table 7-22 lists the metabolic conditions that are common among patients receiving PN, along with suggested therapeutic interventions.

**Weaning/Discontinuing PN**

When the patient is tolerating more than 50 mL/kg/d of feedings, PN should be gradually tapered off. PN may be discontinued when the infant is tolerating 100–120 mL/kg or more of enteral feedings or is receiving 25 mL/kg/d or less of PN. Taper the dextrose infusion rate to prevent rebound hypoglycemia. In comparison with older children, neonates require slower tapering with continued monitoring of blood glucose even after the PN is discontinued. ILEs may be stopped without tapering.

## Enteral Nutrition

### Human Milk

Human milk is the preferred feeding choice for all infants, especially those who are hospitalized and/or born prematurely. The short- and long-term benefits of a human milk diet for all infants are great, but increasing evidence points to the clinical benefits of human milk for hospitalized infants, sick term infants, and especially preterm VLBW infants. These benefits include lower incidences of NEC, late-onset sepsis, chronic lung disease, ROP, and neurodevelopmental impairment. 81,82 Human milk is available as "mother's own milk" (MOM), expressed from the infant's mother, or as "donor human milk" (DHM). DHM is donated, pooled, pasteurized human milk. It is important that DHM is obtained from a DHM bank to ensure appropriate screening of donors and safe handling, processing, and pasteurization of the milk. Donor milk is the recommended feeding option for VLBW infants if the maternal milk supply is inadequate or not available.83 Infants receiving DHM either as a supplement to MOM or as full feedings should be monitored closely for poor growth due to lower nutrient content, including of protein, zinc, and sodium.84 DHM is typically provided to VLBW infants with insufficient MOM until approximately 32–36 weeks' GA, when the risk of NEC is lower before transition to a preterm infant formula. 83 Challenges with achieving adequate growth and limited availability outside of the hospital should be considered if DHM is provided beyond this period.

<a id='54810ad4-ea22-4957-8e29-9b0476befd61'></a>

Human milk is a biological fluid, and contamination is a risk that must be mitigated by establishing protocols and providing education to parents and health care providers about safe practices for pumping, storing, handling, and transporting MOM and DHM.83 In addition to infectious contaminants, maternal health conditions and medications should be evaluated. Donors to human milk banks are carefully screened for health and infectious risk factors before the milk is pasteurized, which has been shown to be highly effective at removing contaminants. Specific safety protocols should also be in place for the appropriate handling, storage, transportation, and administration of DHM.13,83 The following resources help health care providers and facilities develop usage guidelines and safety protocols to meet their needs:

_Human Milk Fortification_

Although human milk is the ideal source of nutrition for neonates and infants, it does not meet the nutrition needs of most growing preterm infants. 13 Term infants with medical or surgical conditions that increase energy requirements or impact feeding and growth may require additional calories to be added to breast milk in the form of infant formula if they are unable to take a volume of human milk to meet the demand for adequate growth. 89

<a id='c86d1521-1ebc-4cb5-abf2-122617ab7e16'></a>

For preterm infants, multiple commercially sterile, multinutrient, concentrated liquid human milk fortifier (HMF) products are available, and when they are added to human milk fed at recommended volumes, they are designed to meet the nutrition needs of these infants for adequate growth, mineral accretion, and neurodevelopment. 13,84 Historically, human milk fortification involves the addition of a specific amount of fortifier to a volume of human milk, referred to as standard fortification. Because of the variable nature of human milk and ongoing struggles with optimizing growth in preterm infants, targeted and adjustable fortification strategies are being used. These consist of either adding additional protein based on serum urea nitrogen levels (adjustable) or adjusting fortification based on human milk nutrient analysis (target).90

<a id='9f3a8421-3fd7-452e-a96c-cda9b5be5a39'></a>

There are 2 categories of HMFs for preterm infants: bovine or cow's milk-based fortifiers and human milk-based fortifiers that are derived from donated human milk (Table 7-23). Preterm infants born weighing less than 1800 g should be fed fortified human milk by using commercially available multinutrient fortifier at volumes between 150 and 180 mL/kg/d to meet their nutrition needs for growth.91-93 HMF products are often used in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) for all preterm infants born at less than 34 weeks to optimize nutrition intake before transition to discharge feedings shortly before discharge, as preterm fortifier products are not commercially available outside of the hospital setting.94

Donor milk provided to preterm infants should be fortified with a multinutrient HMF product and may require increased fortification compared with MOM. 81,83 Historically, fortification was often delayed until volumes of 100 mL/kg/d or even full feedings because of fear of feeding intolerance and NEC, but there is a lack of high-quality evidence to support or refute this practice. 95-97 Earlier fortification can improve nutrient delivery during the transition from PN, which has been associated with improved growth outcomes. 98

<a id='7f978d96-a835-4b01-939c-5ccebb2d41b4'></a>

The precise feeding volume for early fortification will depend on the type of fortifier used. Cow's milk-based fortifier products should be initiated at 60–80 mL/kg/d feeding volume and may be used for preterm infants until a weight of 3.6 kg at standard feeding volumes (150–160 mL/kg/d).93,94 Above this volume, infants will need close monitoring because of the potential for excessive protein, mineral, and fat-soluble vitamin intakes. For the human milk-based fortifier, it is recommended to initiate at or

<a id='205a5acc-de1f-4ebc-9c82-5cad25a6a065'></a>

before a feeding volume of 60 mL/kg/d and continue until 34 weeks.99 Most of these infants will still require fortification with cow's milk-based HMF or preterm formula to ensure adequate growth.

# Neonatal Infant Formulas

If human milk, either MOM or DHM, is unavailable for the neonate, a broad range and selection of infant formulas are available. Standard term infant formulas, tolerance, and specialized formulas are routinely used for high-risk full-term infants and some preterm infants with specific conditions. These are reviewed in detail in chapter 5, "Enteral Nutrition." This section will review the currently available infant formulas indicated for preterm infants. Preterm infant formulas have been developed to meet the nutrition needs of growing preterm infants with consideration of their GI immaturity and specific nutrient requirements (see Tables 7-24 and 7-25). These formulas have been shown to improve weight gain and bone mineralization approaching that of the fetus when compared with preterm infants fed term formulas. 13 They are available as ready-to-feed (RTF) sterile liquids at 20, 24, and 30 kcal/oz and contain significantly higher levels of protein, minerals and vitamins compared with term infant formulas.

Preterm infant formulas are not routinely available outside of the hospital, and infants are typically transitioned to preterm discharge formulas between 34 and 36 weeks' GA. For infants with a history of osteopenia of prematurity or a prolonged course of PN, preterm infant formulas may be used to supplement mineral intake up to a weight of approximately 3.6 kg.94 Preterm infants are transitioned to preterm discharge formulas before discharge from the hospital. These formulas are enriched with protein and minerals, are standard at 22 kcal/oz, and are available as an RTF liquid and powder. Infants will require vitamin D supplementation to meet the recommended dietary allowance until taking at least 24 oz/d.95,96

# Feeding Initiation and Advancement

Initiating feedings in the neonate requires careful consideration of clinical status, medical and surgical history, GA, and developmental maturity. Coordinated suck-swallow-breathe patterns for nutritive feeding are not generally present before 32 weeks' GA. Although research has shown some infants have coordinated suck-swallow-breathe patterns at earlier GAs, successful nutritive feeding also relies on a degree of physiologic development and maturity that may vary even between infants of similar GA. The goal is to provide care that facilitates appropriate development and to identify each infant's maturational state prior to initiating oral feedings.97 Specific variables must be considered to determine an infant's oral feeding readiness:

* GA at birth
* GA at time oral feeding is considered

<a id='57d87e03-2c58-49c6-a2d1-b5f5a894c787'></a>

- Severity of illness
- Respiratory and cardiovascular stability (need for oxygen, apnea, or bradycardia events)
- Motor stability (tone, posture, quality of movement)
- Sucking, swallowing, and breathing coordination
- Temperature stability
- Alertness
- Hunger cues
- Tolerance of enteral feedings

<a id='421ebe33-eb91-4f4d-952e-10e4fce0cdce'></a>

Full-term infants may be able to initiate feedings orally by breast or bottle if their clinical status allows. If a family's goal is to breastfeed their baby, every effort should be made to work toward this goal. Many hospitalized term neonates will not be able to feed at the breast from the start of feedings because of their medical condition and required care, but by working with a multidisciplinary team, including a lactation consultant, important steps can be taken to promote the maternal milk supply and improve the chance of a successful breastfeeding outcome.98 Recommendations have been published to support breastfeeding success in late preterm and early term infants.99 Baby-Friendly USA, Inc, serves as the national authority for the WHO/United Nations Children's Fund Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative in the United States and has published 10 steps and recommendations for successful breastfeeding adapted for the NICU setting.100

Tube feedings are routinely administered in the hospitalized neonate if the infant is unable to feed orally. The gastric route, accessed by orogastric or NG feeding tubes is most common (see chapter 5, "Enteral Nutrition"). Postpyloric feeding is used less commonly and may offer some advantages in certain patients; however, this practice has not been well studied in the modern era of neonatology. 101
Feedings should be initiated as soon as the infant is medically stable to feed, ideally within 48 hours for preterm infants if clinically stable. 102

Delays initiating even trophic feeds or "minimal enteral feeding" (MEF) for preterm infants should be avoided because they may impact the infant's immature GI tract, potentially contributing to feeding intolerance, and have been associated with intestinal inflammation and an increased risk of morbidities. 103,104 Gastric route feedings may be administered by bolus or continuously on a feeding pump, and postpyloric feedings should only be administered by continuous infusion.

There are potential advantages and disadvantages of these feeding administration methods, and changes to the route and administration method may help with individual patient feeding tolerance but this has not been well studied (Table 7-26).105,106 Term and late preterm infant feedings can be initiated at 30–40 mL/kg/d and advanced by this volume daily to goal. Feedings for infants with congenital GI defects requiring surgery are typically initiated at lower volumes and advanced more slowly.107 Providing trophic feeding or MEF for a period of time prior to advancing is common for VLBW infants, typically at less than 25 mL/kg/d, but the duration is still a matter of debate.108 For moderate and very preterm infants, feeding initiation and advancement volumes have been debated in the literature, but a recent meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including over 4000 preterm infants concluded that the low volume and slow advancement of feedings (15–20 mL/kg/d) did not reduce the risk of NEC or death in very preterm or VLBW infants when compared with faster advancement (30–40 mL/kg/d).109

It is important to consider each infant's individual risk factors when determining feeding initiation and advancement. In addition, the RCT that provides most of the data for the meta-analysis did not include many ELBW infants and human milk fortification practices were not tracked, although most infants received human milk and formula. 110 Feeding tolerance should be monitored closely as feedings advance. Routine monitoring of gastric residual volumes is not recommended. Signs of or concerns about feeding intolerance should be accompanied by serial abdominal examinations and consideration of clinical signs such as apnea, bradycardia, and temperature instability. 111

**Micronutrient Requirements of the Enterally Fed Infant**
The absorption of micronutrients will be impacted by clinical conditions. For example, calcium and phosphorus absorption are influenced by postnatal age and vitamin D, lactose, and fat intake. In preterm infants, however, vitamin D may contribute little to calcium absorption.112 Suggested enteral intakes for other micronutrients are listed in Table 7-27. The appropriate enteral intake for a particular nutrient can be estimated from established rates of intrauterine accretion, plus estimation of daily losses, divided by the bioavailability (net absorption) of the nutrient.113

**Vitamin Needs**

Vitamins are supplied to the fetus via maternal transfer. Water-soluble vitamins are actively transported across the placenta throughout pregnancy, whereas the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, and E are transferred

<a id='456e3c99-cdc9-4b69-8b29-43faf09909e8'></a>

during the last trimester of pregnancy. There is negligible transfer of vitamin K.114 Human milk from mothers with adequate vitamin stores contains sufficient amounts of most vitamins apart from vitamins D and K. Thus, unsupplemented infants depend on antenatally acquired hepatic stores as well as cutaneous synthesis in response to sunlight for vitamin D and depend on synthesis by gut bacteria for vitamin K. Human milk alone does not provide infants with an adequate amount of vitamin D. Within days after birth, most infants will need an additional source of vitamin D. To avoid developing a vitamin D deficiency, the *Dietary Guidelines for Americans* and American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommend that breastfed and partially breastfed infants be supplemented with 10 µg (400 IU) per day of vitamin D beginning in the first few days of life and that this be continued until the child is fully weaned and drinking fortified milk. Table 7-28 summarizes current recommendations for enteral vitamin intake in the neonate and infant.

# Monitoring
Neonates receiving EN support require careful growth monitoring as previously described. If growth target growth rates are not achieved, the feeding plan should first be evaluated to ensure it meets recommended energy and protein requirements for the infant's size and age. Calorie and protein intakes may be increased with a higher feeding volume, further fortification of human milk, the addition of a

<a id='48ac19d7-b0f8-4c46-9c93-e3a012f1583c'></a>

calorie or protein modular, and the concentration of infant formula to 22–30 cal/oz. If the infant requires intakes greater than the typical requirements and growth remains inadequate, other factors may need to be considered, such as the underlying condition, clinical status changes, anemia, carbohydrate or fat malabsorption, medications, nutrient losses due to the feeding administration method, or electrolyte losses. 115

<a id='84ec832c-468c-44a9-b501-f0707cd2c2af'></a>

No routine biochemical monitoring is required for the enterally fed neonate, with the only exceptions being certain populations of preterm infants or those receiving medications that may impact the nutrition or electrolyte status. The AAP recommends routine evaluation of the bone mineral status for preterm infants born weighting less than 1500 g, with testing including alkaline phosphatase and serum phosphorus levels starting at 4–5 weeks of age. 116 The adequacy of the dietary intake of calcium and phosphorus should be monitored, and factors that could contribute to poor mineral intake or increased losses should be addressed. Routine monitoring of ferritin levels to assess iron status has also been recommended for VLBW infants during NICU admission. 117,118 A ferritin level of less than 35–70 µg/L requires increased iron dose to 3–4 mg/kg/d (maximum of 6 mg/kg/d) and a level of greater than 300 µg/L may warrant a decrease in iron supplementation or fortification. It should be noted that as an acute-phase reactant, ferritin is not a reliable marker of iron status during periods of acute inflammation or stress; levels will be elevated. 119

# Conclusion

The nutrition care of the neonate, whether full term or preterm, brings unique challenges during this critical period of growth and development. As advances in neonatology have led to decreased mortality rates for the preterm infant, new challenges have emerged when attempting to optimize their nutrition needs. The preterm infant is born with increased energy needs coupled with limited nutrient stores. This is further exacerbated by the physiologic demands of prematurity itself, as there are disruptions in nutrient delivery that lead to additional nutritional deficits. Evidence has shown that postnatal growth restriction, specifically a slow rate of growth during and after a NICU stay, is strongly associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes.119,120 Moreover, complications such as respiratory distress and osteopenia that are associated with prematurity can further complicate the ability to provide optimal nutrition safely. Despite these challenges, the goal is to strive to maintain intrauterine growth rates and optimize outcomes in this vulnerable population.
