## MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES

*   Check baseline electrolytes prior to start of nutrition support
    *   Replete if levels low (refer to recommendations in this module)
*   Nutrient provision
    *   10-20 kcals/kg day or 1000 kcals/day — at most
    *   In PN, limit dextrose to 100 - 150 g/day
    *   In EN, limit to 50% of total energy requireme
*   Multivitamins
    *   MVI for PN; multivitamin supplement for EN
*   Advance to goal energy intake over 3-4 days
    *   Increase by 33% of goal calories or dextrose q 1-2 days
    *   Monitor electrolyte levels daily and advance energy intakes when stabilized
*   Consider all sources of dextrose
*   Monitor weight status daily
    *   0.5 - 1 kg/weight gain per week acceptable
