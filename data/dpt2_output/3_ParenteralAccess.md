DE is a 6-year-old male who is PN dependent with a tunneled single lumen CVC. He has been readmitted with two prior bacteremias. Which of the following interventions is NOT demonstrated to reduce CRBI?

A. Chlorhexidine-impreganted sponge dressing
B. Increasing the frequency of IV lipid emulsion administration from 3 times weekly to to daily

<::A diagram illustrating a PICC (Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter) line. The diagram shows the upper torso of a human, with the heart and major veins (subclavian, jugular, superior vena cava) highlighted. A yellow catheter, labeled "PICC line enters body here" and "PICC", is shown inserted into a peripheral vein in the arm, extending upwards through the subclavian vein, and terminating in the "Heart" (specifically, the superior vena cava or right atrium). The catheter is shown with an external connector.

# TYPES OF TUNNELED LINES

*   Historical / Brand Names you may hear
    *   Groshong, Hickman, Broviac, etc.
*   Cuffed versus "cuffless"
*   Materials vary - silicone preferred for ethanol locks but there is little evidence
*   Power-injectable rated (for IV contrast injection—typically for CT scan)
*   Antimicrobial materials (coating and/or impregnation)
    *   Chlorhexidine
    *   Silver sulfadiazine / Silver ion
    *   Rifampin-Minocycline
    *   5-Fluorouracil
*   Work with your local proceduralist (may be surgeon, vascular access procedure team, etc.) to ensure product selection meets your needs

## RISK FACTORS FOR PN-CRBSI

* Subcutaneous infusion **ports instead of tunneled catheters** (P = .001)
* **Multiple lumen catheters** (P = .001)
* Increased **frequency of lipid emulsion** infusion (P = .001)
* **Drawing blood from the CVC** (P < 0.001)
* **Infusion of non-PN medications** via the CVC (P < .001)
* Increased **PN frequency** (P = .001) in children only, but not in adults.
* <u>Take-home point:</u> Minimize PN Line Access "Events”

Yellow arrows point to specific structures, which are labeled as follows: SCM (Sternocleidomastoid muscle) on the left, IJV (Internal Jugular Vein) and Carotid a. (Carotid artery) on the right. The IJV appears as a larger, more compressible, anechoic (black) structure, while the Carotid artery is a smaller, rounder, pulsatile, anechoic structure. A numerical value "4.9" is visible in the bottom right corner, likely indicating depth or a measurement. A small white circle is present in the top left corner.: ultrasound image::>

■ Alteplase to treat line clogging
<::figure: diagram::>
<::The diagram illustrates the mechanism of action of Alteplase in treating line clogging. It shows a cross-section of a vessel with a thrombus (blood clot) composed of Fibrin threads. The process is depicted in three steps:
1. Recombinant t-PA (alteplase) binds to fibrin in the thrombus.
2. This binding converts entrapped plasminogen to plasmin, a process labeled as "Activation."
3. Plasmin then "Dissolves fibrin," leading to "Fibrin degradation products," which initiates local fibrinolysis.
