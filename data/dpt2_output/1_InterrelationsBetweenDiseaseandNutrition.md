INFLAMMATION

*   Inflammation is common to diseases requiring nutrition support and predispose to malnutrition via:
    *   Anorexia, altered intake
    *   Increased nutrient losses – gastrointestinal disorders
        *   Nausea, vomiting
        *   Fistulas – abnormal communication with two or more organs
            *   Gastroduodenal – stomach to duodenum
*   Nutrient intake may be adequate but poor utilization due to:
    *   Hyper- or altered metabolism

RELATIONSHIP OF INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE AND NUTRITION
<::The visual content is a diagram illustrating the relationship between inflammatory response and nutrition.

On the left side, under "Inflammatory Response", there are two items:
- "Energy" with an orange square next to it.
- "Protein Synthesis (anabolism)"
- "Protein" with an orange square next to it.

An orange arrow points from "Inflammatory Response" to "Overall Catabolic State".

Under "Overall Catabolic State", the following points are listed:
- Favor wound healing
- Support of injury, repair
- Damage due to disease

An orange downward arrow points from "Overall Catabolic State" to "Malnutrition".

Under "Malnutrition", it states: "Catabolism >> Anabolism".

"Nutrition" is positioned centrally below "Protein Synthesis (anabolism)".

In the top right corner, there is a stylized line drawing of a human head with an intravenous (IV) drip connected. In the bottom right corner, the text "NUTRITION SUPPORT CERTIFICATE" is displayed.

# CRITICAL CARE AND SURGERY

*   Marked elevation of energy expenditure, protein catabolism and mobilization of fat for use as an energy source
    *   Predisposition to hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia and azotemia
    *   Poor tolerance to nutrition support
        *   Metabolic support – provide enough substrate to prevent nutrient deficiency or protein/calorie malnutrition until the patient stabilizes and may better utilize infused nutrients
*   Accentuated loss of LBM and shortened time to develop malnutrition

    *   Hyperglycemia - 40-90%
    *   Hypertriglyceridemia - 12-15%
    *   Hypocalcemia – present due to reduced parathyroid function, increased calcitonin levels, reduced magnesium and possibly saponification with unabsorbed free fatty acids in the GI

*   PN should be avoided and only used if EN is not feasible
    *   Persistent gastric ileus or small bowel obstruction and enteral access not possible
    *   Exacerbation of pancreatic symptoms despite nasojejunal delivery and use of elemental formula
    *   Gastrointestinal intolerance - abdominal pain, ascites, elevated pancreatic fistula output

NUTRITIONAL ISSUES

*   Need for long-term and often life-time nutrition support with parenteral nutrition or combined oral/parenteral nutrition
*   Nutrition assessment must be comprehensive with an awareness of increased probability of nutritional deficiencies
*   Transitions of care are important when patient moves between healthcare settings (hospital - home, extended care facility, or ICU - general ward, home or extended care facility to hospital or ICU)
    *   For home parenteral nutrition patients with central venous catherer infections and prolonged periods of no nutrition due to loss of venous access, electrolyte, acid-base and/or micronutrient deficiencies are likely

## CONCLUSIONS

*   Inflammation is common to all disease states which predisposes to malnutrition and impedes the response to nutrient administration
*   Individual diseases may elicit unique contributions to the development of malnutrition that require recognition and adjustments to the nutrition care plan
*   Certain conditions where nutrition may not be as beneficial and risk is high may warrant either withholding or withdrawing nutrition support

The Professor Emeritus
The Ohio State University, College of Pharmacy
Clinical Practice Specialist
American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition
Delaware, Ohio

<a id='48b8edba-1f75-4835-b65e-1ea4412ed51b'></a>

As one of the pharmacy specialist pioneers, Professor Mirtallo was
instrumental in leading cost-effective practices in parenteral nutrition and
advancing the role of the pharmacist on nutrition support services.

<a id='236abdde-d58c-4cc5-8a2a-e13d42893378'></a>

Professor Mirtallo has been very active in professional societies and is Past President of the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN). He also spent many years on the ASPEN Public Policy Committee, where he advocated for reimbursement of enteral and parenteral nutrition in the hospital and home, dealt with drug shortage issues and worked to improve the safety and efficacy of parenteral nutrition.

<a id='031b2e11-755d-4288-a3d2-9e70b3a9712e'></a>

As a representative to the Joint Commission, he served on the task force that created the Nutrition Care Standards. Mr. Mirtallo has been actively involved with nutrition support guidelines. Recently, he co-authored an etiology-based definition of malnutrition which is the basis for an inter-professional malnutrition strategy. He chaired a parenteral nutrition safety summit in the fall of 2011 which led to the development of the safety consensus recommendations released by ASPEN and the American Society for Health System Pharmacists. Currently Professor Mirtallo is Professor Emeritus at The Ohio State University, College of Pharmacy, Division of Pharmacy Practice and Administration. He is also a Clinical Practice Specialist with ASPEN.
