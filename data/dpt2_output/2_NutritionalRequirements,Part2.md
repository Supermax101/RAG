## LEARNING OBJECTIVES

*   Assess the electrolyte content of an initial parenteral nutrition formulation.
*   Recommend appropriate electrolyte content adjustments in a parenteral nutrition order, based on a given patient scenario.
*   Discuss the importance of providing the full dose of intravenous multivitamin daily in parenteral nutrition.
*   Evaluate the trace element content of a parenteral nutrition formulation.
*   Discuss the assessment timeline and potential consequences for continuing "empiric" additions or deletions of components to a parenteral nutrition formulation.

## SELF-ASSESSMENT #1

RC is a malnourished 52-year-old male with a postoperative ileus on hospital day 3. His nasogastric tube is draining 1.4 L/day and less than 100 mL out of his end descending colostomy. His laboratory results include: sodium 140 mEq/L, potassium 3.2 mEq/L, chloride 99 mEq/L, total CO2 29 mEq/L, BUN 24 mg/dL, SCr 0.9 mg/dL, magnesium 1.5 mg/dL, phosphorus 2.1 mg/dL, and ionized calcium 1.13 mmol/L. Which of the following would most likely decrease with PN initiation?

A. Sodium, Phosphorus and Calcium
B. Sodium and Potassium only
C. Potassium and Magnesium only
D. Potassium, Phosphorus and Magnesium

*   Most abnormal electrolytes need to be corrected over a chronic period
    *   3 to 7 days in most patients to replace total body stores
    *   Substantial portions (> 50%) of the electrolyte may be lost in the urine
        *   Serum concentrations approximate renal threshold
            *   Infusion may exceed the renal reabsorption threshold of the electrolyte
            *   Most are approximately 90-99% reabsorbed by kidney

A bracket connects the "8-10 PM: PN bag hung" and "4 AM: Labs drawn" events to the top rule, indicating the 6-hour hang time applies between these two points.

- Multivitamin shortages create the greatest risk for long-term PN patients
  - Minimum of 10 mL three times per week
  - Use individual vitamins if available
    - Thiamine, folic acid, cyanocobalamin
  - Oral or enteral vitamin preparations
- Trace elements concerns with commercially available multi-component products
  - Manganese toxicity with Parkinson's disease
  - Copper deposition in liver with possible Wilson's disease
  - If trace elements are removed for worsening hepatic disease
    - Reassess after 4 weeks (Serum monitoring in select patients)

## HOW TO WRITE A PN ORDER

*   Step 1 – What is your dosing weight? 60 kg
*   Step 2 – How much protein is needed? 1.5 g/kg/day
*   Step 3 – How many calories are needed? 25 kcal/kg/day
*   Step 4 – What is your volume limit? 2100 mL/day
*   Step 5 – Is the patient malnourished or NPO > 7 days? Yes
*   Step 6 – Any electrolyte disorders present? Yes
*   Step 7 – Is renal function normal? Yes
*   Step 8 – What electrolyte dosages are needed?
*   Step 9 – What other items should be added?
*   Step 10 – Can the current PN be administered peripherally or centrally?
*   Step 11 – When should the PN be advanced to goal?

    *   Stable: 0.8-1 g/kg/day
    *   Critically ill: 1.2 - 2 g/kg/day
    *   Obesity: 2-2.5 g **IBW**/kg/day
*   (1.5 g Protein/kg/day (post-operative) × 60 kg) = 90 g Protein/day
    *   (90 g Protein x 4 kcal/g) = 360 kcal/day
    *   Stock Amino Acids 10% = 10 g/100 mL = 100 g/1000 mL

▪ Daily total caloric requirement
  – (1500 kcal/day (_our selection_) – 816 kcal Dextrose/day) = 684 kcal/day
  – (684 kcal/day – 360 kcal Protein/day) = 324 kcal/day as ILE
  – (324 kcal/day ÷ 10 kcal/g (20% ILE)) = 32 g ILE/day
  – Stock 20% ILE = 20 g/100 mL
  – 32 g ILE/day = 160 mL Stock 20% ILE
▪ 816 kcal Dextrose + 360 kcal Protein + 320 kcal ILE = 1496 kcal/day
  – 25 kcal/kg/day based upon dosing weight of 60 kg

  - Use of chloride-based salts (all commercially available amino acids solutions are acetate-based)
    • Use acetate-based salts if metabolic acidosis present
• Anticipate effects of refeeding syndrome and drug-nutrient interactions based upon patient history and medication review

# CONCLUSIONS

*   Primary goal of nutrition support is to provide the required amounts of nitrogen (protein) and energy together with water, minerals, vitamins and trace elements
    *   Electrolyte requirements are dependent on patient age, renal function, drug-nutrient interactions and underlying comorbidities
        *   Oral or enteral route is preferred (if available) due to safety concerns compared to IV administration
*   Multivitamins and trace elements (e.g., Zinc, Selenium, Copper) are necessary requirements in all adult PN formulations
*   Reviewing PN orders for adequacy and efficacy are required daily
    *   Including the determination of osmolarity
