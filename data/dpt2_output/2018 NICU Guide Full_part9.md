All neonatal patients who receive procedural sedation should be monitored by a provider who has LPCH 'moderate' sedation privileges. Refer to LPCH Sedation Policy:

<a id='78f33d35-044f-4291-9ef9-b35ca2a8638b'></a>

https://intranet.lpch.org/pdf/formsPoliciesReferences/policies/hospitalWide/patientCare/sedationPolicy.pdf

<a id='2398cdaa-6e95-44ac-96e1-ab32a5b1842e'></a>

I. **Definition of Moderate Sedation:**

A drug induced depression of consciousness during which patients respond purposefully to verbal commands, either alone or accompanied by light tactile stimulation. No interventions are required to maintain a patent airway, and spontaneous ventilation is adequate. Gag reflex and other protective airway reflexes are maintained. Cardiovascular function is usually maintained. Reflex withdrawal from a painful stimulus is not considered a purposeful response.

II. **MD/AHP Credentialing and Competency Requirements**

A. Completion of a sedation teaching module. The sedation module must be completed every 4 years.
B. Successful completion of a written examination to test the knowledge of medications being given, and principles of physiologic monitoring including the interpretation of the ECG and arrhythmia recognition.
C. Must have PALS, ACLS, NRP or equivalent certification requiring training in airway management skills and cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
D. Maintenance of privileges for moderate sedation will require a minimum volume of cases per medical staff office credentialing guidelines

<a id='ef6f87ae-b03a-49f6-bc47-3edffbef37ed'></a>

### III. Procedure/Process

A. Neonatal Intensive Care Units:

1.  Any procedure which requires neuromuscular blockade or breath-holding will require the procedure to be done by the Anesthesia Team. NICU/ICN providers may not provide this level of sedation and should contact anesthesia for consultation

2.  It is nearly impossible to delineate between 'minimal' and 'moderate' sedation in a neonate, so ANY SEDATION or ANXIOLYSIS (i.e. more than 'feed and bundle') for an off-unit procedure will be considered MODERATE SEDATION for NICU/ICN patients, and therefore:

    a.  Must be provided by an MD or NNP who can intubate independently

    b.  Must be provided by an MD or NNP who has LPCH privileges for Moderate Sedation

        i.  Exception: if an MD or NNP has not performed enough sedations to grant privileges, they should still apply for Moderate Sedation privileges and may be proctored (e.g. by the NICU attending) until they reach the required number of sedations

        ii. The proctor does not need to accompany the MD or NNP providing sedation but should be available for consultation

3.  Order sets for minimal or moderate sedation may be used (type in "Sedation, Procedural")

CAPTION ERROR

<a id='a4f66746-8361-4065-9c65-866d5159a027'></a>

a. Be aware, however, that the medications in these order sets (chloral hydrate, pentobarbital, midazolam, fentanyl) may not be the medications that most NICU/ICN providers are familiar with.
b. The MD or NNP should use the medication(s) that he/she is most familiar with as a provider of sedation

4. For an _intubated_ NICU patient:
	a. Sedation that is considered part of on-going critical care does not require separate sedation consent or documentation.
	b. If a deeper level of sedation is desired for a procedure, **documentation must be completed according to the sedation policy. For cases requiring breathholding, anesthesia must be consulted. unless the procedure is such that the infant will require deep sedation or breathholding, in which case anesthesia should be consulted.**
		i. Separate consent for sedation _is_ required
		ii. Documentation: A pre-procedure sedation assessment note and a sedation procedure note should be completed. These can be found in Epic by creating a Progress Note and searching "sedation" in the SmartText box.
		iii. NPO period is highly encouraged and will be ordered at the discretion of the primary team
	c. Off-unit procedures for intubated patients require the continuous presence of a NICU provider.
	d. Sedation may be initiated prior to leaving the NICU – this is the start of the procedure
	e. Extra doses of sedation may be brought to the procedure
	f. No more than 3 total doses of each sedation medication to be given during procedure – if this is not enough to properly sedate the patient, then the procedure should be rescheduled with the Anesthesia Team.

5. For a _non-intubated_ NICU/ICN patient:
	a. Informed consent _is_ required
	b. Documentation for Moderate Sedation _is_ required.
	c. NPO period in accordance with Moderate Sedation Policy _is_ required
	d. No more than 3 total doses of each sedation medication to be given during procedure – if this is not enough to properly sedate the patient, then the procedure should be rescheduled with the Anesthesia Team

IV. **Pre-Procedure Physician, Physician's Assistant, Nurse Practitioner responsibility (both ICU and out-of- ICU procedures)**

A. Ensure there is a complete H & P exam documented as specified by hospital bylaws. Complete within 48 hours of planned sedation.
B. Establish and document a plan for sedation including level of sedation, NPO status, medications to be used,

and reason for sedation. Enter orders in the Electronic Health Record for NPO status, sedative medications,
and intravenous access if required.

C. Complete an examination of patient's airway and document this examination before sedation can be
administered.

D. Assignment and documentation of the American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Score (known as
the ASA or PS Score). Note that a consult with the Department of Anesthesia is **required** for all ASA scores of
4 or 5 prior to administering sedation, and all patients with congenital or acquired airway anomalies unless in
the NICU.

E. For a patient with unstable or poorly controlled systemic disease or organ dysfunction, obtain a consultation
with a member of 1 of the following departments or divisions as appropriate to the child's underlying disease
(Anesthesia, Critical Care, Cardiology or Neonatology).

F. Obtain informed consent for the sedation.

G. Immediately prior to administration of sedation, review the pre-sedation assessment and sedation plans, then
document this review in the EMR (complete the "Pre-Sedation Assessment" progress note template).

<a id='e337e681-71b1-4e3f-a89e-e334cea32e92'></a>

V. **American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status (PS) Classifications**

A. PS-1: A healthy patient without illness or disease

B. PS-2: A patient with localized disease or a systemic disease in good control (e.g., VSD without CHF, asymptomatic reactive airway disease, localized or systemic infection under treatment

C. PS-3: A patient with systemic disease that is not controlled (e.g., VSD with CHF, cystic fibrosis, cyanotic congenital heart disease, uncontrolled hypertension, infection with fever or sepsis)

D. PS-4: A patient with a localized or systemic disease that represents an immediate threat to life; a patient who is not expected to survive without the planned procedure (e.g., acute or end-stage organ failure, hypotension or shock, DKA, coma of any cause)

E. PS-5: A moribund patient who is not expected to survive with or without the planned procedure

F. E: Added to above classifications to designate an unplanned emergency procedure (i.e., PS-2E)

<a id='4620fd09-501d-472a-9785-859e9828c0fe'></a>

VI. **NPO Policy**

A. All patients should be NPO prior to moderate sedation.

B. **Infants >3 kg** minimum NPO requirements:
   1. >6 hrs for milk, formula, barium, contrast, etc.
   2. >4 hrs for breastmilk.
   3. >2 hrs for clear liquids.

C. **Infants <3 kg in weight** minimum NPO requirements:

Guidelines for Asymptomatic Subgaleal Hemorrhage 399

# Guidelines for Asymptomatic Subgaleal Hemorrhage

<a id='bbafb3e6-7dee-455d-8ba8-0c4ff0496955'></a>

Adam Frymoyer, M.D., Ronald S Cohen, M.D., and Arun Gupta, M.D.

<a id='8ee57ca1-7d8f-402c-9fd7-86c1b969521d'></a>

I. Background

A. Subgaleal hemorrhage (SGH) is caused by rupture of veins that run between the scalp aponeurosis and periosteum. Blood accumulates in the large potential space between the periosteum of the skull and the aponeurosis. This potential space may hold as much as 260 ml of blood and extends from the orbital ridges anteriorly to the nape of the neck posteriorly to the level of the ears laterally. The most common risk factor is a difficult vacuum or forceps extraction. SGH is a rare (~1 per 2,000 births) but potentially lethal condition. Early recognition, careful monitoring, and prompt treatment is crucial.

<a id='5030b1bb-9d61-4f31-861b-f651fd1dfc93'></a>

## II. Suggested Guidelines

### Well-Baby Nursery

A. Close monitoring and evaluation in the well-baby nursery may be suitable for an <u>asymptomatic</u> newborn with a small or suspected SGH (i.e. unclear if caput, swelling, cephalohematoma, general bruising) and a low level of clinical concern with low perceived risk.

B. A high index of suspicion and low threshold for admission to a higher level of care is warranted given the often insidious onset of clinical symptoms.

1. Signs and symptoms may be present at birth or may not become clinically apparent until several hours following delivery.

C. Considerations for Investigations / Monitoring of <u>Asymptomatic</u> Newborns in WBN

1. Inform the on-call Level II ICN Hospitalist about the newborn. This will allow for ICN team to be 'on alert' and expedite any transfer.

2. Vitals Signs - Measure vital signs every 30 min x 2 hrs then every 4 hrs for at least 24 hrs.

a. Frequency of further vitals signs can be adjusted based on clinical concern.
b. Even mild tachycardia or tachypnea can be early sign of shock and should be reason for transfer to higher level of care.

3. Check hematocrit and platelets on admit and then every 6-12 hrs x 24 hrs.

a. Frequency of further monitoring of hematocrit can be adjusted based on clinical and laboratory picture
b. Consider monitoring hematocrit for at least 48 hrs after birth based on clinical concern.

4. Measure occipitofrontal circumference (OFC) on admit and then every 4-8 hrs for at least 24 hrs.

a. Frequency of further OFC measurements can be adjusted based on clinical concern.

5. If scalp appearance concerning, hematocrit dropping, or an increase in the OFC

a. Reevaluate and adjust the level and frequency of investigations and monitoring as appropriate.
b. Consider transfer to a higher level of care.

<a id='89cd373e-04c8-4534-ac39-47fd79813300'></a>

6. Tailor monitoring and evaluation according to clinical concern and perceived risk as determined by the treating physician.

**Level II (ICN) or Level III Nursery (NICU)**

<a id='198f1172-908c-48cb-b926-b0ecc7c4b371'></a>

A. Asymptomatic newborns with a SGH may be monitored and evaluated in the Level II NICU (i.e. ICN).

B. Clinically symptomatic newborns, newborns with a rapidly evolving hemorrhage, or any other newborn with a high level of clinical concern should be managed in the Level III nursery.

1. Signs and symptoms may be present at birth or may not become clinically apparent until several hours following delivery.

C. Investigations / Monitoring for Asymptomatic Newborns in Level II/III

1. Inform Level III NICU team that newborn was admitted to level II nursery. This will allow the Level III nursery to be 'on alert' and expedite any transfer.

2. Place IV access.

3. Check hematocrit and platelets on admit and then every 4-6 hrs x 24 hrs.

a. Frequency of further monitoring of hematocrit and platelets can be adjusted based on clinical and laboratory picture

b. Hematocrit should be monitored for at least 48 hrs after birth.

4. Screening coagulation studies on admit should include fibrinogen (and platelets as defined above).

a. Further coagulation studies (i.e. INR, PTT, PTT) and timing should be based on clinical and laboratory picture.

5. Vital Signs

a. Measure vital signs every 30 min x 2 hrs then every 2 hrs x 4 hrs then every 4 hrs until 48 hrs after birth.

b. BP should be monitored at least every 4-6 hrs x 24 hrs then every 8 hrs until 48 hrs after birth.

6. Assess appearance of scalp along with infant's color and perfusion with vital signs.

7. Monitor heart rate and respiratory rate continuously via cardio/respiratory monitor.

a. Even mild tachycardia or tachypnea can be early sign of shock and should be reason for transfer to NICU.

8. Measure occipitofrontal circumference (OFC) on admit and then every 4 hrs x 24 hrs followed by every 8 hrs until 48 hrs after birth.

a. The OFC increases about 1 cm with each 40 ml of blood deposited in the subaponeurotic space.

9. If scalp appearance concerning, hematocrit dropping, or an increase in the OFC:

## Approach to Neonatal Hypotonia

<a id='b4f8b41b-a149-48cf-b552-268ddce7ffb8'></a>

## Introduction

Neonatal hypotonia is a relatively common yet often transient finding, especially in preterm infants exposed to in the presence of maternal magnesium therapy prior to delivery. Neonatal hypotonia that is more than expected for gestational age and/or persists, even if mild, requires further attention.

<a id='1c5e6189-6def-4a4e-91f7-33fa5f67768d'></a>

Identification of the cause of hypotonia allows planning of supportive therapies (e.g. tracheostomy, gastrostomy tube) or potential redirection of care. Identification of etiology also helps in genetic counseling and planning of future pregnancies (inherited causes carry a risk of recurrence). Moreover, some gene therapy and other research interventions are emerging, giving the possibility to many patients, if diagnosed early, to participate in promising clinical trials (e.g. SMA).

<a id='e682fbd1-f036-49c2-8a8c-f4e2fbaf0689'></a>

I. **Etiology of neonatal hypotonia:**

Neonatal hypotonia can be classified several ways based on the etiology. The differential diagnosis of neonatal hypotonia is broad, hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) and chromosomal disorders are reported as the most common causes (2, 3, 6). Classical division is into central (brain insult, hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, intracranial hemorrhage, metabolic encephalopathy etc.) and peripheral (anterior horn cell disease such as SMA, diseases affecting neuromuscular junction, congenital myopathies, etc.) hypotonia. In central hypotonia there are often brisk reflexes, seizures and presence of antigravity movements. In peripheral hypotonia reflexes are typically decreased or absent and there is often a lack of antigravity movements. (1-6) Central hypotonia is more common than peripheral hypotonia (3, 5).

<a id='bd44cd70-3bfe-45e9-8b59-bfbc4cc39416'></a>

The differential diagnosis of neonatal hypotonia includes following:

A. Prematurity (may be normal for gestational age or related to maternal magnesium therapy)
B. Acute perinatal event
C. Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE)
D. Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH)
E. Maternal medications (e.g. magnesium, benzodiazepines)
F. Maternal conditions (physiological effect or inherited) Myasthenia gravis, myotonic dystrophy
G. Prenatal infection: TORCH infections (suspect if hepatomegaly, thrombocytopenia, intracranial calcifications)
H. Chromosomal disorders including (diagnosis often evident on physical examination): Trisomy 21 (hypotonia very typical), Trisomy 13, Trisomy 18, other chromosomal deletion/duplication disorders
I. Other genetic syndromes including: Prader-Willi syndrome, RASopathies (e.g. Noonan, Costello)
J. Structural CNS malformations

## II. Evaluation of neonatal hypotonia

Thoughtful and thorough evaluation of a neonate with hypotonia is essential given the availability of treatment within some conditions (e.g. Pompe disease, congenital myasthenic syndromes). Clues to diagnosis can be found in family history, prenatal history, maternal medications, birth history, physical examination (often the most important for establishing diagnosis) and initial laboratory tests. Diagnostic studies are guided by careful history and examination and may include laboratory tests (e.g. CK, biochemical testing, CGH, sequencing of one or more genes), brain MRI, EEG, EMG, nerve conduction studies, muscle biopsy, ophthalmological evaluation, other subspecialty consultations. (1-6)

2.  Polyhydramnios (decreased fetal swallowing)
3.  Decreased fetal movements
4.  Fetal ultrasound results
5.  Malpresentation (often breech)
6.  Acute perinatal event? Condition of infant at the time of delivery? Fetal tracings and movements before delivery?
7.  Difficult delivery/extraction of infant? e.g. cervical spinal injury
8.  Maternal medications (magnesium, benzodiazepines)
9.  Maternal handshake: if difficulty relaxing from handshake consider myotonic dystrophy

# Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome Due to In-Utero Opioid Exposure

<a id='694dc4e8-d50c-4084-a0cf-4187b90bcb7a'></a>

Krista Birnie, M.D., Sarah Dubner, M.D., and Adam Frymoyer, M.D.

<a id='e53457f3-6392-46cc-8584-a067e32af60d'></a>

Although Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) can refer to neonatal drug withdrawal from other substances, for the purposes of this document, NAS refers to a withdrawal syndrome that occurs in newborns following in-utero opioid exposure. For guidance and considerations in newborns with in utero exposure to other substances please see the AAP Clinical Report on neonatal drug withdrawal.

<a id='5226788d-5e3a-44bf-88e8-a563c03423dc'></a>

I. **Definition**

A. A clinical diagnosis resulting from the abrupt discontinuation of prolonged fetal exposure to opioids
B. A multisystem disorder, including disturbances of the central and autonomic nervous systems and gastrointestinal tract

<a id='18620071-7cf3-4ca1-bb07-391884037a93'></a>

## II. Etiology

A. Secondary to chronic maternal use of opiates

B. Occurs in all communities and all ethnicities

C. Methadone exposure

1. Synthetic mu-opioid receptor agonist is a standard of care opioid addiction treatment for pregnant women to decrease illicit drug use and improve fetal outcomes
2. Buprenorphine is alternative to methadone treatment with comparable efficacy in pregnant and opioid-addicted mothers

D. Abuse of prescription pain medications

E. Psychotropic medications to treat depression and anxiety

1. Intrauterine exposure to SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, and benzodiazepines has been associated with neonatal symptoms, though this is different from NAS due to opioid exposure.

<a id='945ba88e-9bfa-4488-9337-3dc0d924c267'></a>

### III. Pathophysiology

A. Exact mechanism unknown, however a lack of opioids after chronic exposure causes an increased production of norepinephrine which is responsible for most of the signs of NAS

B. Opiate drugs have low molecular weight, are water soluble, and lipophilic; therefore, they easily cross from the placenta to the fetus

C. The combination of methadone with heroin or cocaine increases the permeability of methadone

D. Prolonged drug half-life in the fetus

E. The locus coeruleus of the pons is the most important part of the brain related to opioid withdrawal

F. Incidence and severity of withdrawal is less extensive in preterm neonates, proposed theories for this phenomenon include:

Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome Due to In-Utero Opiod Exposure 409

1. CNS immaturity: fewer dendritic connections exist, which is key to the action of the opiates
2. Immature livers: metabolites from maternal meds remain in body longer so effectively premature infants have a slower wean once born (vs. term infants with more mature liver/enzyme production)
3. Exposure to lower doses for shorter time periods is possible (i.e. pregnant mothers in methadone clinics often require increasing doses throughout pregnancy)
4. Decreased placental transfer rate of drug metabolites in premature infants

<a id='332e4c06-0ed2-4125-bbb3-6baf355aaf28'></a>

IV. **Clinical Presentation**

A. Symptoms of NAS following in-utero opioid exposure may vary depending on the type of substance used, the last time it was used, and whether the baby is full-term or premature.
B. Timing

<a id='2de059c7-fbdd-4019-8e12-41d657efcdab'></a>

1. Symptoms of withdrawal may begin as early as 24 to 48 hours after birth, or as late as 5 to 10 days.

D. Risk factors associated with increased risk of NAS

1. Definite: term, AGA, polydrug abuse, combination with benzodiazepines, mu-opioid receptor (OPRM1 118 AA) positive, Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT 158 AA) positive
2. Probable: male gender, methadone, smoking, combination with SSRIs

V. **Treatment Considerations for Newborns with In-utero Opioid Exposure**

A. **Patient Population**: Newborns born at >= 35 weeks at risk for neonatal abstinence syndrome admitted to newborn nursery, ICN, or NICU.

1. Infants may initially be admitted to newborn nursery unless prior Fetal Center consult noting otherwise, need for increased monitoring, or other complicating factors. A discussion with the newborn nursery admitting doctor is appropriate.

B. **Laboratory testing**: Obtain urine drug screen and meconium drug screen if not done previously. Review maternal drug screens, if available.

C. **Optimize non-pharmacological measures at all times** (e.g. to prevent or minimize onset of symptoms, not just when symptoms are apparent):

1. Room-in with mother. Prioritize these mother and infant dyads to single rooms, if possible.

2. Minimal environmental stimulation: Low noise, low lights, swaddling, prefer to keep in low activity rooms to minimize stimulation.

3. Holding by parents, as much as possible. If parents unavailable, use the help of volunteer cuddlers and swings.

4. Encourage prolonged skin to skin for optimizing neuro-behavioral aspects of the newborn

5. Pacifier use to soothe the baby if mother ok with pacifier.

6. Breastfeed ad lib frequently if no contraindications for breastfeeding.
   a. Mothers who received methadone maintenance during pregnancy and in a stable program should be encouraged to breastfeed postpartum, unless there is another contraindication, such as use of illicit drugs, HIV positive, or other concerns.

<a id='0fe13004-05ed-4a74-9f16-848feb014ce0'></a>

D. NAS withdrawal scoring using the Modified Finnegan tool (see appendix A):

1.  Timing of Scoring:
    a. All scoring should be performed half to one hour after a feed.
    b. First score should occur within 2 to 4 hours after birth/admit to provide baseline
    c. Continue scoring every 3-4 hrs
        i. If all scores < 8 for 24 hrs, may decrease frequency of scoring to every 8 hrs.
        ii. Duration of scoring will depend on specific in-utero exposure -> see 'Duration of Scoring and Observation' below.
        iii. If very low index of suspicion/concern for NAS, can start scoring at every 8 h in newborn nursery
        iv. If score ≥ 8, then increase frequency of scoring to every 3-4 hrs
        v. Note - newborn nursery cannot monitor more frequently than every 4 hrs.
2.  If two scores are ≥ 8 within a 24-hour period then the nurse is to inform the MD/NNP.
    a. Ensure all non-pharmacological measures have been optimized.

<a id='059942b6-1a52-4f78-9487-8afe6f630123'></a>

E. Duration of Scoring and Observation:

1.  Consider half-life of in-utero exposure
    a. If shorter-half life (heroin, most prescription opioids), consider 48-72 hrs of observation
    b. If longer-half life (methadone), consider monitoring for up to 5 days
    c. Earlier discharge may be appropriate if NAS scores stable, home situation stable, social worker assessment complete, and reliable follow-up plan established.
2.  If pharmacologic management (i.e. morphine) started in newborn
    a. Observe 48 hours off of morphine with NAS scores <8, prior to discharge home

<a id='76178f20-b377-4338-9fbf-80298bdd99d2'></a>

**F. Medical Management:**

1. Patients receiving medication to treat NAS will be cared for either in the ICN or NICU.

2. Medical management of NAS with morphine should be reserved for infants with NAS due to opioids, not for those with symptoms from intrauterine exposure to non-opioid substances (e.g. SSRIs).
3. Ensure all non-pharmacological measures have been optimized before starting pharmacologic management.

**a.** Consult pharmacy if IV dosing needed.

**b.** If the dose needs to be escalated more than two times in a row, consider waiting and using the average score over the next 6-12 hours before increasing again as an increased effect may occur on the same dose as morphine levels increase toward steady-state.

**c.** Some patients may require a higher dose than 0.2 mg/kg/dose (this dose is not an absolute maximum). If patient requires greater the 0.2 mg/kg/dose morphine to control symptoms, consult pharmacy and/or NICU regarding further escalation, adjunct medication (i.e. clonidine), or need for higher level of care.

**d. Example wean from stabilization dose:**
Infant weighing 3.2 kg has been on a dose of 0.32 mg (0.1 mg/kg/dose) po q3hr with NAS scores <8 for 48 hours. Dose is decreased by 10% of stabilization dose (0.01 mg/kg/dose) every 24hrs.

Day 1: 0.29 mg q3hr (0.09 mg/kg)

# Management of Hyperammonemia and Urea Cycle Defects

<a id='2089d8c0-3ecc-44de-931e-00f0484cfdc6'></a>

Greg Enns, M.D.

<a id='6d6f5334-0f99-41e7-8bf5-ee37bfe3a64f'></a>

## I. Clinical presentation

Presentation of neonatal hyperammonemia due to urea cycle defects is stereotypical. In general, infants are full-term with normal prenatal histories and appear well for the first 24 hrs. At 24-72 hrs, or occasionally days later, the infant presents with lethargy, often requiring stimulation for feeds. Other symptoms include vomiting, grunting, hyperventilation, and hypothermia. Routine labs indicate respiratory alkalosis. The diagnosis is often missed or delayed if an ammonia level is not checked.

<a id='9178cf3e-6d08-44fd-aab9-069292638833'></a>

II. **Etiologies**

There are numerous disorders that can cause neonatal hyperammonemia.

A. Urea cycle defects:
1. Argininosuccinic acid lyase deficiency
2. Argininosuccinic acid synthetase deficiency
3. Carbamyl phosphate synthase deficiency
4. N-Acetylglutamate synthase deficiency
5. Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency
6. Arginase deficiency (rarely – usually associated with later onset disease)

B. Organic acidurias:
1. 3-hydroxy-3methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency
2. Isovaleric acidemia
3. 3-Ketothiolase deficiency
4. Methylmalonic acidemia
5. Multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency
6. Propionic acidemia

C. Fatty acid oxidation defects:
1. Carnitine uptake defect
2. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 deficiency
3. Carnitine acylcarnitine translocase deficiecy
4. Long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency

5. Long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency
6. Very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency

**D.** Amino acid defects:
1. Hyperornithinemia-hyperammonemia-homocitrullinuria (HHH) syndrome
2. Lysinuric protein intolerance

**E.** Disorders of Energy Metabolism:
1. Pyruvate carboxylase deficiency
2. Mitochondrial disorders

<a id='51a41653-3ec7-4b7a-b41f-6e45f9ddc6c4'></a>

### III. Diagnostic Studies

A. Blood: send a STAT ammonia level and glucoscan every 2 hrs. Check a CMP, Mg, phos, d bili, serum amino acids (quantitative), carnitine levels (total, free, and esterified), acylcarnitine profile, and lactate levels.
B. Urine: send a routine urinalysis, urine for organic acids, urine for amino acids (quantitative), and urine orotic acid (quantitative).
C. CBC with manual differential and blood cultures.

<a id='d2c61119-b1ba-43fb-abae-7e01d0b07d32'></a>

IV. **Procedures and Consultations**

A. Place a urinary catheter.

B. Correct anemia, hypovolemia, and acidosis.

C. Intubate with a target PCO2 of 35-40.

D. Optimize glucose infusion: maintaining blood glucose 150-250 mg/dL, advancing glucose infusion to target 120 kcal/kg/day as soon as possible. This will help prevent catabolism and thereby aid in controlling hyperammonemia. An insulin drip may be required to achieve this goal.

E. Consult Genetics, Nephrology, Surgery (if Nephrology and Neonatology have decided on dialysis), and Nutrition. After a diagnosis is established then Gastroenterology should be contacted as urea cycle enzymes are located in hepatocytes, and liver transplantation offers a chance at a metabolic cure.

<a id='d96e2295-e2bc-4717-a5ac-96bab4b6c114'></a>

V. **Medications for Acute Neonatal Management of Suspected Urea Cycle Defects**

## IX. Nutrition

A. Start on TPN as soon as stable. Goal is to provide at least 100-120 kcal/kg/d. Start intralipids at 2 g/kg/d immediately after admission to prevent catabolism, advancing IL as tolerated (Discuss the addition of intralipids with Genetics before starting if there is a concern about a possible fatty acid oxidation disorder). Discuss with Genetics and Nutrition before starting and/or advancing TPN, especially when beginning amino acids. It is always preferable to use enteral nutrition as soon as possible (e.g. via a nasogastric tube), with the same target caloric goal of 100-120 kcal/kg/d.

B. After discussion with Genetics, introduce a low amount protein (e.g. 0.5 to 1.0 g/kg/day) within 12 to 24 hrs to help prevent catabolism after child has been stabilized.

I. **Introduction**

Chromosome abnormalities account for a significant portion of genetic disease and are important causes of congenital malformations and reproductive wastage. Cytogenetic disorders are found in nearly 1% of live births; thus, performing a karyotype on a newborn with multiple congenital anomalies can provide valuable information with respect to management and prognosis.

<a id='4d84196d-bcc0-4630-b86a-cad4077bd048'></a>

II. **Indications for Chromosome Analysis**

A. Chromosome analysis is indicated as a diagnostic procedure in a number of different general clinical situations such as:

1. Problems with early growth and development including FTT, developmental delay, dysmorphic facies, multiple malformations/congenital anomalies, ambiguous genitalia, cognitive disability and short stature
2. Stillbirth and neonatal death
3. Fertility problems
4. Family history (known or suspected chromosome abnormality in 1° relative)
5. Neoplasia
6. Advanced maternal age

B. For infants in the NICU, consider ordering a chromosome analysis if ≥2 of the following features are demonstrated:

1. Abnormal growth parameters
2. At least 1 major malformation
3. ≥2 minor anomalies

<a id='b0965433-530b-4e2c-bd4d-869ab032517e'></a>

### III. Determining the Appropriate Cytogenetic Test

A. Blood, routine: In most instances, a routine karyotype on peripheral whole blood is the appropriate test to be ordered. A routine analysis will provide chromosomal resolution up to the 550 band level. At this resolution, even subtle chromosomal abnormalities can be detected. This is the test to be ordered if no previous cytogenetic testing (e.g., prenatal diagnosis) has been performed, ambiguous genitalia is identified or a trisomy (e.g., Trisomy 13, 18, 21) is suspected. When ordering on EPIC, the code is "cytogenetic study, blood genetic diagnosis." Please add an appropriate ICD-10 code to the chromosome order sheet which is printed from the EPIC ordering page for billing/payment purposes. On the chromosome order sheet check "C G Blood"

B. FISH: Fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) studies are relatively new cytogenetic tests that are important adjuncts to routine chromosome analyses. The DNA probes utilized are specific for individual chromosomes and chromosomal regions. Thus, they are useful in identifying submicroscopic deletions characteristic of a number of genetic syndromes. FISH studies will typically be ordered in conjunction with routine chromosome analysis.

Genetic Testing in the NICU 421

1.  22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome: Velocardiofacial syndrome(VCF)/DiGeorge Syndrome(DGS). In the newborn period, consider this condition in infants presenting with hypocalcemia (with or without seizures), palatal abnormalities, and characteristic cardiac lesions. The latter include:
    a. Tetralogy of Fallot (22%)
    b. Interrupted aortic arch (IAA - 15%)
    c. VSD (13%)
    d. Truncus arteriosus (7%)
    e. Vascular ring (5%)
    f. ASD (3%)
    g. Aortic arch anomaly (3%)
    h. VSD; ASD (4%)
    i. Other (4%). Includes hypoplastic L heart, pulmonary valve stenosis, double-outlet right ventricle (DORV), interrupted aortic arch (IAA), bicuspid aortic valve, heterotaxy/A-V canal/IAA, transposition of great arteries, and tricuspid atresia.

    VCF and DGS are 2 names for the same region on the chromosome that is deleted and identified by FISH analysis. Historically, DGS described a group of patients with cardiac defects, immune dysfunction, and endocrine abnormalities (e.g., hypocalcemia, seizures). Sphrintzen described another group with heart defects, characteristic facies (elongated with a tubular nose), and longish fingers. VCF later described the palatal abnormalities, heart defects, and the facial features. When FISH came along, they all showed the same 22q11.2 deletion! The presentation can be extremely variable, from the most severely affected newborns with all findings to an older child with just hypernasal speech. Order chromosomes and FISH for 22q deletion (code "Cytogenetics/ FISH" in EPIC and "CGF/ VCF" on chromosome order sheet).

2.  Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a multisystem disorder with mental retardation that can be difficult to detect in the newborn period. This diagnosis is, however, suggested in infants with a prenatal history of decreased movement, abnormal fetal positioning necessitating C-section, neonatal central hypotonia, decreased or absent reflexes, poor suck, lack of waking to feed, and hypogonadism evidenced as genital hypoplasia. Neuromuscular studies will be normal. This syndrome results most commonly from a deletion on chromosome 15q. Uniparental disomy and imprinting center defects are other mechanisms. Neonatally, these babies will be very floppy and poor feeders. Males will typically have cryptorchidism. When ordering, the code is "CGF PWS on chromosome ordering sheet." NOTE: If SNRPN expression analysis is desired, be aware that ordering is through the Molecular Pathology Laboratory. Specimen requirements will be different.

3.  Williams syndrome (WMS) is due to a microdeletion of 7q11.23. It can be difficult to diagnose in the neonatal period unless a characteristic cardiac lesion is present. Supravalvar aortic stenosis and peripheral pulmonic stenosis are the 2 most common defects. Hypercalcemia can also be detected early. When ordering, the code is "CGF WMS" on chromosome ordering sheet.

<a id='ad7b358c-c9bc-41ea-9a3c-4dfc40170d8f'></a>

C. CGH: Comparative genomic hybridization is the latest test available for evaluation of a possible chromosome abnormality. It provides the most detailed examination of the genome by assessing copy number changes in a patient's sample when compared to a control sample. The latest high density, whole-genome arrays have resolutions between 3 and 35 kb. This test would be appropriate to order if there have been normal results on

422 Part II-J: Genetics
prior cytogenetic testing (e.g. amniocentesis, routine chromosomes at <550 band level) and a subtle
chromosome abnormality is suspected. When ordering, the code is "CGH GEN" on chromosome ordering
sheet.

<a id='ce6133fd-6a48-4158-a0f9-ae4bac426c0e'></a>

While CGH is a very effective tool for detecting submicroscopic chromosomal changes, there are limitations. CGH is not performed on a STAT basis and should not be ordered as such. Because abnormal results are often not straightforward with respect to interpretation, it is suggested that the test be ordered in conjunction with a Medical Genetics consultation.

<a id='0e205632-011d-4f80-9507-943011c706cd'></a>

Any questions regarding CGH should be directed to Dr. Athena Cherry (Cytogenetics Laboratory Director) at 725-6396, Dr. Melanie Manning (Assistant Cytogenetics Laboratory Director) at 725-6396 (or 723-6858) or Dana Bangs (Cytogenetics Laboratory Supervisor) at 725-7476.

<a id='586bb0b6-b5bb-48cb-ae45-5d66db1e1e74'></a>

D. If CGH is normal and/or a specific single gene disorder is not recognized, the next step to consider in the diagnostic algorithm may be whole exome sequencing (WES). WES is a diagnostic test with high sensitivity and specificity, which identifies changes in an individual's DNA that are causative of or related to their medical or developmental concerns. In contrast to current sequencing tests that analyze one gene or small groups of related genes, WES analyzes exons, or coding regions, of thousands of genes simultaneously.

<a id='072321c7-f4bb-40c9-9ce0-91122cd82cfc'></a>

A positive result from WES would likely enhance medical decision-making, impact the treatment care plan and result in significant clinical impact. If mutations are identified, targeted medical care may be recommended and other costly tests may be avoided. Additionally, many of the mutations identified by WES can have associated medical issues, which may alter long term care.

<a id='b88760ba-c6b7-45a7-bbd0-49fb370950bf'></a>

In addition to identifying genetic changes associated with a patient's features, WES may also identify mutations in genes associated with medical conditions that have medical significance for the patient or other family members. Some genetic changes, or variants, identified through WES may be of unclear clinical significance and difficult to interpret. For this reason, parental samples are typically requested to assist in interpretation of variants of unclear significance.

<a id='68e6b297-de67-47fe-bf34-d78934992f18'></a>

While WES is a very effective tool for detecting single gene changes, there are limitations. WES is not performed on a STAT basis and should not be ordered as such. Because a complex consenting process is necessary and abnormal results are often not straightforward with respect to interpretation, **it is suggested** that this test be considered _only_ in conjunction with a Medical Genetics consultation.

<a id='9a2790b7-c77a-446b-97ca-dbeb73b37adb'></a>

The family will be contacted about the WES results, and an appointment will be offered to discuss the findings in detail.

IV. **Specimen Requirements**

A. Routine specimens

Specimens for routine chromosome analysis, FISH analysis, and CGH should be collected in the following manner:

1.  Draw a minimum of 2 ml whole blood with routine venipuncture precautions.
2.  Place in green top, sodium heparin tube.
3.  Keep at room temperature.
4.  Transport sample, along with completed cytogenetic test requisition (ordering sheet) and EPIC order, to the Cytogenetics Laboratory.

<a id='d22f4476-f839-4f7c-b6f3-23d64db98f3c'></a>

**NOTE:** As most neonatal transfusions use PRBCs and not whole blood, obtaining a blood sample for cytogenetic analysis after a transfusion is acceptable and will not compromise the test outcome.

<a id='f4219e20-3caa-4c21-b803-d847f666d700'></a>

B. STAT specimens

1. STAT chromosome analysis is typically reserved for samples critical to urgent patient management decisions (e.g., initiation of support measures for chromosome abnormalities not compatible with life). STAT analysis is not performed on CGH.
2. Inform the Cytogenetics Laboratory director or supervisor when STAT status is requested.
3. Questions regarding ordering of appropriate tests or sample requirements may always be directed to the Cytogenetics Laboratory Director/Supervisor at 725-6396 or the Medical Genetics Resident on-call.

### III. Diagnosis

A medical genetics consultation is indicated in cases in which 22q11 deletion has been diagnosed.

A. Diagnosis is made through FISH (fluorescent in-situ hybridization) or array CGH, per **genetics recommendations**. See [algorithm for genetic testing in congenital heart disease](algorithm_link) to direct first steps in evaluation in the NICU.

1. The diagnosis may also be made prenatally by FISH or CGH (i.e., amniocentesis, CVS).
2. Note that cffDNA non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) "expanded panels" for microdeletions that include 22q11 are NOT diagnostic tests, and test characteristics of these expanded panels are not known. Therefore, "low risk" or "high risk" NIPT expanded panel results should NOT be considered diagnostic, and

diagnostic evaluation should be undertaken in the newborn if clinically indicated.

<a id='f65b366b-20e3-472c-8bb5-6ad13d2ae0c1'></a>

3. TUPLE1 probe for 22q11.2 region; ARSA probe for 22q13 region.

If probes are "seen", the test is "negative" for genotypic evidence of the syndrome; however, it has been estimated that ~15% of individuals with clinical features consistent with 22q11 deletion syndrome do not have deletions in the critical region.

4. Some other genetic causes have been identified, including deletions of 10p13-14 and deletions of 4p.

<a id='95876698-ba24-4448-b557-c0094a7e9f84'></a>

Trisomy 21 – Down Syndrome

<a id='ceceb617-bfbb-4fad-8582-2646af54b715'></a>

**Melanie Manning, M.D. and Gary Dahl, M.D.**

The proper management and health supervision of children with trisomy 21 or Down Syndrome (DS) is critical to ensuring the best possible outcomes for these special patients. Furthermore, families will be empowered by receiving anticipatory support and guidance, understanding the special issues that may affect their children, and recognizing the resources available. This section introduces the Center for DS at LPCH, describes major health maintenance guidelines for children with DS, and discusses Transient Myeloproliferative Disorder (TMD) and an ongoing study to follow children with DS.

<a id='e8fb1e9f-6ed3-4672-9438-9405ab396447'></a>

I. **General Health Supervision for Infants with DS**

The following recommendations are in keeping with the AAP and National DS Congress health supervision guidelines for patients with DS. All babies with or suspected of having DS should have the following evaluations after birth:

A. Routine blood karyotype. May be ordered STAT. Prenatal diagnosis by non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) should be confirmed by karyotype. If the patient's mother has had diagnostic prenatal testing (amniocentesis or CVS) that identified trisomy 21, no need to repeat. No need to order high resolution karytoype!

B. CBC with differential

C. Echocardiogram

D. Hearing screen (Routine, prior to discharge.)

E. Newborn screen (Will detect congenital hypothyroidism).

F. Monitor for intestinal obstruction

G. Genetics consult (This will assure the patient is scheduled in the Down Syndrome Clinic for their 1st developmental assessment.)

* Any questions regarding these recommendations may be directed to Melanie Manning, MD or the Medical Genetics Resident on-call.

<a id='e47928fd-db49-473f-998c-98924a15aa55'></a>

II. **Center for DS:**
The Center for DS is a multi-disciplinary clinic devoted to the evaluation and care of children with DS. LPCH is one of the few children's hospitals in the nation to offer these much needed services to children. The mission of the Center for DS is to help each child with DS reach his or her full potential and function as independently as possible in all aspects of school and family life. The clinic is directed by Dr. Melanie Manning, Clinical Associate Professor of Pediatrics and Pathology in the Divisions of Medical Genetics and Cytogenetics at LPCH. She has over 10 years' experience in the care and evaluation of children with disabilities. She has particular interest and expertise in children and adults with chromosome abnormalities.

<a id='421bf6d8-570f-487e-83cb-5b10e3beb770'></a>

A. Patient care

The Clinic is staffed by a dedicated team of specialists that includes: clinical geneticists, genetic counselors, nutritionists, as well as speech language, physical, and occupational therapists. Social workers are available as needed. The team is focused on the prevention and early detection of the medical and developmental issues associated with DS. The clinic staff will work with each child's primary care physician to provide the coordination necessary for the many services needed by these children, educate parents so that they can

become strong advocates for their children, and assist them to locate resources in their community.

<a id='8bf2affc-2f0b-42b6-8aac-57b7cc0376eb'></a>

B. Each patient will receive the following services:

1. Comprehensive medical and genetics evaluation
2. Speech and Language pathology consultation
3. Physical therapy consultation
4. Occupational therapy consultation
5. Nutrition consultation
6. Referrals as required to other sub-specialists and ancillary services
7. Regular and/or continuing follow-up care (to be assessed and coordinated with primary care physicians and families based on individual needs)

<a id='3c4ba948-4930-4dea-a754-b3068304bf74'></a>

C. Referral information

For neonatal inpatients with DS or suspected DS, an inpatient consultation is strongly recommended. An appointment in the Center for Down Syndrome should occur after discharge at ~4 months of age.

To make an outpatient referral, call the Medical Genetics office for referral instructions at 723-6858. Additional questions may be directed to the clinic coordinator.

D. Clinic Hours and Location

Clinics are held 2 Friday afternoons per month from 1-5:00 pm at the Mary L. Johnson Pediatric Ambulatory Care Center.

<a id='a3a61439-8d78-4912-9d01-4e6a8ce3e2ba'></a>

### III. Transient Myeloproliferative Disorder (TMD) and DS

**A.** Background: TMD is an uncontrolled proliferation of myeloblasts occurring only in infants with DS. The majority of infants present from birth to 2-3 wks of life with elevated WBCs and blasts on a CBC with differential, very rarely with anemia or thrombocytopenia.

**B.** The incidence of TMD in DS has been estimated at 10%, based on a single small prospective observational study. Most cases of TMD are asymptomatic and detected with surveillance CBC with differential, with spontaneous resolution by 3 mos of age. Twenty percent of cases progress to life-threatening organomegaly, hepatic fibrosis, liver failure or cardiopulmonary disease (due to blast infiltration). Thirty percent of all cases develop acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) between the ages of 1 and 4. Development of AMKL has no relationship to the severity of presentation of TMD.

**C.** If TMD is diagnosed in a DS neonate, these infants are monitored inpatient with CBC with differential, and may be discharged once the total WBC and blasts consistently decline. A Pediatric Oncology attending follows the patient as a consulting service. Treatment of TMD is considered if evidence of cardiopulmonary compromise or liver failure occurs or if blast count exceeds 100,000. Treatment is low dose cytarabine given subcutaneously every 7 days.

**D.** All TMD patients, regardless of severity, are routinely followed in Pediatric Oncology Clinic monthly for 1 yr, then every 3 mos until 4 yrs old.

Newborn Screening

<a id='64b587cc-e54f-4986-8033-3f0a2ca393f5'></a>

**Janet Stolowitz, R.N., Parnaz Abidi, R.N.**

---

State regulations require newborn screening via blood testing for phenylketonuria, galactosemia, primary congenital hypothyroidism, metabolic disorders, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, hemoglobinopathies, biotinidase deficiency, cystic fibrosis and severe combined immunodeficiency. Questions should be addressed to Janet Stolowitz, RN at (650) 724-8120.

<a id='976ca3b2-51be-4830-991b-33a78bf78392'></a>

I. Timing of Specimen Collection

A. Regulations require testing prior to transfusion, on the 4th day of life, or as close to discharge as possible for infants discharged prior to 6 days. This specimen collection shall occur after 12 hours but no later than 96 hours of age prior to discharge or transfer of the newborn unless the newborn's condition is life-threatening and the collection cannot be done safely.

B. In healthy term infants, testing should **not** be done prior to 12 hrs of age. The optimal age for testing is 24-48 hrs of life.

C. In infants who receive a red blood cell transfusion prior to 12 hrs of life, a newborn screen (NBS) should be done prior to transfusion and then repeated no sooner than 24 hours after transfusion. The pre-transfusion specimen will provide valid results for hemoglobin pattern and galactosemia. If a newborn screen was not collected prior to transfusion, recall Hb pattern testing, done via DNA testing of the baby's white blood cells, can be done. It is optional but highly recommended. This testing is arranged through the NBS program. The medical and nursing staff should be aware of the signs and symptoms of galactosemia as a red blood cell transfusion prior to NBS collection invalidates the screen for galactosemia.

D. If the baby was started on ECMO or received a complete exchange transfusion prior to 12 hrs of life, you must wait 48 hrs post-RBC transfusion before collecting the 2nd NBS.

E. If the baby receives an RBC transfusion after 12 hrs of life, the NBS collected prior to RBC transfusion is adequate.

F. If born at LPCH and NBS is pending or completed, do not resend NBS.

1. Pending specimens can be identified by opening the patient's file in EPIC and clicking on the "Results Review" tab, and then clicking on the "chemistry section of lab results" tab in that window. If there is a newborn screen pending, it will be listed on the date it was sent.

G. A newborn screen does not need to be done on infants who meet the following criteria:

1. Admitted to LPCH at more than 48 hours of age and previously discharged home. Check with EPIC to make sure NBS has been done.

2. Newborn screen performed elsewhere (documented by a copy of NBS specimen submission form or results, by checking with NBS Area Service Center at (650) 724-8120, or by parent report if infant has been previously discharged from another hospital).

3. The admitting MD/NNP must select the MD to RN Communication on EPIC admission labs that instruct the nurse that a NBS does not need to be done.

H. Newborn screens should be sent for any unscreened infant who is to be sent to the OR, Cath Lab or transferred out of the NICU.

<a id='a0eb74d0-3e95-4929-be4d-4ad77bdf3c94'></a>

I. If a NBS was not obtained prior to an RBC transfusion the following testing should be performed:

1. Hemoglobin pattern testing (DNA testing of the baby's white blood cells) is available through NBS. This can be done at **any time** and is free of charge. You can contact Joann Matouk, RN, Joan Luthra, RN or Marianne Varley, RN, to arrange for testing.
2. Galactosemia: the galactosemia results are invalid if the baby received a RBC transfusion prior (See Section IV) NBS collection. We recommend that the staff be aware of the signs and symptoms of galactosemia. If galactosemia is suspected, a metabolic specialist should be contacted immediately to arrange for evaluation and testing. In this situation, Newborn Screening does not recommend repeat NBS testing for 3 months post-RBC transfusion. Otherwise repeat NBS testing is recommended 3 months post RBC transfusion.

<a id='8804e639-b7cb-446c-b6cf-e39f6a13d4e2'></a>

J. If prior specimens have been resulted as "inadequate for testing", a repeat specimen **must** be sent. Do not send more specimens in response to a report that indicates that "no interpretation is possible due to transfusion"; a new specimen will produce the same result. If there was a specimen obtained on that baby before transfusion, the results for hemoglobinopathy and galactosemia screening are valid, and no additional testing is indicated.

<a id='75435d63-8478-406f-bee5-39913ac33ec5'></a>

II. **Results Notification**

A. For babies in the NICU, nursery staff will be notified of recall results by telephone.
B. Recall result letters are sent to the physician of record; the doctor whose name is written in on the NBS form.
C. Copies of the recall result letters are also sent to the Clinical Laboratory.
D. Families are to be notified of the results by the NICU physician or their Primary Health Care provider.
E. The primary Physician, Resident or Nurse Practitioner can call for results if not entered into the computer at (650) 724-8120 and must state that the infant is still hospitalized in the NICU. All requests for newborn screening need to have a Lookup Request form filled out and faxed; the Newborn Screening Office will fax the result right away, or, more often, will call to confirm by phone.

<a id='db20221e-0df0-431b-8ad5-0de14b00c53e'></a>

### III. Transfusion

A. Blood transfusion with red blood cells, whole blood, and packed red blood cells, including procedures such as intrauterine transfusions, exchange transfusions and ECMO, will invalidate newborn screening for hemoglobinopathies and galactosemia; therefore, you must check "YES" transfusion on the Newborn Screening form and write the date and time of transfusion.

B. Transfusions with plasma, albumin or platelets will not invalidate newborn screening for hemoglobinopathies and galactosemia and you should check "NO" transfusion on the Newborn Screening form. Do not write in date of platelet, FFP or albumin transfusion. If there are any markings other than "NO," it will confuse the State system and assumed that the baby received an RBC transfusion.

C. Please see section I.I above for details about repeating the NBS if a PRBC transfusion given.

<a id='813b5222-1499-4ff4-a2bb-a2d01fd93f8b'></a>

IV. **Galactosemia**

A. Galactosemia should be suspected when signs and symptoms such as sepsis (often E. coli), vomiting, lethargy, failure to thrive, non-specific neurologic symptoms, jaundice, hepatomegaly or hepatic dysfunction, milk intolerance or absent red reflex are present.

434 Part II-J: Genetics

B. First check a urine specimen for reducing substances (Clinitest®), and, if positive, excluding glucose with a glucose oxidase test (Labstix®), then check urine for galactose. False positives can be caused by vitamin C and medications such as tetracycline, chloromycetin, and streptomycin. If the infant is receiving lactose feedings, the blood may be analyzed for quantitative transferase to see if it is consistent with the heterozygous carrier state. These tests are available from the Biochemistry Lab at Children's Hospital of Los Angeles at 323-669-2271.

C. Galactosemia can also be ruled out by carrier testing of the parents. This is available from ARUP Labs in Salt Lake City, Utah. Contact the Newborn Screening Program to arrange for testing at 724-8120.

<a id='560f27be-3ac7-423c-9583-19956ee369df'></a>

V. **Hemoglobinopathy**

Hemoglobinopathy can be ruled out by carrier testing of the parents. This is available from the Hemoglobinopathy Lab at Children's Hospital Oakland. Contact the Newborn Screening Program to arrange for testing at 724-8120.

<a id='1b8fbd77-6a1f-46a3-943a-3cd92f6beb0c'></a>

VI. **Thyroid**

If results for thyroid screening come back with an increased TSH level, the recommendations are to obtain free T4 and TSH level on venous blood and consult Endocrinology. Results must be sent back to NBS.

<a id='d2105f33-9467-4639-9a1e-e9efc40c9d0c'></a>

## VII. SCID

A. Specimen is tested for T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) in DNA extracted from dried blood spots using PCR. Initial results are deemed positive, incomplete or negative.

B. An incomplete result must be followed up with a repeat NBS. If the repeat NBS is also incomplete it will be considered positive and must be followed up with the testing listed below.

C. A positive test followed up with confirmatory testing of CBC differential and lymphocyte subset analysis by flow cytometry performed on a whole blood specimen. The testing done through Quest labs and is interpreted by Jennifer Puck, MD, Department of Immunology at UCSF. A nurse coordinator from the Newborn Screening Program will advise as to the appropriate testing to be done and will fax appropriate paperwork regarding testing.

VIII. **<ins>Tandem Mass Spectrometry (MS/MS) for inborn errors of metabolism</ins>**

The NBS Nurse Coordinator will advise a NICU clinician of the abnormal results. Abnormal MS/MS results require an immediate referral to LPCH Medical Genetics. The NBS Nurse Coordinator will make the referral and then medical genetics will contact the NICU to advise of confirmatory labs to be done through Quest Diagnostics.

<a id='15c357cc-e789-4569-bde1-6ffe6943c5f7'></a>

IX. **Cystic Fibrosis**

Pierre Robin Syndrome/Sequence

<a id='d0760cf4-9bad-4aaa-b400-0ec76a305627'></a>

Elena Hopkins, R.N., M.S., P.N.P.

<a id='76ed11e7-2a80-4f89-a726-d419d90bd2a3'></a>

I. **Pierre Robin Syndrome/Sequence**

A. **Findings, Causes, Incidence and Risk factors**

1. Pierre Robin Sequence [PRS] is a condition present at birth, which involves the triad of micrognathia, glossoptosis, and cleft palate [CP].
2. Incidence ranging from 1 in 8,500 to 1 in 14,000 live births.
3. The exact cause of Pierre Robin sequence is unknown and may be isolated or a part of a genetic syndrome.
4. The lower jaw develops slowly before birth, but speeds up during the first year of life.
5. PRS puts infant at risk for repeated ear infections, choking episodes, aspiration and hypoxia related to airway obstruction.

B. **Most common associated genetic causes**

1. **Stickler syndrome**: (hereditary progressive arthro-ophthalmopathy). A group of genetic disorders affecting connective tissue, specifically collagen. Stickler syndrome is a subtype of collagenopathy, types II and XI. Stickler syndrome is characterized by distinctive facial abnormalities, ocular problems, hearing loss, and joint problems.
2. **Velocardiofacial syndrome**: The features of this syndrome vary widely, even among members of the same family, and affect many parts of the body. Characteristic associated defects include congenital heart disease, defects in the palate related to neuromuscular problems with closure (velo-pharyngeal insufficiency), learning disabilities, mild differences in facial features, and recurrent infections.
3. **Fetal alcohol syndrome**: A pattern of mental and physical defects that can develop in a fetus in association with high levels of alcohol consumption during pregnancy.
4. **Treacher Collins syndrome**. An autosomal dominant congenital disorder characterized by craniofacial deformities. Treacher Collins syndrome is found in about 1 in 50,000 births. The typical physical features include downward slanting eyes, micrognathia, conductive hearing loss, underdeveloped zygoma, drooping part of the lateral lower eyelids, and malformed or absent ears.

C. **Clinical management**

1. Infants with this condition should NOT be put on their back. The goal is to prevent the tongue from falling back into the airway. PRS is one of the named exceptions to the recommended supine position in the "Back to Sleep" campaign. Best position is elevated prone or side lying.
2. Feeding must be done very carefully to avoid choking and aspiration. Many of these patients need a nasogastric tube and consistent involvement of a feeding specialist.
3. Infant must remain on a cardiorespiratory monitor and oxygen saturation monitor until defined stable.

I. **National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Cooperative Multi-center Network of Neonatal Intensive Care Units**

Modern neonatal medicine is a rapidly developing, highly technical environment in which principles of management and innovative methodologies change rapidly, before rigorously controlled studies of their safety and efficacy can be conducted. In 1982, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) reviewed the need for better studies of the management of infants in Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) and recommended that cooperative, multi-institutional medical studies be conducted. A cooperative multi-center network of NICUs was established in 1986, thus providing a large population in which questions could be answered more rapidly using common protocols than by individual centers acting alone. In 1991, the original mission was expanded to include observational studies designed to assess the consequences of disease, procedures, and therapeutic interventions, as well as to generate hypotheses concerning future treatment strategies, and follow-up studies designed to elucidate unique physiologic, developmental, and social risks of its study populations. Activities in the past include protocols investigating:

* The efficacy of one exogenous surfactant versus another in the treatment of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS)
* Antenatal use of phenobarbital in the prevention of intraventricular hemorrhage
* Steroids for bronchopulmonary dysplasia
* Prediction of jaundice in term infants
* Accuracy of the revised Ballard exam in the assessment of gestational age
* Vitamin A in the prevention of chronic lung disease
* Indomethacin prophylaxis for IVH among pre-term infants
* Whole body cooling for infants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy
* Neurodevelopmental outcomes of extremely low birth weight infants exposed to aggressive versus conservative phototherapy
* Efficacy of inhaled nitric oxide in the treatment of term infants and pre-term infants with hypoxic respiratory failure
* Target ranges of oxygen saturation in extremely preterm infants
* Early CPAP versus surfactant in extremely preterm infants

### III. Pediatric Trials Network (PTN)

Sponsored by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), the Pediatric Trials Network (PTN) is an alliance of clinical research sites located around the United States that are cooperating in the design and conduct of pediatric clinical trials to improve health care for the youngest patients. Children are not simply "little adults" who respond to drugs according to scale. Rather, developing organs and changes in metabolism throughout infancy and childhood affect how drugs are processed by immature or maturing bodies. Thus, special care must be taken in tailoring the use of medicines in this unique and vulnerable population. Unfortunately, only a small percentage of drugs and devices approved by the Food and Drug Administration are actually labeled for pediatric use. Pediatricians, consequently, are often forced to prescribe medical therapies "off-label," or according to their best guess based on adult studies.

To fill this troubling information gap, the PTN is studying the formulation, dosing, efficacy, and safety of drugs, as well as the development of medical devices, used in pediatric patients. In keeping with the goals of the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, data collected from PTN trials will help regulators to revise drug labels for safer and more effective use in infants and children.

The purpose of the Generic Data Base (GDB) is to create a registry of baseline and outcome characteristics for
high-risk pre-term infants (gestational ages ≥22 to <29 weeks or birth weight 401-1,000 g or enrolled in a NRN trial)
based on data collected uniformly in neonatal intensive care units at institutions participating in the NRN. These

data, although not representative of a regional sample, do represent a number of major academic tertiary care
centers, exemplifying the neonatal morbidity problems of the present day. The GDB offers a unique tool with which
to conduct observational studies designed to assess the consequences of disease, procedures, and therapeutic
interventions, as well as to generate hypotheses concerning future treatment strategies and specialized follow-up
studies designed to elucidate unique physiologic, developmental, and social risks of the study population.
Beginning in September 2017 a secondary study of intrapartum stillbirth will be included in the GDB and continue
for 5 years. This will permit a comprehensive comparison of NRN extremely preterm birth outcomes around the
world and provide baseline data for intrapartum stillbirths to inform future clinical trials of perinatal interventions for
extremely preterm infants. (NICHD)

Follow-up of High Risk Infants
Susan Hintz, MD, MS Epi and Krisa Van Meurs, MD

<a id='cd3fd6f7-6418-4f58-a035-390e4a1e1e1c'></a>

This study is a follow-up evaluation of all infants born before 27 weeks of gestation who are part of the GDB or who are enrolled in a NRN trial with a follow-up component. Linking information from the GDB to a follow-up assessment at 18 months provides a unique opportunity to address health policy debates as well as evaluate the impact of care practices. At 18-22 months corrected age, based on best obstetric estimate, participating infants undergo an evaluation that includes demographic and medical history, physical and neurological examination, Bayley Scales of Infant Development III (neurodevelopmental and behavioral assessment), and CBCL (Child Behavior Checklist). This study is conducted in the Mary L. Johnson Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics Program. (NICHD)

The primary hypothesis of this trial is that the risk of death or moderate to severe disability at 18-22 months will be decreased in infants 33 0/7-35 6/7 weeks postmenstrual age and ≥1500 grams birth weight with moderate or severe neonatal encephalopathy at <6 hours of age who undergo targeted temperature management with whole body hypothermia to 33.5°C (esophageal temperature) for 72 hours compared to those with core temperature targeted at 37.0°C (controls).

A Randomized Controlled Trial of the Effect of Hydrocortisone on Survival without Bronchopulmonary
Dysplasia and on Neurodevelopmental Outcomes at 18-22 Months of Age in Intubated Infants <30 Weeks
Gestational Age

Krisa Van Meurs, MD and Valerie Chock, MD, MS Epi

<a id='1aa9b07e-c6ae-4df3-8441-09eafebb22cf'></a>

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) continues to be a leading morbidity of the extremely preterm infant. Dexamethasone has been used in the past to facilitate weaning infants off of ventilators and decrease the incidence of BPD. However, due to adverse effects on neurodevelopmental outcomes, the use of dexamethasone has decreased. One cohort study suggests that hydrocortisone also facilitates weaning off ventilators. Hydrocortisone has not been associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in either cohort studies or randomized controlled trials to date. A recent meta-analysis of postnatal corticosteroid therapy started after the first week of life suggests that, "late therapy may reduce neonatal mortality without significantly increasing the risk of adverse long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes." This study will determine whether, compared to placebo, a 10 day course of hydrocortisone given to infants born before 30 weeks of gestation who remain on ventilators at 14-28 days postnatal age will significantly improve their rate of survival without moderate or severe BPD and will be associated with improvement in survival without moderate or severe neurodevelopmental impairment at 18-22 months corrected age.
