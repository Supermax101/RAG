MALNUTRITION: NOT A NEW ISSUE

Example:
- 1936 Publication "Percentage of Weight
Loss: Basic Indicator of Surgical Risk in
Patients with Chronic Peptic Ulcer".

<::A black and white photograph shows a group of medical professionals, likely surgeons and nurses, in an operating room. They are all wearing surgical gowns, caps, and masks, gathered around a patient lying on an operating table. One older male doctor on the right is holding an instrument near the patient. The room appears to be a hospital operating theater from an earlier era, possibly the 1930s, with medical equipment visible in the background.

<::Economic Burden

  Hospital stays involving malnutrition accounted for
  "$42 billion"

<::Human Cost
  Icon: Three stylized human figures
  Most malnutrition-related stays have a substantially higher proportion of in-hospital deaths
  "1.5x to 5x higher" than those unrelated to malnutrition

<::Longer Hospital Stays
  Icon: Hospital building
  Most hospital stays were "2x longer"
  "47%-71%" of patients with malnutrition did not have a routine discharge

* Body down-regulates albumin synthesis so that needed proteins for immune, clotting, and wound healing functions can be made
* Positive - antibodies, complement, C-reactive protein, and fibrinogen
* Negative - albumin, transferrin, prealbumin, retinol binding protein
* Malnourished individuals (pure semi-starvation) likely will exhibit normal visceral proteins (anorexia nervosa)
* Any degree of inflammation will down-regulate visceral protein synthesis
  * Infection, obesity, surgical stress, chronic inflammatory disease, malignancy, etc

## MALNUTRITION ASSESSMENT PROCESS

*   Perform nutrition screen
*   If positive screen, refer to nutrition clinician
*   Assess for the presence of inflammation
*   Determine etiology of potential malnutrition
*   Assess for presence of two malnutrition characteristics
*   Is the patient malnourished?
*   If yes, determine severity via thresholds of specific characteristics
