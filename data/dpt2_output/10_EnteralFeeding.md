*   Wierdsma et al. Crit Care 2011 (pilot study)
    *   Validate the diagnostic accuracy of fecal weight as a biomarker for fecal loss
    *   Assess fecal macronutrient contents
    *   Stool from 48 patients analyzed
        *   10 with >350 grams/day; 38 with <350 grams/day
    *   More than 350 grams/day feces was statistically significantly associated with an energy-absorption coefficient of less than 85%

# FIBER AND DIARRHEA

*   Multiple small studies have demonstrated improvement in diarrhea
*   Meta-analysis of aggregated data (over 400 subjects) in 17 studies
    *   No difference in diarrhea in ICU patients receiving dietary fiber
    *   Reduced diarrhea in non-ICU patients receiving dietary fiber
*   Short chain fructo-oligo saccharides may contribute to diarrhea (FODMAP's)
    *   Especially in those receiving antibiotics impacting intestinal microbiota
    *   Highly osmotic

    *   Directly acts on the circular and longitudinal muscles of the intestinal wall to slow motility
    *   Inhibits fluid and electrolyte secretion and/or increase water absorption
    *   2–4 mg for each loose stool (or four times daily)
    *   Max of 16 mg/day

    *   Maximum of 20 mg/day
    *   Discontinue with clinical improvement
*   Tincture of Opium
    *   Inhibits peristalsis through opioid receptor stimulation in the GI tract

    *   Dependent on residue and absorption of enteral formula
*   Clinical definition

*   Causes
    *   Dehydration
    *   Inadequate or excessive dietary fiber

*   May need additional fluid to facilitate regular stool output
    *   Minimum of 1 mL fluid per enteral calorie intake
*   Incidence in critically ill patients
    *   Observational study in 106 ICU patients (>3 days admission)

## ASPIRATION AND ENTERAL FEEDINGS

*   Aspiration is the inhalation of material into the airway
*   Assumption that pneumonia can develop from aspiration of enteral feeding
*   Relationship between enteral feedings and aspiration is associative
*   Progression from aspiration to pneumonia depends on the quantity and the acidity of the formula
*   Aspiration pneumonia may account for 5% to 15% of pneumonia in hospitalized patients
*   Incidence of gastric contents in tracheal secretions: 22% to 31%
