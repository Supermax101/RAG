I. INTRODUCTION

A. **Purpose:** To provide guidance in the assessment, surveillance, and provision of parenteral nutrition to adult patients.

B. **Definition of Terms:** Parenteral Nutrition (PN) refers to both Central Parenteral Nutrition (CPN) and Peripheral Parenteral Nutrition (PPN). Central Parenteral Nutrition is also called Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN).

   1. PN is the intravenous mode of nutrition support therapy that bypasses the gastrointestinal tract altogether. PN is available in a three-in-one (3-in-1) or two-in-one (2-in-1) solution. The 3-in-1 solution includes an infusion of total nutrient admixtures (dextrose, amino acids, and fat emulsion) from one container. The 2-in-1 solution is the infusion of dextrose and amino acids with the fat emulsion infused separately. Currently, the use of PN at SHC is limited to 2-in-1 solutions.

C. **Indications:** The evaluation of indications and contraindications should be conducted prior to PN initiation. The benefits of initiating PN therapy should outweigh the risks of developing PN-associated complications. To optimize the potential for improvements in nutrition outcomes and to reduce the risk of developing PN-associated complications, the use of PN should be reserved for patients who do not have a functional gastrointestinal tract, are not candidates for enteral nutrition, and require at least one week of nutrition support.

   1. Clinical settings where PN is likely indicated:
      a) Anastomotic leak/bowel perforation/GI discontinuity
      b) Bowel obstruction
      c) Distal high output enterocutaneous fistula
      d) Failed trial of enteral nutrition
      e) High output chylous leak
      f) High risk for bowel ischemia
      g) Ileus
      h) Inability to obtain enteral access
      i) Intolerance to PO/enteral nutrition

j) Intractable vomiting or diarrhea
k) Massive small bowel resection
l) Peritonitis
m) Primary team preference
n) Requiring supplemental PN to meet full nutritional needs
o) Severe malabsorption
p) Severe mucositis
q) Slow post-operative PO/EN advancement

<a id='61399d3f-5a01-422c-b494-76dd5e42c1d7'></a>

2. Clinical setting where PN is contraindicated:
a) There is a functional and accessible gastrointestinal tract.
b) The use of PN is anticipated to be less than five days.
c) When aggressive nutrition support is not warranted by the patient's wishes or prognosis.

<a id='83889d23-dacf-48e4-b459-4957235746cf'></a>

D. Considerations:
1. Do not use PN solely to treat poor oral intake and/or cachexia associated with advanced malignancy.
2. Evaluate clinical factors and performance status when selecting candidates for PN at the end of life.
3. Limit the use of PN in palliative care to appropriate candidates with an expected survival of at least 2-3 months in the absence of nutrition support, for whom oral intake or enteral nutrition (EN) is not feasible.
4. Define criteria for discontinuing PN depending on the patient's goals of care; consider stopping PN when the burdens and risks of PN outweigh potential benefits.
5. Time Frame for Initiating PN:
   a) PPN is indicated in 2 situations: as a bridge therapy to TPN when central access cannot be obtained immediately or for short-term use when PPN is needed for 5-14 days. PPN should not be initiated if needed for less than 5 days with no plans of starting TPN.
   b) Delay the initiation of PN in a patient with severe metabolic instability until the patient's condition has improved. Conditions warranting cautious initiation of PN are below, however, PN can be ordered for a 9 pm start if the below conditions can be improved prior to the hang time. Achieving ideal metabolic conditions should not delay the start of PN as long as metabolic derangement is not severe.
      (1) Hyperglycemia: Glucose greater than 180 mg/dL
      (2) Azotemia: Blood urea nitrogen greater than 100 mg/dL
      (3) Hypertriglyceridemia: Serum triglycerides greater than 200 mg/dL

II. PARENTERAL NUTRITION ACCESS

A. Please refer to the following procedure in the Patient Care Manual for more information: Intravenous Infusion - Parenteral Nutrition – TPN, PPN, Lipid Emulsion Infusion found at [Parenteral Nutrition – TPN, PPN, Lipid Emulsion Intravenous Infusion](Parenteral Nutrition – TPN, PPN, Lipid Emulsion Intravenous Infusion)

<a id='4e442de5-eed5-4eec-a030-f05eac1c9469'></a>

### III. NUTRITIONAL REQUIREMENTS

A. **Caloric Requirements:** The Registered Dietitian determines the appropriate energy goal based on various factors, including age, gender, height, weight, activity level, respiratory status, temperature, clinical status, and functional status.

1.  In general, ASPEN guidelines recommend a range of 20 to 35 kcals/kg when calculating initial needs using actual body weight (when actual is <120% IBW). Adjustments can then be made based on the patient's clinical response and medical condition.
2.  Indirect Calorimetry (IC) is considered the gold standard for determining metabolic rate. When properly performed, it provides the most accurate and reproducible metabolic rate values. For more information, please refer to the Indirect Calorimetry Coordination policy found at https://stanfordhealthcare.policytech.com/docview/?docid=6890

B. **Carbohydrate Requirements:** The minimum recommended amount is 100 grams of carbohydrates for adults per day to help suppress lipolysis, ketone production, and protein catabolism.

1.  Dextrose provides 3.4 kilocalories/g. To minimize adverse metabolic consequences (e.g., hyperglycemia, lipogenesis, and fatty liver infiltration), the

infusion of carbohydrates should not exceed 5 mg/kg/min. Patients on cyclic TPN can often tolerate high glucose infusion rates.
C. **Protein Requirements**: Requirements range from 0.8-2.5 g/kg/day depending on the patient's clinical status. The table below provides examples of protein dosing for clinical conditions. However, the dietitian makes individualized recommendations for each patient on PN.

1. Protein provides 4 kilocalories/g.
D. **Fat Requirements**: Essential fatty acid (EFA) deficiency occurs when less than 4% kilocalories are supplied as linoleic acid. Clinical signs may be evident within 1 to 3 weeks of fat-free parenteral nutrition. EFA deficiency may be prevented by deriving 1 to 2% of daily energy requirements from linoleic acid and 0.5% of energy from alpha-linolenic acid. This translates to approximately 20% SMOFlipids 250 mL twice weekly or 500 mL once weekly to meet 13-25% of total calories. For patients who are intolerant to lipids, topical application or oral ingestion of oils can be considered based on anecdotal evidence and case reports.
    1. SMOFLipids (soybean, MCT, olive oil, fish oil):
        a) The usual daily dosage in adults is 1 to 2 grams/kg per day and should not exceed 2.5 grams/kg per day.
        b) SMOFlipid is a lipid injectable emulsion with a lipid content of 0.2 g/mL in 250 mL and 500 mL packages.
        c) Hypersensitivity Reactions
            (1) SMOFlipid contains soybean oil, fish oil, peanut, and egg phospholipids, which may cause hypersensitivity reactions.
E. **Vitamins**: Multiple vitamins for infusion (MVI) given daily will supply the recommended daily intravenous (IV) requirements for vitamins. Additional vitamins may be added depending on patient needs.

Vitamin K: 150 mcg

<a id='176c533a-b587-476a-ba12-f2eda61ac2b4'></a>

F. Trace Elements: The addition of trace elements should be individualized according to patient needs and length of therapy, with particular attention given to copper and manganese. It is recommended that 1 mL of trace elements be given daily unless the direct (conjugated) bilirubin is elevated ≥ 2 mg/dL. There is currently no evidence-based guidance in the literature for how often trace elements should be given when there is concern for impaired biliary excretion of copper and manganese. Based on consensus of practice, if direct bilirubin is ≥ 2 mg/dL trace elements may be given 1x/week at most.

<a id='92009df6-b9ce-4451-9e79-82d557be6be6'></a>

Exceptions should be made for patients on CRRT, who have higher copper needs. Even in the setting of elevated direct bilirubin, patients on CRRT may require an additional 1 to 3 mg of copper daily. In these cases trace elements can be removed to eliminate manganese, and standalone copper can be added back.

G. Electrolytes: Requirements are extremely variable and must be individualized.

1.  General guidelines for reasonable daily amounts in parenteral nutrition are as follows:
    *   Sodium: 1-2 mEq/kg (up to 154 mEq/L)
    *   Potassium: 1-2 mEq/kg (10 to 30 mEq/d is generally sufficient to prevent hypokalemia)
    *   Calcium: 10-15 mEq
    *   Magnesium: 8-20 mEq
    *   Phosphorus: 20-40 mmol
    *   Chloride: as needed to maintain acid-base balance
    *   Acetate: as needed to maintain acid-base balance

2.  Consider using oral or enterally administered multivitamins, electrolytes, or mineral products when appropriate. During times of national product storage, PN additives may be reserved for patients with therapeutic medical needs, multivitamins/multi-trace products may be rationed, and individual components may be added as necessary.

<a id='90d54c62-d84b-4092-aa39-3d15f7f9505e'></a>

IV. TOTAL PARENTERAL NUTRITION (TPN)

A. This is a hypertonic solution that requires infusion through a central line. It allows sufficient amounts of calories and protein to be given to patients requiring long-term therapy. These solutions allow the quantities of dextrose, amino acids, and electrolytes to be specified and tailored to the patient's needs.

B. Initiation

1. Confirm placement or access of a central venous catheter.
2. Enter initial orders in the IP GEN TPN/PPN Adult Protocol Order Set in the Electronic Medical Record (EMR).
3. Renew TPN daily by entering an order in the EMR.
4. Providers must enter the order in Epic or give a verbal order with readback to the pharmacist by 1300, seven days a week, including holidays. Modifications to the formulation cannot be made after 1300. The standard hang time is 2100.

C. Administration

1. When initiating TPN, check blood glucose levels every 6 hours for the first 24 hours.

2. If TPN must be suddenly stopped, check blood glucose within 30 to 60 minutes and monitor for hypoglycemia. If possible, administer Dextrose 10% at a minimum of 25 mL/hour.
3. When stopping TPN, decrease the rate by 50% for 1 to 2 hours before discontinuation to minimize the risk of rebound hypoglycemia.

<a id='6b72803b-3777-4ba0-9bc2-c007b2b4f7fa'></a>

D. **Monitoring**

1. The following labs are recommended prior to starting parenteral nutrition:
   a) Comprehensive Metabolic Panel
   b) Phosphorus, Magnesium
   c) Triglycerides
   d) Direct bilirubin
2. The following are recommended while the patient is on parenteral nutrition:
   a) Basic Metabolic Panel, Phosphorus, and Magnesium daily, then weekly once stable
   b) Triglycerides, liver function tests, and direct bilirubin once weekly
   c) CBC once weekly
   d) Other labs as needed
3. Albumin and prealbumin are not sensitive or specific enough to have any value in assessing nutritional status.

<a id='825ae547-c0d7-4f65-aa3c-7a433a145974'></a>

E. **Complications**: Common complications can be divided into three groups: mechanical, metabolic, and septic.
1. *Mechanical*: Mechanical complications occur in up to 5% of PN patients. Please see CVC procedures in the Patient Care Manual for more information.

V. PERIPHERAL PARENTERAL NUTRITION (PPN)

A. This solution contains amounts of dextrose and amino acids in concentrations that may be administered by the peripheral vein. Large volumes are often needed to meet caloric requirements, therefore concentrated TPN should be considered over PPN in patients with fluid restrictions. PPN is a hyperosmolar solution and puts patients at risk of developing phlebitis. Recommended PPN solutions use 10% dextrose and 4% amino acids, however this formulation can be individualized to the patient's nutritional needs as long as the osmolarity limit is not exceeded. A separate fat emulsion can be used to provide additional kcals and help decrease the osmolality of the solution.

B. Initiation:
1. Order entry follows the same guidelines and process as TPN (see section IV)
2. A new peripheral catheter should be placed prior to starting PPN.

C. Limitations:
1. The osmolarity of the final PPN mixture should not exceed 1100 mOsm/L.
2. Due to limitations in osmolarity and volume, PPN solutions may provide inadequate nutrition for some patients.
3. The recommended use for PPN is 5-14 days. Consider TPN if PPN provides insufficient nutrition and the anticipated need is more than 7 days.
4. Patients cannot be discharged to home on PPN.

D. Monitoring: Similar to TPN, routine monitoring of metabolic and nutritional parameters is recommended for PPN.

VI. INTRAVENOUS FAT EMULSION

A. **Purpose**: Fat emulsion may be used as a concentrated caloric source and as a source of essential fatty acids. They are available in 20% solutions and should not be used alone but as a part of the TPN/PPN regimen. Most of the intravenous fat emulsion products in

the US have been soybean oil based. In 2016, the FDA approved a new combination
product, SMOFlipid, that combines soybean oil, medium-chain triglycerides, olive oil,
and fish oil. SMOFlipid has a lesser inflammatory effect due to the other fat sources
providing omega-3 fatty acids and reduced content of omega-6 fatty acids.

<a id='12164954-446e-45c0-9f31-8ed8ef3781fb'></a>

**B. Administration:**
1. Specify volume, concentration (20%), and administration rate for fat emulsion in order entry.
2. Fat Emulsion Hang-Time: Per CDC guidelines, fat emulsions should be hung for a 12-hour time period. However, a recent literature review reveals a 24-hour hang-time is safe. It is recommended to limit the infusion rate to a maximum of 0.11 g/kg/hr.
3. For more information, please see Intravenous Infusion - Parenteral Nutrition - TPN, PPN, Lipid Emulsion Infusion found at [https://stanfordhealthcare.policytech.com/docview/?docid=6890](https://stanfordhealthcare.policytech.com/docview/?docid=6890)

<a id='45dd7fa2-e922-45d8-8644-e2b4b9949faa'></a>

C. **Monitoring**: Liver function tests, prothrombin time, and platelets should be ordered at
least once weekly. Serum triglycerides should be monitored weekly while receiving
intravenous lipids.
D. **Complications**: Hypertriglyceridemia can occur if fat emulsion is administered at a rate >
0.11 g/kg/hr. This can lead to impaired immune response, increased risk of pancreatitis,
and altered pulmonary hemodynamics. Allergic reactions, though rare, can occur in
patients with an allergy to soy, peanut, or egg for either product. Additional allergy
interactions for SMOFlipid include fish allergy.

VII. TRANSITIONAL FEEDINGS

A. **Cyclic TPN**: Parenteral Nutrition should be initiated as a 24-hour continuous infusion prior to cycling. Infuse cyclic TPN at half the rate for the first and last hours to avoid hyper- and hypoglycemia.

B. **Enteral Nutrition**: Before transitioning off TPN, adequate enteral intake must be attained. After GI function is established, enteral alimentation may be initiated.

   1. TPN is decreased as enteral intake is increased in order for total intake to meet nutritional needs. Tapering of the parenteral infusion can be initiated when the patient is able to consume the equivalent of 500 calories or more per day. Parenteral feedings should not be discontinued until 50% to 70% of energy, protein, and fluid needs are consumed enterally. Depending on the patient's condition, oral intake may be advanced as tolerated.

C. **Transitioning to Home TPN**: Prior to starting home TPN, it must be determined if the burden of home TPN outweighs the benefits. To determine appropriateness, non-clinical parameters must be addressed. Things to consider include:
1. Cultural/religious values.
2. Ability for patient or caregiver to manage home TPN (comprehension, manual dexterity, and the ability to learn TPN administration and care).
3. Home safety (clean environment with storage capability, non-hostile environment).
4. Access to care (an outpatient provider willing to oversee the TPN, infusion, and home care nursing as needed, laboratory monitoring, home location, transportation).
5. Health insurance and costs.
   a) Once a patient is determined as an appropriate candidate for TPN, he/she should be clinically stable prior to discharge, and tolerance to TPN should be established (blood sugars, electrolytes, fluid status). Ideally, the patient will transition to cyclic TPN prior to discharge.
   b) The primary team must identify an outpatient provider who will continue to sign the TPN orders and oversee the medical management of the TPN prior to discharge. The Case Manager assists with securing a home infusion company and home health services prior to discharge.
