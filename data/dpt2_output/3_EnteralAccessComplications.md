Your patient is a 53-year-old female who had a PEG placed after a recent stroke. She is tube-feed dependent. Which of the following is **FALSE** regarding maintaining a patent tube?

A. Frequent flushing of the feeding tube helps maintain patency
B. Coca-Cola® flushes are effective to resolve clogs
C. Crushed medications increase the risk of tube clogging
D. Tension on the feeding tube can result in tube dislodgement

## PEG / PEJ / G- / J-TUBES

*   If dislodged → Call surgeon / surgical team promptly
*   Major problems
    *   Tube clogging (diameter, content administered)
    *   Balloon rupture
    *   Dislodgement
    *   Bowel obstruction (J-tubes)
    *   Leakage around the tube (both externally and internally)
*   Assessment of external bumper tension
    *   Avoid "compulsive" bumper tightening
    *   Risk of "buried bumper" syndrome

## FEEDING TUBE MAINTENANCE

*   Flush tube at regular intervals and after each use to maintain patency (15-30 mL every 4 hours and after feeds / meds is common)
*   Clogging or luminal obstruction
    *   The most common mechanical complication
    *   Often due to inadequate flushing
*   If naso- or oroenteric tube involved:
    *   Try to unclog
    *   If unsuccessful or recurrent obstruction, replace the tube
*   For surgical tubes:
    *   Try everything possible to unclog
    *   If unable to unclog, consult the physician(s) who placed the tube
    *   Tube replacement should prompt post-procedure position verification

## FEEDING TUBE MAINTENANCE

*   Tube dressing
    *   No dressing is best
    *   Simple gauze is acceptable if leakage or bleeding
*   External bumper → Ensure 0.5-0.75 cm clearance
*   Avoid overzealous external bumper tightening!
*   If tube is leaking
    *   Avoid "upsizing" the tube
    *   Provide adequate wound care
    *   Consider delayed gastric emptying / obstruction

<::A close-up photo shows a person's abdomen with a feeding tube inserted, held by gloved hands. A measuring device is visible near the tube's entry point, indicating measurement of the external bumper clearance.

# FEEDING TUBE CLOGGING

*   Why do tubes clog?
    *   Thickened formula residue
    *   Medication particles
    *   Incompatible substances
    *   Inadequate flushing
*   Prevention:
    *   Flush tube with water every 4 hours
    *   Flush with water before / after medications

Tips for keeping ENFit feeding tube ports clean. Inspect before you connect!
* Priming Feeding Sets - Stop priming before fluid reaches the end of the tube.
* ENFit Syringe Draw Up - Wipe medication and nutrition from tip/outer threads, keep fluids out of dead space before connecting to feeding tube.

For best results, follow these instructions to clean tubes at least once a day or whenever material is visible.

# OTHER COMPLICATIONS & PREVENTIVE STRATEGIES

*   Delayed gastric emptying → Elevate HOB 30° during and at least 1 hour after feeding; reduce feeds rate; metoclopramide...
*   Nasopharyngeal breakdown / irritation → Use soft, small-bore tube; tape the tube properly to prevent undue pressure on nostril
    *   — Can't miss this! [Medico-legal risk]
*   Bridle device- umbilical tape passed around nasal septum- prevents dislodgement

# BLEEDING

# NASOENTERIC ACCESS

- Placement considerations:
  - Difficulty during placement?
    - STOP
    - Re-assess
    - Ask for assistance
  - X-ray verification

- Awareness of complications:
  - Dislodgement
  - Epistaxis
  - Sinusitis
  - Nasal erosion / necrosis
  - Perforation
  - Aspiration
  - Pain / discomfort
  - Migration / displacement

AIRWAY PLACEMENT RISKS

* Aspiration
* Airway perforation leading to pneumothorax and bronchopleural fistula
* Pneumonia
* Coughing is the main warning sign of misplacement
* Auscultation of tube flushing in the stomach is insufficient
* X-ray confirmation is required before feeding

WHEN A NASOENTERIC TUBE
REQUIRES REMOVAL

<a id='6e77e923-9ad3-468e-9b0f-f308f06a1098'></a>

* Persistent kinking of the tube
  - Once kinked, tube significantly more likely to kink in the same location
  - Tube kinking leads to either discomfort, obstruction, or both
* Injury would occur if tube left in place
  - Nasal / facial tissue erosions → Immediately remove; Place PEG or surgical tube
  - Sinusitis → Replace nasal tube with PEG or surgical tube
  - Bleeding → Remove tube; Ensure coagulation status OK; Replace when bleeding resolved
  - Significant discomfort (risk-benefit)

# NASOENTERIC PLACEMENT

Placement tips:
*   Estimate the expected distance of tube insertion
    *   Based on how the "nose-to-ear-to-stomach" distance
*   Assess the mental status, gag reflex, nostrils
    *   Is the patient cooperative?
*   If rubber tube, place on ice for 5 min → Tube stiffens making the insertion easier
*   If plastic tube, place in warm water → Softens the tube, making it more flexible
*   Use appropriate (water-based) lubricant, possibly analgesic spray

NASOENTERIC PLACEMENT, CONT.

: figure::>

<a id='9fe053e9-d662-4f46-a27e-67bc35ee2b32'></a>

Placement tips:
- If possible, the patient is sitting in the "high Fowler's" position
  - Head facing forward (chin-toward-chest, sipping water, etc)
- Advance the tube in downward and backward direction as the patient swallows
  - Stop when the patient is breathing

<::A diagram illustrating different angles of a patient's sitting position, representing Fowler's position. The diagram shows a silhouette of a person sitting with their back supported at various angles: 0, 30, 45, and 90 degrees. The 90-degree position, labeled "90", shows the person sitting upright. The 45-degree position, labeled "45", shows the person reclined at a 45-degree angle. The 30-degree position, labeled "30", shows the person reclined at a 30-degree angle. The 0-degree position, labeled "0", shows the person lying flat.
