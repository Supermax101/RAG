## Venous Access

### Central Access
*   Tip is positioned in a central vein
    *   Superior vena cava (SVC)
    *   Inferior vena cava (IVC)
    *   Right atrium (RA)
        *   Risk of cardiac perforation/arrhythmia (particularly small neonates)

### Peripheral Access
*   Tip is not positioned in the SVC, IVC, or RA

<::A diagram illustrating a human torso with various central venous catheter insertion points. The diagram shows the following labeled parts and catheter placements:
- "internal jugular vein insertion" pointing to a catheter entering the neck.
- "Subclavian vein insertion" pointing to a catheter entering the upper chest near the shoulder.
- "PICC" (Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter) pointing to a catheter entering the arm.
- "Heart" labeled in the center of the chest.
- "Femoral vein catheter" pointing to a catheter entering the groin area.
Each catheter has external tubing with multiple ports. The background is blue with faint ECG-like lines.

Venous Access: Alternative Sites

### Scalp veins (neonates)
*   Alternative site of venous access
*   Often visible and easily accessible
    (lack of hair, thin skin)
*   Not preferred for long-term access

# Venous Access Considerations

## Peripheral Access
* Used for <2 weeks
* Nutrient needs can be met by peripheral PN
* No fluid restriction
* Osmolality <900 mOsm/L
  * Maximum 10 - 12.5% dextrose

## Central Access
* Used for >2 weeks
* Nutrient needs cannot be met by peripheral PN
* Peripheral access limited
* Patient is fluid restricted
* Need for hypertonic solutions

## Venous Access Additional Considerations

*   The more lumens, the higher the chances of infection
*   Impregnated, or locked catheters can be useful to prevent infection, thromboses
    *   May contain antibiotics, antiseptics, antithrombolytics, antifibrinolytics
    *   May cause allergic response, potentially higher rates of catheter breakage
*   Line must be secured, and meticulous sterile technique used with access

# Venous Access: Alternative Sites

* Filters are placed between the PN solution and patient to remove hazardous particulate matter (e.g., pathogens)

<::transcription of the content
: Diagram of a filter device with an air vent and an arrow indicating "Flow toward patient"::>

* Traditionally two filter sizes available (0.22 microns + 1.2 microns)

<a id='b3cd971b-60f4-4436-81f3-e14074a567bf'></a>

<::
0.22 micron filters
* Removes most pathogenic bacteria
* Only compatible with 2-in-1 solutions

1.2 micron filters
* Removes *Candida* + large lipid droplets
* May be used with 3-in-1 solutions

<::diagram
: The diagram illustrates a medical infusion setup. At the top, there are two intravenous (IV) bags. The bag on the left is labeled "PN" (Parenteral Nutrition), and the bag on the right is labeled "Lipid emulsion". Each bag is connected via tubing to a "Large volume pump" positioned below it. The tubing from both pumps converges into a single line. This merged line then passes through a component labeled "1.2-micron filter". Finally, the filtered line leads to a connection point labeled "Patient". Arrows along the tubing indicate the flow direction from the bags, through the pumps, merging, through the filter, and towards the patient.::>
