A 28 year old man was admitted to the ICU 7 days ago with multiple trauma following a motor vehicle accident. He has not tolerated EN due to intra-abdominal injuries. The medical team is considering starting PN by peripheral vein (PPN). Which of the following statements best describes PPN?

A. The osmolality limit for PPN is set at 600 mOsm/L
B. The expected duration of therapy should be greater than 2 weeks.

# INITIATING NUTRITION SUPPORT SAFELY

**Judicious selection of candidates**
* Interdisciplinary collaboration
* Evidence based guidelines for indications
* Patient and caregiver agreement

**Appropriate indication for nutrition support**
* Assessment of risk versus benefit
* Timing of intervention is consistent with guidelines
* Nutrition plan is aligned with overall plan of care

**Decisions guided by results of assessment findings**
* Nutrition status
* Gl function
* Clinical and metabolic stability

**Evaluation of potential for complications**
* Risk for complications of nutrition support access
* Risk for refeeding syndrome

NUTRITION SUPPORT GUIDELINES

*   Enteral nutrition is preferred when GI tract is functional
*   Advantages of enteral nutrition
    *   Relies on normal digestive pathways
    *   Provides a more complete range of nutrients
    *   Preserves integrity of the gut, especially immune factors

"IF THE GUT
WORKS, USE IT"

*   Associated with favorable outcomes compared to parenteral nutrition
    *   Lower risk of infection
    *   Fewer metabolic complications than IV route
    *   Less expensive than parenteral nutrition
*   Reserve PN for situation where GI function is inadequate

# GUIDELINES FOR PN INITIATION

*   Do not use based solely on medical diagnosis or disease state
*   Evaluate clinical factors from history, physical examination, and diagnostic evaluations in determining if EN is not feasible
*   Conduct a clinical review to assess PN appropriateness prior to compounding the PN admixture
*   Use PN in patients who are malnourished or at risk for malnutrition when:
    *   A contraindication to EN exists OR
    *   Patient cannot tolerate adequate EN OR
    *   Lacks sufficient bowel function to maintain or restore nutrition status due to GI dysfunction

# DOUBLE CHECK PUMP SETTINGS

*   Pump- related errors
    *   Wide use of multichannel pumps: enteral and parenteral
    *   Pump programming errors most common; potential for severe harm
    *   Double checks to verify pump settings
    *   Performed by 2 clinicians alone and apart from each other
    *   Expand to additional phases of nutrition support administration based on quality data, patient population
*   When administering the dextrose/amino acid component of the PN and the ILE as separate infusions, the first infusion must be completely set up before the set up for the second infusion begins.

■ **The Administration Procedures for Nutrition Support**
- Maintain infusion at prescribed rate
  - Use nurse-driven protocols for EN administration
  - Avoid interruptions of PN and EN for routine care or GRVs < 500 mL
  - Limit "NPO" periods for EN
  - Do not adjust PN rate for infusions that are off schedule
- Implement guidelines for medication administration with EN and co-infusion of medication with PN
- Maintain infection control measures

  - » TNA
  - » Dextrose/amino acid PN formulations (2-in-1)

* Not suitable for patients with hypermetabolism or a catabolic state
* Requires relatively large fluid volumes
* Use as supplemental PN or a bridge therapy:
  - Oral intake or EN is suboptimal
  - Avoids risks inherent to central line placement
  - Central line access not feasible
  - Maximum duration of 10-14 days
* Better nutrient provision with osmolality limit of 900 mOsm/L
* Associated with increased rates of infusion phlebitis

# SWITCHING TO PN: TIMING

*   Initiate PN after 7 days for well-nourished, stable adult patients who have been unable to receive significant (50% or more of estimated requirements) oral or enteral nutrients
*   Initiate PN within 3–5 days in those who are nutritionally at-risk and unlikely to achieve desired oral intake or EN
*   Initiate PN as soon as is feasible for patients with baseline moderate or severe malnutrition in whom oral intake or EN is not possible or sufficient
*   Delay the initiation of PN in a patient with severe metabolic instability until the patient's condition has improved

## SELF ASSESSMENT #6

PN is initiated for nutritional support. On the second night the nurse calls the pharmacy to report that the the PN filter seems to be occluded and a "high pressure" pump alarm has sounded. What is the most appropriate course of action in this situation?

option A: [ ] Silence the alarm
option B: [ ] Send a new filter to the unit
option C: [ ] Remove the filter and continue the infusion
option D: [ ] Stop the infusion and review the PN formulation

- High pressure pump alarms and occluded filters

  - Verify pressure setting on pump
  - Precipitate or particulate matter present
  - Rule out mechanical or thrombotic causes

- Pharmacy must review PN formulation for precipitates, incompatibilities, or
cracked emulsions?
- Never allow infusion of unfiltered PN and ILE formulations

## RECOMMENDATIONS:
## FILTERS FOR PN AND ILE

*   In-line filters are required on all PN and ILE infusions
*   In-line filters serve to reduce exposure to particulate matter during PN administration
    *   A 1.2 micron in-line filter is recommended for administration of both TNAs and 2-in-1 PNs
    *   For TNAs, place the filter as close to the catheter hub as possible
    *   For 2-in-1 PNs, place the filter below the Y-site where the dextrose-amino acid admixture and the ILE co-infuse
*   This practice is supported by decades of experience in hospital and home PN administration settings. This approach also eliminates filter confusion.

The pump connected to the PN bag is labeled "Large volume pump" on its left side, and the pump connected to the Lipid emulsion bag is labeled "Large volume pump" on its right side. Both pumps have a keypad with a grid of buttons (8x4 grid). The tubing from both pumps merges into a single line. This combined line then passes through a "1.2-micron filter" before connecting to the "Patient". Arrows indicate the flow direction from the bags, through the pumps, merging, through the filter, and finally to the patient.::>

## WEANING PN

* Wean PN when oral intake and/or EN achieves 50%-75% of requirements for energy, protein, and micronutrients.
* Continue PN when impaired GI function precludes 100% absorption of nutrient needs
* Consider using a weaning protocol during the transition from PN to EN

# CONCLUSIONS

*   Judicious selection of candidates for nutrition support is essential for achieving optimal patient outcomes
*   Use clinical assessment, rather than medical diagnosis, to identify candidates for PN, as well as situations in which PN is not likely to be of benefit
*   Establish protocols for initiating and administering nutrition support therapy that incorporate guidelines for patient safety
