# Case

3-week-old boy born at 23-week gestation developed septic shock, renal failure, necrotizing enterocolitis, and bowel perforation. He was treated with peritoneal washouts, drains, antimicrobials, and bowel rest. PN was started on DOL#1, but lipids were intermittently held since birth due to fluid overload and hypertriglyceridemia. He was later diagnosed with intestinal failure-associated liver disease (IFALD) (direct bilirubin > 2 mg/dL) and essential fatty acid deficiency (EFAD) (T:T > 0.2). What is the most appropriate IV lipid emulsion (ILE) for this infant?

(T:T > 0.05

EFAD can develop rapidly in premature infants who do not
receive an adequate amount of lipid. Therefore, ILE
withholding and ILE dose restriction is not appropriate for
premature infants. ILEs should be given consistently to
prevent an EFAD. The optimal type and dose of ILE depends
on the patient's age, liver status, clinical goal, and nutritional
goals. In this case, a 100% fish oil ILE dosed at ≥ 1 g/kg/day
can safely and effectively treat the infant's EFAD, IFALD, and
hypertriglyceridemia.
