CONCLUSIONS

*   A thorough history and physical, including medication review, is important for identification and diagnosis of electrolyte disorders.
*   Knowledge of causes of electrolyte disorders will help in determining appropriate prevention and treatment plan development.
*   Development of a nutrition care plan should be done using a systematic approach including comorbid states, medication therapy, and changes in clinical status.
