**Presentation Overview/Summary**
This presentation will cover the foundational principles related to parenteral nutrition (PN). Topics will include protein/calorie requirements, electrolyte and fluid balance and acid-base balance. The care of the home PN patient will be addressed. Appropriate candidates for home PN and monitoring strategies will be discussed.

<a id='77fc919c-69cf-43a8-bd63-4259be3516f0'></a>

## Learning Objectives
At the conclusion of the presentation, the learner will be able to:
1. Discuss indications for parenteral nutrition (PN)
2. Review parenteral prescription process
3. Develop a proper plan for PN monitoring and management
4. Identify issues related to safe practice

<a id='8d734950-ee06-49f3-b465-1356978d2c2e'></a>

Key Takeaways/Fast Facts
* PN is a high risk medication that requires close management in the inpatient and home arena.
* There are roughly 56,000 patients on home PN in the United States.
* Safe delivery of PN is the responsibility of healthcare providers, patients, and caregivers.

4. Question 4: Which of the following elements can compromise TNA (3-in-1 PN) stability?
A. Amino acid final concentration < 4%
B. Dextrose final concentration < 10%
C. ILE final concentration < 2%
D. **All of the above**

<a id='1181f2e3-380f-4a04-909f-dc3e81fe5977'></a>

5. Question 5: Which of the following lipid injectable emulsions (ILE) contains the highest amount of phytosterol?
option FO-ILE: [ ]
option OO-SO-ILE: [ ]
option SO-MCT-OO-FO-ILE: [ ]
option SO-ILE: [x]

<a id='6983c8bb-799a-4145-b9be-1388ba920c7a'></a>

## Learning Assessment Answers:

1.  Answer = False; Rationale: Peripheral PN is a short term option for the provision of nutrition support. It is limited by large amounts of fluids required to deliver adequate nutrition. Those who have significant malnutrition, severe metabolic stress, large nutrient needs, fluid restrictions, or the need for prolonged PN are not candidates for Peripheral PN.
2.  Answer = B; Rationale: Current recommendations state that ILE within a TNA should have a maximum hang time of 24 hours. Recommendations also state than ILE piggybacked into a 2-in-1 PN solution should have a maximum hang time of 12 hours. Tubing should also be changed every 12 hours when ILE is piggybacked with 2-in-1 PN. These recommendations also state that if ILE is to be infused separately over > 12 hours, the dose should be divided into two parts with a new container and tubing every 12 hours.
3.  Answer = B; Rationale: To minimize extravasation and pheblitis risk, the recommended osmolarity limit for peripheral PN is < 900 mOsm/L.
4.  Answer = D; Rationale: TNA stability is compromised by the following: amino acid final concentration < 4%, dextrose final concentration < 10%, ILE final concentration < 2%, high cation concentrations (Ca++, Mg, iron), and admixture of dextrose directly with ILE.
5.  Answer = D; Rationale: SO-ILE contains the highest amount of phytosterol when compared to the other ILEs available in the US market.
