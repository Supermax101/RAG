# Milrinone in Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia

Krisa Van Meurs, MD and Valerie Chock, MD, MS EPI

The research is a pilot trial to determine if milrinone infusion in neonates â‰¥36 weeks at birth with CDH will lead to an increase in PaO2 with a corresponding decrease in OI either by itself or in conjunction with other pulmonary vasodilators such as iNO. As secondary objectives, the study will determine if milrinone improves oxygenation at 48 and 72 hours post-infusion, reduces right ventricular pressures on echocardiogram, and alters the risk of systemic hypotension, arrhythmias, intracranial hemorrhage, need for ECMO, and chronic lung disease. Screening for this study is expected to open in early 2018. (NICHD)

Listening to Mom in the NICU: Neural, Clinical and Language Outcomes
Katherine Travis, PhD,

<a id='545bc403-32b6-4e0c-8c10-e5edad89e648'></a>

Children born preterm are at-risk for developmental language delays. Language problems in preterm children are thought to be related to neurobiological factors, including injuries to white matter structures of the brain and environmental factors, including decreased exposure to maternal speech in the hospital nursery. To help minimize these problems, the present research aims to demonstrate that a language intervention, which involves playing recordings of a mother's voice to the infant while s/he is in the hospital nursery, will be effective for promoting healthy brain and language development in preterm babies.

The goal of this study is to use near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in preterm infants (<1250 g birth weight) to measure cerebral oxygenation and autoregulation non-invasively in the first 96 hours of life. These NIRS measures will then be correlated with mortality and significant CNS morbidities including intraventricular hemorrhage and white matter injury as determined by cranial ultrasound and MRI. NIRS monitoring has the potential for identifying preterm infants at highest risk for death or neurologic injury.

**Bilirubin binding capacity**

Vinod K. Bhutani, MD, David Stevenson, MD and Angelo Lamola, PhD

<a id='56168c47-12ce-4938-81d3-4fdc95408547'></a>

BBC defines the dynamic relationship between an infant's level of unbound or "free" bilirubin and his/her ability to "tolerate" increasing bilirubin loads. BBC is not synonymous with albumin levels because albumin binding of bilirubin is confounded by a variety of molecular, biologic, and metabolic factors. We have finalized a novel modification of a previously developed hematofluorometric method to directly assay BBC in whole blood from preterm and term neonates. Our data suggests that individualized BBC assays would provide a robust approach to gauge risk of bilirubin neurotoxicity compared with total bilirubin and gestational age to guide individualized thresholds for intervention.

**Intermittent Phototherapy: A Safer Method to Treat Extremely Low Birth Weight Infants?**

David Stevenson, MD, Vinod Bhutani, MD, Ronald Cohen, MD

<a id='cdd91677-53a2-4a97-8b2b-a918b6c2e678'></a>

Phototherapy with uninterrupted exposure to bright lights is used in treatment for almost all extremely low birth weight infants to lower their serum bilirubin. However, this treatment may cause serious phototoxicity in these immature babies. We will determine whether intermittent ("cycled") phototherapy administered for as little as 15 min or 30 min per hour prevents phototoxicity while effective lowering their total bilirubin level and preventing bilirubin neurotoxicity.

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) Point-of-care testing

<a id='51a56319-46a1-4f86-98a6-f3218d74bbbf'></a>

The traditional paradigm for newborn screening is through analysis of dried blood spots, which are sent to a central laboratory for processing with a few days turnaround. Point-of-care screening could provide benefits but as of yet there is not a single point-of-care newborn screening technology available for biochemical screening. We are developing a point-of-care platform using a miniature version of digital microfluidic technology for the immediate detection and diagnosis of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia with measurements for total serum bilirubin, G6PD, albumin, carboxyhemoglobin, and bilirubin binding capacity.

Neuro-humoral Biomakers for Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC)

Vinod K. Bhutani, MD and Susan Crowe, MD

<a id='38313fd6-0458-4f5c-a8c9-8892125b3e32'></a>

The process of skin-to-skin holding of the infant by the mother immediately after birth triggers a lowering of the in utero sedative neurosteroids which function to dampen fetal consciousness. We propose that altered neurologic development in preterm and small for gestational age infants is related to an incomplete or failed transition of consciousness after birth, resulting in disturbances of self-regulation of breathing, maintenance of body temperature, breast feeding behavior, maternal recognition, and ultimately in abnormal neurologic development.

Point-of Care Testing for Maternal-neonatal Rh status

<a id='329b0925-31ac-4309-b7cb-bae5bc6c2be8'></a>

Vinod K. Bhutani, MD

Usually blood groups are determined by obtaining a blood sample, testing in an immunohematology laboratory and communication of the results to those caring for the patient. The Eldon card system provides immediate point-of-care determination of Rh blood group which could be applicable not only in hospital but also in community settings and homes. This uses a single drop of capillary blood, an Eldon card and produces a result in two minutes. A study of Eldon card blood group determination of women in the antenatal clinics and postpartum will be undertaken comparing the results of the Eldon card to the "gold standard" of a blood test in an immunohematology laboratory.

Non-Contact Vital Sign Monitor for the NICU

Henry C. Lee, MD, MS Epi

<a id='c21a0aa1-601f-4cc5-87c8-bb347af32d8f'></a>

Conventional vital sign monitors use mechanical or adhesive sensors that physically contact the infant patient's skin. They are prone to false alarms caused by infant patient movement and sensor dislodgment. The purpose of the study is to support the further product development of a non-invasive, non-contact, camera system to reliably monitor the heart rate, temperature and breathing of high-risk infant patients in NICU environments. Infant patients will continue to be monitored using the standard of care equipment. Data from the study will not inform patient care.

<a id='b20dd6dc-5214-43dc-9945-72f8f8ca7842'></a>

Informed consent is an essential element in the research process. Following is information regarding consenting families who are not present in the NICU and usage of the Short Form Consent Process for families who do not speak English, circumstances that are often considerations when conducting clinical research in neonatology.

<a id='6595ef0c-d6b4-45b8-b9cd-aee41cff6a34'></a>

I. **Telephone Consent**

Participation in a research study is not an emergency, thus the usual method of obtaining consent for clinical care does not apply.

If a child's parents are unable to be present to participate in the informed consent process for a research study, telephone consent may be obtained using the following procedure:

*   Fax or email the informed consent and HIPAA authorization documents to the parents
*   Call the parents and explain the study (neonatologist, fellow or knowledgeable member of the research team)
*   Parents sign the consent and HIPAA documents (if they want child to participate)
*   Parents send signed consent and HIPAA authorization back (fax or scan and email)
*   Parents bring original documents to LPCH

If the child is being transported to LPCH, the transport team can be asked to provide the consent and HIPAA documents to the family for review and signature. Alternatively, the consent and HIPAA authorization can be faxed to the unit where the child is and the transport team can be asked to bring the signed documents back. Whichever method is used, the neonatologist, fellow or research team member should conduct the full informed consent process with the family over the telephone.

<a id='22b6a6d3-9af9-4f2f-af51-036c70e198bf'></a>

## II. Foreign Language Consent

In general, the informed consent and HIPAA authorization documents should be available in the preferred language of the child's parents. In practice that may not be possible, in which case the Short Form Consent Process is used.

### A. Short Form Consent - The short form is a generic document describing clinical research and containing the Experimental Subject's Bill of Rights. The short form does not contain study-specific information. It is the responsibility of the person obtaining consent to assure that the parents are fully informed about the nature of the research. The IRB website contains templates of Stanford's short form in several of the languages commonly spoken in our population.
