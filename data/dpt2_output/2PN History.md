<::Two black and white photographs of infants. The top photo shows an infant lying on its back, with its right arm raised and left arm by its side. The infant appears to be very thin, with visible ribs and some skin markings. It is lying on a white cloth in what looks like an incubator or medical bed. The bottom photo shows another infant, also lying on its back, looking towards the viewer. This infant also appears to be in a medical setting, possibly an incubator, with its arms bent and legs slightly spread. Both infants appear to be newborns or very young babies.: figure::>
