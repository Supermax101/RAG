# SELF-ASSESSMENT #1

The pharmacy receives a request to increase the PN formulation for a patient in ICU. The prescriber indicates that the reason for adjusting the PN formulation is based on the patient's albumin level of 2.9 mg/dL. Which of the following best describes the use of albumin levels in this clinical situation?

A. The albumin level represents moderate to severe malnutrition
B. Low albumin levels indicate the need to increase protein intake
C. Both protein and energy should be increased
D. Albumin levels do not serve a valid markers of nutrition status

SELF-ASSESSMENT #2

A patient with a small bowel obstruction is to begin PN. Nutrition assessment has documented that the patient has had a 35-pound unintentional weight loss prior to this admission. His baseline laboratory tests show the following: serum potassium 2.9 mEq/dL; serum magnesium 1.2 mEq/dL; serum phosphate 1.8 mg/dL. Which of the following represents the best course action in this situation?

A. Restrict ILE administration
B. Initiate PN promptly with standard electrolytes
C. Delay PN to correct electrolyte abnormalities
D. Increase calories provided by dextrose in the base PN formulation

## MONITORING: SCOPE AND FREQUENCY

*   Influencing Factors
    *   Type of nutrition support
        *   PN generally requires more intensive monitoring than EN
    *   Setting in which nutrition support takes place
        *   Critical care versus Home Care
    *   Nature and acuity of underlying disease
    *   Stability of previous monitoring results
    *   Tolerance of nutrition support therapy
    *   Duration of therapy
        *   Less frequent monitoring is appropriate in stable home patients

# MONITORING ADEQUACY AND TOLERANCE OF PN, CONT.

*   Shortages, allergies, nutrient intolerance
    *   Nutrient shortages: vitamins, electrolytes, amino acids, lipids, etc.
    *   Disorders of lipid metabolism
    *   Allergy: often related to the excipient in multivitamin product
*   Problems related to infusion cycle
    *   Hyperglycemia
    *   Shortness of breath
    *   Nocturia
*   Vascular access
    *   Disruptions in care due to complications: CLABSI, DVT, occlusion

Parenteral Nutrition Safety Consensus Recommendations:
* Vascular access devices used for PN administration should not be used to obtain blood samples for laboratory tests unless no peripheral access is available.

Rationale:
* Manipulation of the line for blood withdrawal is associated with increased risk for microbial contamination
* PN is an independent risk factor for CLABSI
* Blood samples drawn incorrectly during PN infusion can lead to spurious laboratory values.

# ALBUMIN, PREALBUMIN AND TRANSFERRIN LEVELS

* Current guidelines recommend against using albumin, prealbumin (also called transthyretin) and transferrin to assess nutritional status or monitor response to therapy
* A single measurement of albumin can provide prognostic information regarding surgical risk
* These proteins act as negative acute-phase proteins: levels fall precipitously during inflammation
* Today these proteins are recognized as surrogate markers of inflammation, rather than indicators of nutrition status

* Provide nutrition counseling and dietary guidance as indicated
* Optimize pharmacologic management of GI symptoms
* Eliminate 1 or 2 non-consecutive infusions per week; in children consider reducing PN by a small percentage every week
* Increase frequency of weight and metabolic monitoring during the transition
* Further reductions if nutrition and hydration status remains stable
* Evaluate the need for oral or intravenous fluid, electrolytes, and/or vitamins
* Make a nutrition monitoring plan after PN is stopped to ensure safe transition to full oral or enteral nutrition.

## CONCLUSIONS

*   The nutrition plan of care should be evaluated and revised based on results of ongoing monitoring.
*   The goal of monitoring aims to determine the appropriateness of the nutrition interventions, ensure attainment of nutrition goals and to reduce the risk of adverse events related to therapy.
*   The scope and frequency of monitoring is determined by the metabolic and clinical stability of the patient and the healthcare setting in which nutrition support is administered.
