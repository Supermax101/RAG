Neonates are at high risk for seizure in a number of clinical scenarios:\n1. HIE (40-60% have seizures)\n2. ECMO (10-20% have seizures)\n3. S/P certain cardiac surgeries (5-20%)\n4. Stroke/hemorrhage/SVT (~80% of neonatal stroke presents as seizure)\n5. CNS Infections\n6. Genetic/metabolic conditions\n\nB. All neonates with clinically suspected seizures should receive immediate aEEG and urgent Video EEG (VEEG) monitoring for confirmation of diagnosis and ongoing management. Separate aEEG should be discontinued when VEEG is initiated-- aEEG trends can be displayed at bedside using most of the VEEG machines, and technical problems arise if both sets of electrodes are used simultaneously.\n1. 80-90% of neonatal seizures are **subclinical**, with no outward signs, and can only be diagnosed by VEEG/aEEG.\n2. Up to 50% of abnormal movements suspected to be seizures in NICU babies are **not** seizures on EEG, but rather are seizure mimics.\n3. aEEG is initiated by the NICU team.\na. aEEG is interpreted at the bedside on an ongoing basis by NICU staff\nb. When interpreted by experienced users, aEEG identifies about 2/3 of patients with seizures, but is less accurate for identifying (quantifying) individual seizures.\nc. aEEG is a great option for immediate monitoring to see if a baby is having any seizures, until the EEG tech arrives to start vEEG for precise diagnosis.\n4. To request video EEG monitoring (including urgent vEEG at night and on weekends if available), the NICU fellow/attending should page the neurology resident on call. Ordering VEEG in Epic will **not** initiate vEEG without this conversation.\na. If clinically suspected seizure occurs while on video EEG, press the event button to mark the event on the EEG file, and write a description on the bedside log.\nb. If seizures are suspected based on aEEG changes, enter in comment at bedside (if aEEG machine), or push event button to mark area of concern (if vEEG machine)\nc. The neurology team should be contacted to review events as needed to confirm whether or not they are seizures. Otherwise, VEEG is reviewed at least twice daily by the EEG attending, and daily reports are posted in EPIC.\n\n<a id='f2d58b7b-738b-493f-915b-e78c5e70d53a'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

A number of sudden, stereotyped clinical events raise suspicion for seizures:\n\n1.  Autonomic changes\n    a. Unexplained apnea in a term baby is a seizure until proven otherwise.\n    b. Isolated heart rate or blood pressure changes are rarely seizures.\n\n2.  Focal clonic, tonic movements\n    a. More likely seizure if they are high amplitude, regular frequency, and cannot be suppressed\n    b. Less likely seizure if elicited by positioning/movement, involve all extremities, and can be stopped with restraint or passive flexion\n    c. Benign sleep myoclonus can last for several minutes and be a close seizure mimic; it is distinguished from seizures by only occurring in sleep in an otherwise healthy baby\n\n3.  Forced eye/gaze deviation\n\n4.  Tonic stiffening\n\n<a id='e6159d0d-a9f5-43b2-805f-805531eb2144'></a>\n\n## II. Seizure Types\n\nA. Subclinical & Subtle: most common type in newborns. Occur in both term and premature infants. Clinical manifestations may be absent entirely, or if present include:\n\n1.  Ocular movements: conjugate horizontal deviation, repetitive blinking or fluttering of eyelids, sustained eye opening with ocular fixation\n2.  Oral-buccal-lingual movements: chewing, drooling, sucking, tongue thrusting\n3.  Bicycling/pedaling/swimming movements of extremities\n4.  Apnea\n5.  Autonomic changes: combination of blood pressure changes, tachycardia, in combination with apnea/respiratory changes.\n\nB. Multifocal/focal clonic\n\n1.  Most common overt clinical seizure type in newborns\n2.  Clinical manifestations include rhythmic jerking of one or more body parts\n3.  Not the same as \"generalized tonic-clonic\", which describes convulsive seizures in children/adults\n\nC. Tonic\n\n1.  Clinical manifestations include tonic extension of all limbs, resembling decerebrate posturing, occasionally accompanied by subtle signs (e.g. apnea, eye changes)\n2.  Can be focal or generalized\n\n<a id='bf9623ac-c5a3-4d6a-82cb-cfa37ce6ee43'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Myoclonic\n1. Rare seizure type, occurs primarily in catastrophic epilepsy\n2. Almost always seen in conjunction with very abnormal EEG and exam\n\n<a id='e2d61cff-034d-4ecf-84ba-cf99b667366b'></a>\n\n### III. Etiologies of Neonatal Seizures\n\nA. Acute Symptomatic- About 80% of neonatal seizures are acute symptomatic seizures, meaning they reflect acute brain injury/disturbance. Identifying the underlying cause is key.\n\n1.  **Hypoxic-ischemic injury**: HIE is the most common cause of seizures in first few days or life (50%)\n2.  **Stroke**- 2nd most common cause\n    a. Arterial Ischemic\n    b. Intracranial hemorrhage:\n        i. Subarachnoid: usually otherwise asymptomatic (\"well baby with seziures\")\n        ii. Intraventricular: associated with prematurity\n        iii. Subdural: associated with traumatic delivery\n    c. Sinovenous thrombosis – may be evident from Doppler flow on HUS or MRV\n3.  **Hypoglycemia**: occurs in association with SGA, IDM, and/or asphyxia.\n4.  **Hypocalcemia**: occurs in association with prematurity, IDM, asphyxia, hypoparathyroidism, DiGeorge/VCF syndrome (22q11.2 deletion), cardiac anomalies.\n5.  **Other electrolyte abnormalities**: hypomagnesemia, hypo/hypernatremia.\n6.  **CNS infection**: meningitis, encephalitis, brain abscess, congenital TORCH, Zika\n7.  **Developmental defects**: cortical dysgenesis\n\n<a id='590c7cef-6981-45c3-a79a-1d588b660b66'></a>\n\nB. **Neonatal Onset Epilepsy**- 20% of neonatal seizures are due to underlying chronic/congenital conditions that are likely to result in ongoing epilepsy. When MRI is normal and no cause of acute symptomatic seizures is found, >50% of babies will have a confirmed genetic diagnosis if testing is performed.\n\n1.  **Genetic & Metabolic syndromes**: includes benign familial neonatal seizures due to KCNQ2 or other mutations, inborn errors of metabolism, pyridoxine-dependent seizures, DEND (developmental delay, epilepsy, and neonatal diabetes).\n2.  **Brain malformation syndromes**\n\n<a id='119847bb-aeda-4f74-9edf-53751804f000'></a>\n\nIV. **Evaluation**\n\nA. Acute diagnostic tests: check STAT electrolytes, Ca, glucose, Mg:\nB. Electrolytes\n\n<a id='7492ec97-9fb9-4d6f-9bad-0d75a5e68fe2'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

If hypoglycemic (<40 mg/dl), give 2-3 ml/kg D10W IVP then start or increase IV glucose infusion to give at least 7-8 mg/kg/min.\n2. If hypocalcemic, give 10-20 mg/kg Calcium chloride IV push.\n3. If hypomagnesemic give 25-50 mg/kg Magnesium sulfate IV.\n\n**C. First line diagnostic tests** include:\n1. CBC\n2. Urine Toxic Screen\n3. Complete Metabolic Panel\n4. Lactate\n5. Blood culture\n6. Head ultrasound- Head Ultrasound is useful for excluding hemorrhage and for initial images while awaiting MRI, and for serial imaging. EEG electrodes are not a contraindication to HUS- it can be performed by moving one electrode, and does not require discontinuing VEEG.\n\n**D. Head imaging** – Indicated as soon as possible (when baby stable and MRI available) for neonates with seizures. It will provide a diagnosis in ~90% of cases of neonatal seizures. MRI is preferred for resolution and multidimensional imaging and possibility of MRA and MRV. Head CT should be used very rarely, when immediate imaging is needed and neither HUS nor MRI is possible.\n\n**E. Revisit family history** after parents have checked with family; often new information comes out after a baby has seizures.\n\n**F. Additional tests to consider** (depending on clinical situation)\n1. Lumbar puncture - to rule out infection (bacterial & viral studies), hemorrhage. Send glucose with a paired serum glucose sample. If possible, consider sending additional CSF test (below) from LP, or saving CSF for additional studies\n2. TORCH titers & Zika\n3. ABG\n4. Ammonia, lactate with paired pyruvate\n5. Serum amino acids, urine organic acids, acylcarnitine profile, free/total carnitine.\n\n**G. Testing for Genetic/Metabolic causes** Genetic testing identifies the cause of neonatal seizures in >50% of neonates at LPCH who have seizures but normal MRI, and may influence treatment choice. Discuss with neurology to select those tests relevant to the individual patient.\n1. Serum biotinidase, uric acid, acylcarnitine panel, carnitine (free and total), very long chain fatty acids, pipecolic acid. alpha-AASA, guanidinoacetate/creatine\n2. Urine – sulfocysteine, alpha-AASA, guanidinoacetate/creatine, pyr/pur panel\n\n<a id='8b09ad0a-b86a-4026-8697-d4ab6e128181'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

If multiple boluses have been given, follow drug levels and begin maintenance when levels begin to fall (this may take several days).\n1. Phenobarbital: Maintenance dose 4-5 mg/kg/day given QD or BID.\n2. Fosphenytoin: Maintenance dose 5 mg/kg/day divided TID. (Therapeutic levels are extremely difficult to maintain with PO dosing—rarely continued beyond a few days.)\n3. Levetiracetam: Maintenance dose 40-80 mg/kg/day divided TID. Levels are not usually measured.\nB. Duration of maintenance therapy will depend on individual circumstances. In general, children with acute symptomatic seizures (e.g. in perinatal arterial stroke) are often able to stop seizure medicines prior to NICU discharge, while those with genetic or metabolic conditions may require lifelong treatment.\nC. All patients discharged on anti-seizure medicines should have a follow-up visit with a pediatric neurologist 4-6\n\n<a id='8a5df8d6-35ce-475f-b31a-2a785840fb48'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

The incidence of IVH in premature infants has declined in the past 20 yrs from 40% of all premature births to around 25%, in part due to antenatal steroid administration. The incidence increases with decreasing gestational age. IVH becomes much more common at <28 wks gestation and is rare after 34 wks gestation. If an IVH is to occur, the early stages are detected in 90% of infants before 4 days of age and 99% by 10 days of age. Extension of IVH occurs typically by 2-4 wks of age.\n\n<a id='fbc49bbb-346b-432e-bebc-2ca7a5a05943'></a>\n\n## II. Etiology\n\nIVH in the premature infant arises from the germinal matrix (GM). This is a periventricular structure located between the caudate nucleus and the thalamus. It contains a fine vascular network devoid of supportive stroma. The GM undergoes a progressive decrease in size as gestational age increases, with nearly complete involution by approximately 36 wks. As preterm infants are at high risk for impaired cerebrovascular autoregulation, a host of factors (e.g., anemia, volume resuscitation, pneumothorax, CPR, hypercarbia, and acidosis), whose common endpoint is abnormally increased cerebral blood flow, leads to rupture of the delicate blood vessels of the GM. Also implicated as potential etiologies are infection/inflammation that can affect vessel fragility, changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) that may occur with PDA, and a decrease in CBF that may be associated with hyperventilation and hypocarbia.\n\n<a id='4ee21561-53d8-4194-bb69-50bccbdd27d3'></a>\n\n### III. Classification of IVH\n\nA. The Papile ultrasound grading system has historically been used (somewhat imperfectly) to predict long-term neurologic outcome, risk for hydrocephalus, and survival.\n\n1. Grade I: Bleeding limited to the subependymal or germinal matrix layer and the choroid plexus.\n2. Grade II: Bleeding extending into the ventricles that may fill the ventricle but not cause dilation.\n3. Grade III: Bleeding into the ventricles that directly causes dilatation of the ventricles but no extension into brain parenchyma. This should be distinguished from Grade II with subsequent post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus.\n4. Grade IV: Bleeding that extends into the brain parenchyma.\n\n<a id='51353460-8e8b-437a-b875-1e50447d6fbe'></a>\n\nB. More recently at LPCH, radiologists have chosen to describe the constellation of findings seen on cranial ultrasound including location and size of any bleeding, dilatation (or narrowing) of ventricles, and any evidence of edema or any structural abnormalities that are appreciated. Intraparenchymal echodensity may also be used to describe a periventricular hemorrhagic infarction (PVHI), which rather than a traditional Grade IV extension of bleeding into the parenchyma, instead reflects obstruction of venous flow and venous infarction. It is important to review findings with a radiologist to distinguish these differences for better prognostication. In addition, there may be documentation of the resistive index (RI) of the middle cerebral artery:\n\nRI = (Peak systolic velocity - End diastolic velocity)/ (Peak systolic velocity)\n\n<a id='3c8ae7ce-e29f-4811-9dca-55661a0fa25f'></a>\n\nRI of less than 0.5-0.6 in the neonatal period is associated with adverse neurological outcomes at 1-2 yrs of age. High RI may indicate increased intracranial pressure. RI may also be affected by the presence of a PDA or other cardiac anomalies.\n\n<a id='fe721191-d029-4883-bd1d-733a64642964'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

It may present asymptomatically or with severe neurologic signs such as lethargy or seizures. It may be reflected by a drop in hematocrit, hypotension or by metabolic acidosis. Some longer-term effects include:\n\n<a id='13acce16-0656-40b8-aaef-f4ad752c6edb'></a>\n\nA. Post hemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH) occurs in up to 1/3-1/2 of patients with grade III or IV IVH, but occurs rarely in less severe IVH. The hallmarks are progressive ventricular dilatation and abnormal increase in OFC. Treatment can include close monitoring, serial LPs, ventriculostomy, and mechanical shunting depending upon response to non-surgical management and/or the presence of signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure. Signs of increased ICP in the neonate include: OFC increase >1-1.5 cm/wk, tense anterior fontanelle, cranial suture separation or neurologic signs such as decreased alertness, apnea, seizures or sun-setting (downward gaze of eyes). aEEG monitoring may demonstrate increased discontinuity and loss of sleep-wake cycling with progressive hydrocephalus.\n\nB. Periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) is a generally symmetric, non-hemorrhagic, and ischemic white matter injury of the premature brain. As premature infants have relatively pressure-passive blood-brain barrier integrity, changes in systemic BP may be more likely to lead to changes in CBF with resultant PVL. It leads to necrosis in the periventricular white matter and secondary enlargement of the lateral ventricles. This disorder is often associated with IVH and with factors that predispose to IVH. Cytokine-mediated inflammation may also play a distinct role in the development of PVL. PVL is commonly associated with neurologic handicap (primarily the spastic diplegia form of cerebral palsy). It can be diagnosed most reliably by MRI but can also be detected in most cases by ultrasound as periventricular echodensities or cystic lesions.\n\nC. Neuromotor sequelae: Major IVH is associated strongly with neuromotor handicaps ranging from minor to severe. Definite neurologic sequelae are seen in 25-50% of cases with severe grade III & IV, but in only 5- 15% of grade I to II hemorrhage (which is about the same rate as preterm infants without identified IVH). However, recent literature suggests that even grade I to II IVH may lead to increased risks for neurodevelopmental impairment. Infants with bilateral IVH or those who require a shunt are at significantly higher risk for neurologic sequelae.\n\n<a id='9b1a95cf-109b-401b-bdf4-44c5b48aab7f'></a>\n\nV. **Diagnosis of IVH**\n\nA. Cranial ultrasound:\n\n1. A screening head ultrasound is indicated for infants with a birth weight <1500 grams and/or gestational age < 32 weeks at 7-10 days of age. Earlier scanning may be indicated by clinical suspicion and/or when withdrawal of intensive care support is being considered. A screening head ultrasound may also be indicated for infants of higher birth weight or gestational age, depending on the clinical scenario (e.g. twin-twin transfusion, need for CPR, or significant clinical instability).\n2. No follow-up is recommended for minimally abnormal head ultrasound (Grade I or II) after 1 week of age.\n3. Patients with a significant bleeding into the ventricle (i.e., grade II or III) may need at least 1 subsequent cranial ultrasound to evaluate for post-hemorrhagic ventricular dilatation that may evolve into post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus.\n4. Follow-up may be indicated for critically ill patients or ELBW (<750 gm) at the discretion of the attending.\n5. Weekly measures of OFC should be performed on all patients, with more frequent measurements on those patients with severe IVH.\n6. Infants with severe IVH (grade III or IV) are at higher risk for clinical or subclinical seizures, and aEEG monitoring for minimum of 24 h should be performed to screen for epileptic activity.

Serial ultrasounds have been recommended for all patients in the past with IVH; however, serial ultrasounds (every 5-10 days) should be reserved for those infants with the following risk factors:\n\n1. Clinical signs of increased ICP.\n2. Severe IVH on initial scan.\n3. Patient receiving ongoing interventions (e.g., medication, LP) to assess efficacy of therapy.\n\n<a id='b560f58b-be9a-4772-866c-f56a228df8a6'></a>\n\nVI. \"Premature\" MRI Protocol\n\nA. Recent developments in MR imaging (e.g., diffusion-weighted imaging and diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI and DWI)) allow for better quantification of brain size and myelinization. MRI is likely the most sensitive and accurate modality for imaging PVL. We try to obtain DTI/DWI in all premature infants once they are >35-36 wks corrected gestational age. This is usually best done when they are stable in an open crib and requiring no more than supplemental oxygen for respiratory support. Besides premature infants (BW <1500 gm or GA<32 weeks), other babies at high risk for CNS injury (e.g. infants with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, metabolic disorder, or post-ECMO support) may also be candidates for an MRI study.\n\nB. Infants needing an MRI usually are done as a \"feed and bundle\" (feed the infant just prior to and swaddle them during the scan). If this is unsuccessful, then the infant must be rescheduled. With second attempt, infant should be made NPO and sedation given. This must be done per the moderate sedation protocol. The infant must never be given sedation without being NPO for an MRI. The Pediatric Anesthesia Service may be consulted for those patients needing sedation.\n\n<a id='699c4ea2-6cf5-49b3-9827-be1be5658579'></a>\n\nReferences:\n\n1. Papile LA et al.

Definition\n\nRetinopathy of prematurity (ROP) refers to the abnormal growth of blood vessels in the retina of premature infants. The incidence of ROP increases with decreasing gestational age and lower birth weight. In its most severe state, ROP leads to scarring and retinal detachment, and subsequently visual impairment and blindness.\n\n<a id='0a5d43f5-43d1-43f4-9f50-f00d32140ffe'></a>\n\nII. **Etiology**\n\nROP is a multifactorial disease. The most important risk factor for developing ROP is prematurity. Several other risk factors have been identified, such as: low birth weight; oxygen use; assisted ventilation for over one week; severity of illness; high blood transfusion volume; and hyperglycemia. 1-5 Elevated arterial oxygen tension with paO2 > 80 mm Hg is thought to contribute to development of ROP, but the SUPPORT trial demonstrated increased risk of mortality in infants exposed to lower O2 saturation goals in attempts to reduce ROP.\n\n<a id='02b4c5cc-d400-4cd0-9d00-7ff630dd9b32'></a>\n\n### III. Classification of ROP\n\nClassification of ROP is based on staging of the disease (stage 1-5), location of involvement of the retina (Zone I-III), extent of retinal involvement (1-12 clock hours), and presence or absence of plus disease.\n\n#### A. Stage\n\n1.  Stage 1: Flat white line demarcating the vascular and avascular retina\n2.  Stage 2: Formation of a ridge of fibrous tissue between the vascular and avascular retina\n3.  Stage 3: Growth of new blood vessels and fibrous tissue along the ridge and into the vitreous\n4.  Stage 4: Partial retinal detachment\n5.  Stage 5: Total retinal detachment\n\n<a id='68b68ff4-0d50-4432-afaa-face06388899'></a>\n\nB. Zones\n<::Diagram of the left eye showing concentric zones and anatomical landmarks.

Prevention\n\nInterventions to prevent ROP have been largely unsuccessful or associated with other adverse outcomes. Prompt detection and treatment is the best way to preserve vision.\n\nA. PaO2 ≥80 mm Hg in the first 2 wks of life has been shown to increase the risk of development of severe ROP, however decreased target oxygenation saturation has been associated with increased mortality.\n\nB. In the STOP-ROP trial infants were maintained with O2 sats either 89-94% (conventional) or 96-99% (supplemental). Although there was a trend towards a decrease in conversion from prethreshold to threshold ROP in the supplemental group, the results were not statistically significant. However, in the group with no Plus disease, there was a statistically significant benefit in infants in the supplemental group (46% vs 32%). However, supplemental oxygen increased the risk of adverse pulmonary events.\n\nC. In the SUPPORT and BOOST II trials infants were maintained with O2 sats 85-89% (low sat arm) or 91-95% (high sat arm). ROP was reduced in the low sat arm (85-89%) however, the risk of death was higher. The BOOST II trial also found a higher rate of NEC in the low sat arm.\n\nD. In the LPCH NICU, infants who reach prethreshold stage 2 or 3 ROP are managed with a combination of increased oxygen saturation levels (97-100%), correction of anemia (Hct ≥40%) and exposure to room light (i.e. removing the cover on the isolette to reduce rod photoreceptor oxygen consumption). These interventions aim to down-regulate pathologically elevated levels of VEGF.\n\n<a id='90b4dcde-eca2-4e0b-b6fd-c2cf44de7640'></a>\n\n**VIII.

Avastin (Bevacizumab)\n\nIntravitereal injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy such as Avastin have become a new treatment modality for ROP10 as it is a shorter procedure with need for only topical anesthesia versus intubation and sedation needed for laser therapy. A multicenter randomized controlled trial BEAT-ROP11 also demonstrated a reduced recurrence of ROP at 54 weeks when compared to laser treatment for zone I ROP and decreased rates of severe high myopia at 2.5 years. Laser therapy may still be required if patients do not respond to the injection, or if ROP worsens after the injection.\n\nRecently, concerns have been raised about systemic absorption of Avastin and potential harmful effects on developing tissues, specifically the brain. A recent study by the Canadian Neonatal Network12 showed that premature infants treated with Avastin had higher odds of severe neurodevelopmental disabilities at 18 months, and a statistically significantly lower Bayley motor composite score. Caution should be used when deciding between treatment with Avastin versus laser therapy.\n\n<a id='10c4271d-cfbb-4a06-b754-008a676e49dc'></a>\n\nXI. **Ophthalmology Consultants**\n\nA.

CSF pathway:\n\n1.  CSF is produced in the choroid plexus and cerebral tissue.\n    a. Normal rate of CSF production is about 18mL/hour.\n2.  CSF circulates through the ventricular system into the subarachnoid space.\n    Lateral ventricles → foramen of Monro midline →3rd ventricle → aqueduct of Sylvius → 4th ventricle → to subarachnoid spaces via paired lateral foramina of Luschka and midline foramen of Magendie.\n3.  There are large areas within the subarachnoid space called cisterns where CSF collects.\n    a. Basal cisterns connect the intracranial and spinal subarachnoid spaces.\n\n<::Lateral ventricules\nThird ventricule\nAcqueduc of Sylvius\nForamen of Monroe\nFourth ventricule\nForamen (openings) of\nLuschke and Magendie\n: figure::>\n\n<a id='0dac99c0-8be8-4742-af89-5b91747d6b0f'></a>\n\nB. Hydrocephalus is an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the ventricles of the brain or subarachnoid spaces. It can be congenital (about 1 out of 1000 live births). Common causes of congenital hydrocephalus include aqueductal stenosis, spina bifida, arachnoid cysts, Dandy-Walker syndrome and Chiari malformation. Common causes of acquired hydrocephalus include intraventricular hemorrhage, brain tumors, infection or head trauma.\n\n1.  Non-communicating hydrocephalus or obstructive hydrocephalus: blockage within the CSF pathway or within the subarachnoid spaces.\n    a. Most common is aqueductal stenosis. The aqueduct of Sylvius is the narrow pathway between the 3rd and 4th ventricle. A child may be born with abnormally narrowed aqueduct or aqueductal webbing. It can also be blocked from infection, hemorrhage or from a tumor. This results in enlargement of the lateral and 3rd ventricles.\n2.  Communicating hydrocephalus: impaired reabsorption of CSF within the arachnoid villi, basal cisterns, and subarachnoid spaces. A rare cause of CSF overproduction can occur with choroid plexus papilloma.\n\n<a id='4e44479a-cda5-4478-8f0d-26b7161be70e'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Clinical signs include:\n\n1.  Rapidly increasing head circumference in a child with patent cranial sutures\n2.  Full, bulging fontanel that can be soft or tense. It does not fluctuate with position or when the child is calm.\n3.  Disconjugate gaze or sunsetting sign of the eyes (upgaze paresis).\n4.  Increase sleepiness, difficult to arouse, lethargic\n5.  Nausea/vomiting with no other associated illness or causes.\n6.  Failure to thrive\n7.  Slow development\n\nB. Diagnostic Studies\n\n1.  Head ultrasound\n2.  Brain MRI\n    a. Full brain MRI without contrast often for initial study\n    b. Full brain MRI with and without contrast if a mass is noted\n    c. Head CT often for acute symptoms or patients with adjustable valve\n3.  Follow up study: Fast brain MRI without contrast (limited sequences that can be done within minutes, no sedation needed). Does not require patient to be NPO.\n\n<a id='f0891306-565f-4333-b05e-dd44fdda854b'></a>\n\n### III. Management of Hydrocephalus in the Neonate\n\nA. Ventricular reservoir is a ventricular access device (VAD) used as a bridge to VP shunt in neonates who are too small for VP shunt or have other medical issues that need to be addressed.\n\n1. A VAD can be used for serial therapeutic taps for management of hydrocephalus\n\na. Intraventricular hemorrhage: while waiting for the CSF to clear from the hemorrhage, remove elevated protein and debris.\n\nb. Use as temporary management of symptoms while continuing to evaluate need for VP shunt.\n\nB. Endoscopic Third Ventriculostomy (ETV) and Choroid Plexus Cauterizaton (CPC)\n\n1. Alternative to CSF shunting in infants with hydrocephalus\n\n2. ETV: use of endoscopy to create an internal pathway for CSF diversion through the floor of the third ventricle. This procedure allows the ventricular CSF to bypass anatomic obstructions and directly enter, and be absorbed through, the subarachnoid space via the hole created in the floor of the third ventricle.\n\n<a id='762ddcf7-a575-4505-8a71-6c29d524962f'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

About 30% of children do not respond well to the procedure and subsequently require a shunt.\nSuccess rate is higher in children older than 1 year of age.\n\n<a id='71da0026-fb53-48a5-914e-54a43f3587ab'></a>\n\n3.\nb. Deficient CSF resorption is thought to attribute to low ETV success rate in young infants.\nCPC: endoscopic cauterization of the choroid plexus at time of ETV can augment the deficient CSF resorption\n\n<a id='59e89480-448d-41de-859b-aa29d3065bfe'></a>\n\nC. Ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VP shunt):\n1. Components of shunt:\n   a. Proximal catheter is radiopaque and placed in one of the lateral ventricles.\n   b. The valve allows for unidirectional CSF flow and contains a reservoir that allows evaluation of ICP and sampling of CSF.\n   c. Distal catheter end is primarily placed into the peritoneum or, if clinically indicated, in other absorptive cavities such as the atrium or pleural space.\n      i. Ventriculoperitoneal shunt\n      ii. Ventriculopleural shunt\n      iii. Ventriculo atrial shunt\n\n<a id='bb9efe9a-9109-46da-99c3-ee39265eccee'></a>\n\n## IV. Shunt Valve Types\n\nA. Fixed-pressure (nonprogrammable) valve regulates the flow of CSF based on a pre-determined pressure setting.\n    1. Necessitates shunt revision when the patient's pressure/flow requirement changes\n\nB. Adjustable pressure (programmable) valve regulates the flow of CSF based on a pressure setting that can be adjusted with a powerful external magnetic device. An MRI scan can change the setting of a programmable shunt and requires Neurosurgery Service to check the setting of valve after the MRI scan is completed. There are now adjustable valves that are compatible with MRI up to 3.0 Tesla.\n\n<a id='cd71ac4e-a36d-478e-b04a-abc730574c8c'></a>\n\nV. **Complications**\n\nA. Shunt Failure – obstruction along any portion of the shunt system. Insufficient or over drainage with current valve.\n\nB. Disconnection – usually neck area, often in cervical junction with longstanding shunts, should be able to palpate area of disconnection and fluid along the shunt tract. Shunt series plain film x-ray can help evaluate for disconnections.\n\nC. Migration – catheter migrates out of ventricle or out of peritoneal space (inguinal hernia).\n\nD. Infection – may require externalization of the shunt to a drain until infection is treated.\n\n   1. Meningitis – literature indicates two-thirds of cases caused by S. epidermidis and S. aureus\n\n<a id='5fde8adc-fc28-40a2-9025-b6da97ac20f3'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

On rare occasion, infection can occur from a ruptured appendix or ruptured abdominal viscera\n\nE. Underdrainage or Overdrainage - Both can result in similar symptoms.\n\n   1. Overdrainage - When too much CSF is drained compared with the amount of CSF being produced, the cortical mantle can collapse causing subdural fluid collections. Subdural fluid can cause acute hematoma and cause a life-threatening situation, especially in the infant with small blood volumes and large heads. For older children who can describe their headaches, headaches are worse with upright position and better flat.\n\n   2. Underdrainage - can cause recurrent hydrocephalus. Headaches are worse when flat and better upright.\n\n   3. Loculations - usually caused by infection or ventriculitis, causing catheter occlusion, and will result in increased ICP.\n\n<a id='870b03c2-310b-4f8d-9d56-ef90c7d2762c'></a>\n\nVI. **Management of an Infected Shunt in the Neonate**\n\nA. Obtain CSF culture (aerobic/anaerobic) and gram stain, serial blood cultures, urine culture, CBC with differential, CRP CP ESR.\n\nB. Initiate broad spectrum antibiotics.\n\nC. Once organism is isolated and antibiotic sensitivities are available, adjust antibiotics as indicated.\n\nD. Externalize shunt or remove shunt completely, monitoring head circumference and signs of increased ICP.\n\n<a id='53cdcbf0-163c-44fa-b2f0-b7595241c408'></a>\n\n## VII. Tapping a Ventricular Reservoir\n\nA. Performed only by Neurosurgery Team\n\nB. Equipment: 25-gauge butterfly needles, syringe, sterile gloves, betadine prep, gauze and mask.\n\nC. For patients requiring interval tapping: obtain surveillance head ultrasound every Monday and Thursday, to monitor ventricle size AND weekly full CSF panel.\n\n<a id='dcdb6aa6-d0fd-487a-9afb-c04463e4ccd4'></a>\n\nVIII. **Daily Nursing Considerations/Management**\n\nA. Daily head circumference measurement.\n\nB. Assess fontanels routinely in an upright position and when infant is not irritable.\n\nC. Routine vital signs, including temperature.\n\nD. Monitor for signs and symptoms of increased ICP: nausea, vomiting, lethargy, irritability, disconjugate gaze, any change in mental status, and depressed respiratory status.\n\nE. Assess entire shunt tract for fluid collection, erythema, and tenderness.\n\nF. Rotate head every 2-3 hours and avoid direct pressure to VP shunt to prevent skin breakdown.\n\nG. Typically a fast brain MRI without contrast is done after a VP shunt placement for baseline ventricle size.\n\n<a id='e804721b-13b0-4c2b-bd65-7a97cceb436e'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Consult with Neurosurgery Team prior to discharging patient.\n\nB. Family should have instructions on signs and symptoms to look for.\n\nC. Follow-up is often 2 weeks after hospital discharge for ETV/CPC or complicated patients and 3-4 weeks for other patients. Patients may need a head ultrasound or fast MRI prior to clinic appointment.\n\nD. VP shunt patients who live far away should be discharged with a copy of most recent neuroimaging scan in case of an emergency.

OVERVIEW\n\nTherapeutic hypothermia is now the standard of care for newborns with moderate to severe HIE identified at less than 6 hours of age. A meta-analysis of 1214 infants enrolled in 7 trials concluded that reduction in body temperature to 33-34° C in infants ≥36 weeks gestation with moderate to severe HIE results in significant reductions in the risk of death or major neurodevelopmental disability at 18 months of age (RR 0.76 95% CI 0.69-0.84) and an increase in the rate of survival with normal neurologic function.1 The number need to treat (NNT) is 7. The reduction in death or major neurodevelopmental disability was greatest in those with moderate HIE (RR 0.67 95% CI 0.56-0.81) when compared with those with severe HIE (RR 0.83 95% CI 0.74-0.92). The reduction in adverse outcomes was very similar for total body hypothermia and selective head cooling. Side effects of cooling are limited to bradycardia and thrombocytopenia, however neither is clinically significant. There is a higher rate of PPHN in cooled infants however the difference is not statistically significant but may be clinically important.2,3\n\n<a id='842f0e9a-ba13-4ca6-b0ce-9fab56291d84'></a>\n\nAt LPCH more than 75% of our neonates who undergo therapeutic hypothermia are transported to our NICU from referring hospitals. During transport to LPCH, a portable cooling device (Tecotherm Neo) is utilized to initiate active cooling prior to admission to LPCH. Most patients reach target temperature prior to arriving at LPCH.\n\n<a id='1c988323-e7cd-4fe1-b123-cc489d5688ff'></a>\n\nThe Late Hypothermia trial enrolled newborns with moderate to severe encephalopathy who had cooling initiated at 6-24 hours of age. Infants were randomized to cooling for **96 hours** to a temperature of 33-34°C or to control. Bayesian analysis indicates that there is benefit; however, this benefit was less than that if treated by 6 hours after birth. Late Hypothermia provides a 76% chance of a lower rate of death or disability, but the extent of the benefit is uncertain. Given there are no other treatments available and the risks associated with this therapy are minimal, we recommend performing therapeutic hypothermia on qualifying infants.\n\n<a id='bb82f4a8-6ff8-428e-a9a1-41d4427c9d1a'></a>\n\nII. **ACTIVE TRIALS FOR NEWBORNS WITH HIE AT LPCH.** Please page research @15340 as soon as a potential HIE study patient is identified (i.e. at the time transport is accepted). For study-specific enrollment criteria, please consult the reminder cards distributed by research or the NICU attending office bulletin board.\n\nA. A Randomized Trial of Targeted Temperature Management with Whole Body Hypothermia for Moderate and Severe Neonatal Encephalopathy in Premature Infants 33-25 Weeks Gestational Age-A Bayesian Study (Preemie Cooling)\n\nPreemie Cooling will determine if whole body cooling will improve survival and reduce disability in babies with HIE born at 330/7 to 356/7 weeks, presenting within 6 hours of birth. Patients will be randomized to an intervention arm with a temperature of 33.5°C for 72 hours or to a control arm with temperatures 36.5°-37.3°C with active intervention for temperatures >37.3°C.\n\nB. High Dose Erythropoietin for Asphyxia and Encephalopathy (HEAL)\n\nHEAL is a trial of high-dose erythropoietin vs. placebo in term babies with HIE who are being cooled clinically (33.5C for 72h) to determine if the rates of death or moderate/severe motor or cognitive deficits can be reduced.\n\n<a id='1d306dc1-c5f5-466b-9ac2-e75f4df7bcaa'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

The following documents are located in the binders in the side pocket of the Blanketrol III devices in the NICU: Complete Cooling Document for Referring Hospitals, Hypothermia Algorithm, Blanketrol III Quickstart Guide, Blanketrol III Troubleshooting Tips, and RN to RN Handoff.\n\n<a id='3255b7eb-efc1-49cc-8da5-d399fb8e412e'></a>\n\nVI. THERAPEUTIC HYPOTHERMIA\n\nA. After placement of the esophageal probe the infant is placed on the cooling blanket. Radiographic confirmation of the correct position of the esophageal probe (lower 1/3 of esophagus) must be obtained. See Hypothermia Algorithm and Quickstart Guide located in Blanketrol binder for therapeutic hypothermia induction and maintenance phases of cooling.\n\nB. Core body temperature is continuously monitored and servo-regulated using the esophageal temperature probe.\n\nC. During induction of cooling the entire baby's body (including the head) is placed directly on the cooling mattress until the target temperature (33-34° C or 31.5-32.5° C) is reached.\n\n<a id='485a8951-9806-4670-94f1-0a43a8c59746'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

After the infant reaches target temperature the head should rest on a covered gel pillow and does not come in direct contact with the cooling blanket. Instead the cooling blanket remains in direct contact with the rest of the infant's body, beginning at the shoulders.\n\nE. Core body temperature maintained for 72 hours for clinical hypothermia. If the infant's core temperature drifts out of range (<33°C or > 34 °C) refer to Troubleshooting Sheet in Blanketrol binder.\n\nF. At the conclusion of the cooling period, the patient is rewarmed slowly at a rate of 0.5°C per hour. See Quickstart Guide in Blanketrol Binder for rewarming and post- treatment care.\n\n<a id='ed8af44c-2b29-4452-9ead-e59bacc7f49f'></a>\n\nVII. **PATIENT CARE DURING COOLING**\n\nA. The infant bed is used for monitoring skin temp only. Expect skin temp to be 1-2° cooler than esophageal temperature.\nB. Infant is cared for in the supine position and log-rolled side to side during treatment.\nC. All blood gases are run on a special I-stat, which is calibrated to the core body temperature of 33-34°C. The usual I-stat instrument is calibrated to normal body temperature so it cannot be used. The blood gases during cooling are NOT yet available in EPIC.\nD. Ventilator gases are warmed normally.\nE. Expect lower heart rates. Monitor patient for skin alteration.\nF. Refer to the NICU Hypothermia Order Set in EPIC and the LPCH Intranet \"Nursing Policy and Procedures\" for the details of patient management.\nG. Order continuous video EEG and request a Neurology consult. NICU medical provider must page the on call Neurology resident to request vEEG and to confirm timing of vEEG placement.\n\n<a id='f3c4e90f-1b63-486f-83af-c554fc1c7c89'></a>\n\nVIII. **STANDARDIZING WORKFLOW**\n\nA. Utilize Hypothermia Order Set in EPIC\n\n1. STAT head ultrasound with resistive indices on admission prior to vEEG placement\n\n2. Pre and post ductal saturations monitoring during the first 24 hours of admission\n\n3. vEEG\n\n4. Neurology consult\n\nB. Contact Neurology upon arrival of patient. Confirm start time for vEEG. If vEEG cannot be placed **within 2 hours of admission NICU fellow to initiate aEEG monitoring via placing needle electrodes**. All babies admitted for cooling should be on either aEEG or vEEG within 2 hours of admission to the LPCH NICU.\n\nC. Page Research Coordinator ASAP if eligible for study (i.e. Preemie Cooling, HEAL)\n\nD. Implement Seizure Management Protocol (on intranet) as clinically indicated.\n\nE. Include qualifying information for cooling in H&P. For all outborn infants utilize Transport HIE Worksheet to capture pertinent clinical findings/data related to cooling eligibility or ineligibility (clinical history, biochemical markers, encephalopathy exam).\n\n<a id='52a90448-92e0-4047-8c66-850be5db7ed3'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Utilize Holding Algorithm to determine if infant is eligible for holding during maintenance phase of cooling.\n\nB. After 72 hours of cooling is complete, infant should be gradually rewarmed over at least 7 hours. Avoid\ntemperatures > 37.0°C.\n\nC. Continuous vEEG should occur during induction phase, maintenance phase, and throughout rewarming\nphase. Ideally, vEEG should continue until 24 hours after rewarmed; however, once the patient has been\nrewarmed vEEG may be discontinued at the discretion of Neurology. Consider asking EEG tech to leave\nCerebral and Parietal electrodes in place when removing vEEG in order to continue neuromonitoring via\naEEG on OBM/Moberg/BRM equipment.\n\nD. All patients undergoing therapeutic hypothermia need to have a brain MRI. Include \"therapeutic hypothermia\nprotocol\" and/or \"HEAL Protocol\" when entering MRI order in EPIC. Optimal timing of MRI depends on goals\nof MRI. If one is seeking the highest sensitivity for timing of injury (i.e. whether it was perinatal), early\nscanning at 24-96 hours makes sense. Later scanning at 7-21 days allows for the highest sensitivity for\nextent of injury (i.e. for prognosis); yet the later the scan the worse the sensitivity is for ascertaining timing of\ninjury. Current practice at LPCH is to perform a single scan at day of life 5 to 7. An MRI at this time gives\nthe best trade off between sensitivity for timing of injury and sensitivity for determining extent of injury for\nprognosis.6\n\n<a id='4c8aca64-34d8-4810-8e01-20fb13f06958'></a>\n\nX. **OUTPATIENT FOLLOW UP**\n\nA. All infants who are cooled should be referred to High Risk Infant Follow (HRIF) Clinic at 4 months age.\n\nB. All infant who are cooled (with and without seizures) should be offered outpatient Neurology follow up. Those with seizures should have follow up 6 weeks after hospital discharge and those without seizures 4-6 months post hospital discharge. Families may choose to decline but it should be offered and documented in the discharge summary.\n\n<a id='7cad12fa-f3d3-4d23-9c01-6e91089c67c6'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Introduction\n\nThe goals of this chapter are: 1) to help you prevent, recognize and distinguish pain from other distressing symptoms; 2) to describe how pain is measured; and 3) to offer options for care that can improve your patient's comfort while in the NICU.\n\n<a id='a0d12698-cafa-4910-808f-8e8ec94c5d7b'></a>\n\nII. **Background**\n\nA. As recently as the late 1970s, it was commonplace to perform surgery on neonates without benefit of anesthesia or analgesia. Although this might sound surprising, there was little known at the time about the pain experiences of neonates, infants, and other non-verbal children. Clinicians thought non-verbal children were incapable of feeling pain, and that they were not able to remember it. Concerns were also frequently raised about the possible adverse effects of pain medications, since they had not yet been evaluated in this population.\n\nB. We now have good evidence for the presence of a predictable stress response to painful interventions in neonates, and can offer treatments to prevent and mitigate this with better knowledge for their potential risks and benefits. The work of Anand et al. (1985) was instrumental in demonstrating that neonates mount a stress response to surgery consisting of detrimental hormonal, metabolic, and cardiovascular effects, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Further studies have shown that this stress response can be reduced by administration of analgesics.\n\nC. In the developing nervous system, nociceptive pathways are present by 24-26 wks, but inhibitory pathways do not develop until the 3rd trimester. Therefore, it is possible that preemie infants feel MORE pain for a given stimulus than older infants, children, and adults. We are now also aware that infants exposed to painful stimuli exhibit exaggerated pain responses to future painful stimuli, making our attention to pain management in the NICU even more important.\n\n<a id='2b611528-4a25-4898-b6fd-1dd1868d4934'></a>\n\n### III. Assessment of Pain\n\nA. Pain is defined as an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience, associated with actual or potential tissue damage or defined in terms of such damage.\n\nB. Pain is a subjective phenomenon. It is REAL regardless of whether tissue damage can be identified or not.\n\nC. Most importantly for infants, the inability to communicate verbally does not negate the possibility than an individual is experiencing pain and is in need of appropriate pain-relieving treatment.\n\n<a id='28112e62-45e4-438e-bb11-b414b1e24b6c'></a>\n\n## IV. Distinguishing Pain From Common Causes of Distress\n\nA. Common causes of non-painful distress are hunger, feeling too cold or hot, needing a diaper changed, being over stimulated by lights and/or sounds, or wanting to be held/wrapped/rocked.\n\nB. Behavior alone is an unreliable predictor of the cause of pain or distress. For example, a baby may be still and outwardly calm, but with tachycardia and limited movement of one lower extremity as the only signs of pain from a broken leg. On the other hand, some neonates scream, arch, and grimace just to let us know their diaper is wet! When assessing a distressed infant consider if pain or other causes of distress could be occurring, and use this to guide your history-taking, physical exam, and studies you obtain.\n\n<a id='e3380767-1284-4a86-a382-25f5c8ebd699'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Schedule for assessments: with every vital sign, 30 min after a pain management intervention (non-pharmacologic or pharmacologic), and other times pain is suspected to be likely to occur (such as during procedures known to be painful or if the patient is fussy.)\n\nB. There are many tools available to systematically characterize the physiologic changes and/or behavioral markers found to be present for infants. In the LPCH NICU/ICN we use the N-PASS (Neonatal Pain, Agitation & Sedation Scale) because of its ease of use, and because validation and reliability data are available.\n\nC. N-PASS scores are located in the chart under IView Critical Care Detailed, so that you can have access to this information when rounding and planning care for a baby.\n\n   1. The N-PASS pain is scored 0 (no pain) up to 10 (severe/highest pain). Note: negative points are assigned when an infant is being sedated.\n\n   2. Nurses will record pain regularly as described in A above, but if you want to score a baby yourself, here's how: Find the value corresponding to the box in each row that best describes a baby's current state, and add the total of all the rows.\n\n   3. Detailed information about the N-PASS tool can be found at http://www.ilemsc.org/PainMgt/NPASS.pdf.\n\nD. Remember that the pain score is only one element of pain assessment. It is just as important to rule out other causes of distress; characterize the timing, frequency, duration, location, provocative/palliative factors, and effect of any prior interventions on the pain. This information directs further evaluation and treatment.\n\nVI. **Pain Management**\n\nManagement options for pain include prevention as well as treatment of the underlying process causing the pain and distress. When it is not possible to immediately cure or prevent an underlying cause of pain, or when we must have an infant undergo a diagnostic or therapeutic intervention that we know will be painful, we utilize multimodal pain therapy as a strategy to prevent or limit the pain experienced. There is evidence that measurable improvements in pain management occur after implementation of practice guidelines directed at improving pain in NICU populations.\n\nVII. **General Guidelines**\n\nMultimodal therapy means using more than one strategy to prevent, treat, or manage pain. Using multiple non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic methods together improve analgesia over a single intervention alone, and may help to limit unwanted side effects by reducing the total dose needed of an individual medication. This is effective whether the pain is mild, moderate or severe.\n\nA. Non-pharmacologic pain management interventions are helpful alone, in conjunction with each other, and when used with medications. Although the effects of these measures are sometimes minimized by health care practitioners who are not at the bedside, dramatic improvements in infant distress are possible from implementing them. Consider the following:\n\n   1. Prevention (do you REALLY need the information you will obtain from a particular test, or might there be a less painful/invasive way to discover that information or answer your clinical question? Can labs be batched, and obtained by indwelling line or venipuncture rather than multiple heel sticks, which are more painful?)\n\n<a id='edccb801-ece5-4c9c-860a-72ded676fc36'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Encouraging parental physical contact/touch\n3. Providing adequate support for staff RNs so that baby has access to calm caregivers at bedside\n4. Decreasing bright lights and loud sounds\n5. Avoiding tactile over-stimulation, or cluster interventions to allow recovery and rest between them\n6. Choosing non-invasive monitoring over invasive monitoring techniques if possible\n7. Allow resting/sleeping periods for baby to establish and maintain circadian rhythm appropriate for age\n8. Limiting pain from tape removal by avoiding placement on hair, and remove gently with moistening/adhesive remover\n9. Lubricating NG/OG and urinary catheters before insertion\n10. Controling thermal stress by providing for comfortable stable ambient temperature\n11. Using skilled/trained personnel to obtain blood and place IV lines\n12. Use mechanical rather than manual lancets for heel sticks\n13. Comfort measures including: swaddling, containment, facilitated tucking, positioning, nesting, rocking, kangaroo care (skin-to-skin), non-nutritive sucking, breastfeeding, massage, music therapy, and age-appropriate special mattresses are very helpful\n14. Consulting pain service to provide acupuncture/acupressure and massage\n\nPharmacologic interventions for pain management include opiates, non-opiate analgesics (acetaminophen, less likely NSAIDS, sucrose), local anesthetics, and systemic anesthetics with analgesic properties. Non-analgesic adjuvants (anxiolytics and sedatives) are often combined with analgesics and non-pharmacologic strategies to lessen stress and improve a patient's overall experience with a painful event. It is important to realize that no ideal pain medication exists that is universally beneficial and without side effects. Therefore, what follows are general suggestions about when to use them, contraindications to use, side effects to watch for, and guidelines for how to choose a dose. See the Housestaff Manual, or other drug resources for additional information. Seek help from others especially if you are unsure.\n\n<a id='fd1b68b3-dcdc-49b5-80e2-b391701737d6'></a>\n\n1. Opiate medications are very effective for treatment and prevention of moderate to severe pain.\n\n   a. They exhibit no ceiling analgesic effect, so may be increased as tolerance develops, to continue to provide analgesia.\n\n   b. Opiates may be administered by single dose or drip depending on length of time analgesia is needed. Consider 1 or 2 single doses (or more) for a procedure, drips or around-the-clock dosing for at least 48 hrs for post-operative pain and for expected, regular and frequent painful interventions such as those that accompany intubation (e.g., need to reposition, suctioning).\n\n   c. The best routes to use in NICU population include PO, NG/OG, and IV. SC and rectal are not as useful due to variable absorption, transdermal patch doses are too strong for this age group except in specific circumstances (when significant opiate tolerance +/- chronic pain are present), and the intramuscular route is never recommended given that this route is painful and absorption is erratic.\n\n   d. Opiate side effects most important to consider in the NICU include decreased Gl motility (may manifest\n\n<a id='b9563a80-d0d2-479a-b8de-8f8e3518c1e0'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Side\neffects often depend on rate of administration, total dose, other meds causing CNS depression, and\npatient factors such as prematurity or underlying instability of CV or CNS due to concurrent illnesses.\n\n<a id='a317c115-0c7c-4810-b8d7-1750242f603d'></a>\n\ne. Prolonged use leads to physical dependence (similar to that occurring with prolonged steroid use), so, to prevent withdrawal, you must always taper the drug slowly (no more than 10-20% per day) when a patient has regularly used an opiate for 5-7 days or longer.\n\nf. Morphine and fentanyl have been the most used and studied in the NICU population. Therefore, reserve use of hydromorphone, methadone or other opiates, for which pharmacodynamic and safety data are limited, to experienced practitioners such as intensivists, anesthesiologist, or following consultation with the pain team.\n\ni. Morphine\n\na) Morphine is a potent analgesic. Chest wall rigidity is less of a risk, and less tolerance develops than with fentanyl. However, morphine is more sedating than fentanyl and recent multi-center trials reveal 2 reasons to use fentanyl over morphine in 23-26 weekers who are already unstable from a CV standpoint: Morphine may worsen hypotension in this group, and morphine's analgesic efficacy, even with good blood levels, may be questionable.\n\nb) Dosing guidelines to initiate therapy in opiate naive patients (usually safest to start low and go up): 0.025-0.1 mg/kg IV bolus, or orally at 3 times the dose (0.075-0.3 mg/kg) every 6 hrs for infants under 3 mos post delivery, q 4 or more often in infants greater than 3 mos post delivery regardless of gestational age. Titrate to effect but watch for side effects. Drips can begin at 0.01-0.03 mg/kg/h depending on level of respiratory depression and sedation (side effects of the drug) you are also intending to achieve with it. Use with extreme caution in patients with renal failure, as sedating and anti-analagesic metabolites may have slow clearance.\n\nc) Future effects, a common parental and staff concern: Former preterm infants who had received morphine in NICU for pain management and were reevaluated at 8-9 years old showed improved executive functioning, and no adverse effects on somatosensory perception, pain thresholds, incidence of chronic pain or neurological functioning relative to infants that received placebo (de Graaf et al., 2013). For an up to date review of the issues see also Anand KJ 2016\n\n<a id='6786611f-ed18-489e-a3db-cb71cdd5130c'></a>\n\nii. Fentanyl\n\na) Fentanyl is a potent analgesic, that has quicker onset (1-2 min), is shorter acting (1-2 hrs), and has less GI slowing, less hemodynamic instability and less urinary retention than morphine. However, there is a greater risk of chest wall rigidity, especially with rapid infusion (give bolus doses slowly!), and much more frequent acute tolerance to the drug than Morphine.\n\nb) It is lipophilic, so it distributes widely and quickly into fatty tissue and extravascular fluid. This can lead to reduced efficacy with single doses, and it can be difficult to clear the drug from extravascular fluid if given by prolonged infusions.\n\n<a id='e1029ef5-17c3-4252-a2cb-2fec000707b5'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Non-opiate Analgesics are helpful for mild to moderate pain, alone or together with opiate medication.\n\n<a id='51fd6465-b68d-4a2c-9f3f-fe188874a5c0'></a>\n\na. Acetaminophen\n\nAcetaminophen has a mild to moderate analgesic effect by multiple central mechanisms (serotonin descending inhibition and opioidergic, eicosanoid, nitrous oxide, endo-cannabinoid systems), and is usually well tolerated when used within dosing guidelines. No tolerance to the drug develops and there is an added analgesic effect when used with opiates.\n\ni. Analgesic ceiling: Doses beyond those recommended lead to more side effects but not better analgesia, concern for irreversible liver failure with overdose, no anti-inflammatory effect.\n\nii. Dose: Pharmacokinetics not established in preemies <28 wks. Usual dose modified in 2011 by recommendation of FDA over hepatotoxicity concerns in adults, now limit dose to 10-15 mg/kg PO/IV, or 20-30 mg/kg PR every 6 hrs. Maximum daily cumulative doses PO/IV of 40 mg/kg/d for 28-32 wks, and 60 mg/kg/d for infants 32-36 wks GA and FT infants <10 days are suggested although risk/benefit for long term use in neonates has not been established. Consider limiting use if patient has sepsis, dehydration or liver dysfunction.\n\niii. A systematic review of the literature (Ohlsson & Shaw, Cochrane 2015) supports efficacy in managing postoperative pain and lowering total opioid requirement, but not for heel lance or, ROP exams.\n\n<a id='a20ca062-5f9d-4f5c-9136-31e5a180646a'></a>\n\nb. NSAIDS (e.g. ibuprofen, ketorolac)\n\ni. NSAIDS are good mild/moderate analgesics especially in preventing inflammatory pain.\n\nUnfortunately, few studies have assessed risks/benefits in infants less than 6 mos of age, thus there is limited utility of this class of medications for analgesia, although multiple trials have described efficacy for PDA closure.\n\nii. Risks include displacement of bilirubin, renal toxicity and/or alteration of clearance of other drugs through kidneys, gastritis/GI bleeding, platelet dysfunction, premature closure of duct if infant has duct dependent cardiac anatomy. Suggest use only on limited basis as directed by experienced practitioners assessing risks and benefits of use for a particular NICU patient.\n\nc. Sucrose\n\nSucrose is an effective short acting (2-3 minute) analgesic for procedural pain. Thought to act by a combination of endogenous opiate and non-opiate mechanisms.\n\ni. Doses of 24% solution found in multiple studies to decrease cry duration, lower heart rate variability, decrease facial expressions indicative of pain, and decrease pain scores in infants less than 6 mos of age.\n\nii. Use along with non-nutritive sucking (i.e., pacifier) \\u00b1 other analgesics for heel stick, venipuncture, art stick, immunization, circumcision, lumbar puncture, eye exam, dressing change, bladder catheterization, pleural tap/chest tube placement.\n\niii. No known side effects, but postulated could cause hyperglycemia or necrotizing enterocolitis. One study suggested that repeated frequent dosing may have contributed to poor neurobehavioral outcomes later in life in <31 week infants. Do not give to infants <27 wks, <1,000 gm, CV instability on pressor support, PPHN, chemically paralyzed patients, or with poor with peripheral perfusion. Consider risk of administering by this route (transmucosal) to infants who are NPO or\n\n<a id='8d82c322-8025-474e-be2c-f3556c488502'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Dose: Tootsweet® brand is 24% solution, single dose based on weight: 2 drops (0.08ml) in <1,000gm; 5 drops (0.2ml) for 1,000-2,500 gm, 10 drops (0.4ml) if >2,500 gm. MAX 3 doses per painful procedure; 4 procedures/24 hours (therefore do not exceed 12 doses/24 hrs). Administer by dipping pacifier or by syringe into anterior portion of mouth for buccal absorption.\n\n<a id='8456d114-4560-408f-bdb9-169197315d82'></a>\n\nd. Local Anesthetics\n\nLocal anesthetics such as lidocaine and bupivacaine/levo-bupivacaine provide local or regional anesthesia by preventing nerve transmission.\n\ni. Used in our NICU in various forms: topically in cream (LMX-4), for subcutaneous injection or into peripheral nerve locations, via epidural route, IV, IO, or via ETT. Topical may be used for circumcision, venipuncture, arterial puncture, lumbar puncture, PICC line placement, but not effective for heel lance. Injectable form is helpful for diagnostic and surgical procedures including chest tube insertion (local or intercostal block), suturing, circumcision (DPNB or ring block), and IV catheter placement. **Do not use the form that contains epinephrine** on areas with end vascular supply such as digits, penis or pinnae as resulting vasoconstriction could lead to necrosis. Use of local anesthetics delivered via regional block or infusion (e.g. via epidural) is limited to experienced practitioners including Anesthesia, Pain Service, Surgery, and intensivists with knowledge of risks/side effects. In capable hands these are usually well tolerated and very effective in reducing localized pain and thus may dramatically reduce requirements for systemic opiate.\n\nii. Dose: LMX-41/4 inch thick to local area intact skin only, SQ/IM lidocaine injection varies, suggested maximum dose in Housestaff Manual 4.5 mg/kg/2 hrs, epidural bupivacaine/levo-bupivacaine infusion of 0.1% not to exceed 3 ml/kg/h.\n\ne. Ketamine\n\nKetamine is a dissociative anesthetic, with sedative, analgesic, and amnestic properties.\n\ni. Risk of deep sedation/anesthesia, hypoxemia, laryngospasm or apnea. Use at Packard is limited to Anesthesiologists and Intensivists and others under approved sedation protocols only. Studies have shown ketamine to be effective for bronchoscopy in infants; however, it has not been demonstrated to be effective for endotracheal suctioning.\n\nf. Alpha-2 Agonist therapy\n\nClonidine and Dexmedetomidine are central alpha-2 agonist with analgesic properties.\n\ni. Limited data exist regarding pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy in infants. This currently limits more widespread use. Both drugs carry risk for hypotension, and must be titrated and weaned. Used primarily as 1) adjuvant during opioid and benzodiazepine weaning for refractory withdrawal, 2) adjuvant to sedate patients with agitation on mechanical ventilation who are refractory to standard management.\n\nNon-analgesic adjuvants\n\nSedatives and anxiolytic medications are often prescribed to induce sleep for diagnostic procedures, calm irritable infants, or along with analgesics to manage pain related agitation. They are also helpful to relieve agitation during mechanical ventilation, and can suppress patients' central respiratory drive in order to achieve synchrony with the ventilator.\n\n<a id='51943cc8-fe26-41df-a943-5ffb547fb6c8'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Remember, sedation is a continuum from mild sedation/anxiolysis, through moderate and deep sedation to anesthesia. One must be prepared to support a patient's airway, respiratory and cardiovascular systems any time these drugs are used. Be especially cautious when you use >1 medication that can cause sedation—the effect is likely to be more profound than predicted. The effect is often synergic, not simply additive!\n\n<a id='66d0b9dc-1557-469d-b91c-eae3a8d20c21'></a>\n\nb. Benzodiazepines\n\n<a id='46292aa6-7af3-4d96-8f5d-8969eed39405'></a>\n\nMidazolam is the benzodiazepine most studied in the NICU population.\n\ni. Risks include sedation (usually desired), respiratory depression, and hypotension. Short-term neurological complications with prolonged infusions have been reported, and concerns have been raised about relationship to frequency of IVH and PVL in ventilated pre-term neonates. Yet, longer acting benzodiazepines such as lorazepam and diazepam have been little studied and have limiting pharmacologic properties that prolong clearance.\n\nii. Tolerance (needing a higher dose to achieve same effect over time) and dependency (withdrawal syndrome if abruptly stopped after 5-7 days regular use) are factors that must be taken into account in selecting dose and eventual weaning schedule.\n\niii. Dose: 0.05-0.15 mg/kg IV, infusions 0.01-0.06 mg/kg/h not uncommon. Oral dose for short radiologic procedures: 0.25 mg/kg PO.\n\n<a id='e78997a4-79b0-4e97-a872-20b2e9dcaa04'></a>\n\nc. Chloral hydrate\n\nChloral hydrate is a non-analgesic hypnotic primarily used for radiologic procedures. Although clinically effective, it is important to realize that it is metabolized into 2 toxic metabolites with half-lives >72 hrs: trichloroethanol competes for glucoronidation and can worsen hyperbilirubinemia; trichloroacetic acid has been shown to be carcinogenic in mice. Because of these concerns, repeated or regular dosing over long periods of time is not recommended.\n\ni. Dose: 25-50 mg/kg PO/PR.\n\n<a id='d1ae735a-636e-4b1b-b4d9-b9aa0455c019'></a>\n\nVIII. Preventing Pain: What to do for Invasive Procedures\n\nFew realize that painful procedures occur with great regularity in the NICU. In one study, critically ill preterm neonates were found to experience 700 painful procedures by the time of discharge, and as many as 7-17painful procedures in a day! Peak exposure occurs during the first few days of admission, and in those receiving respiratory support. Below you will find recommendations and ideas for various procedures.\n\n<a id='dfd82fbf-a78e-4d87-bf61-949d4be5aaf1'></a>\n\nA.

For the following procedures, consider sucrose and pacifier with addition of options below:\n\n   a. Lumbar puncture: LMX-4 at site, subQ lidocaine\n\n   b. Chest tube: subQ lidocaine, opioid analgesic, or short acting anesthetic\n\n   c. Circumcision: LMX-4 locally, dorsal penile nerve block or ring block with lidocaine, Mogen over Gomco, acetaminophen post-procedure\n\n   d. Eye examination: local anesthetic eye drops\n\n   e. Post-operative pain: do not use sucrose. At least 48 hrs of around-the-clock analgesic such as opiate ± acetaminophen depending on bowel function/NPO status.

Davis, MD, MS Epi and Valerie Y. Chock, MD, MS Epi\n\n## I. Amplitude Integrated EEG (aEEG)\n\n### A. What is aEEG?\n\naEEG is a simplified, bedside EEG device used to continuously monitor brain function. Brain wave activity is recorded from scalp electrodes and the raw EEG data is processed using a filter to attenuate frequencies <2Hz and >15Hz, amplitudes are transformed into a rectified and time-compressed signal and displayed on a semi-logarithmic scale in microVolts (µV). Interpretation of the aEEG recording includes assessment of the minimum amplitude, maximum amplitude, bandwidth, and the presence of sleep-wake cycles (SWC). This results in patterns that are easily recognizable without formal training in EEG analysis.\n\n### B. Indications for aEEG monitoring\n\n1. Confirmation of suspected clinical seizures, especially when formal continuous EEG is not available\n2. Assessment for subclinical seizures in high risk infants (e.g. preterm with severe IVH)\n3. Continuous monitoring of therapeutic effects of anti-epileptic medication\n4. Prediction of outcomes in hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE)\n5. Other potential, but not well-studied, uses for aEEG include: metabolic encephalopathy, patients on ECMO, assessment of neuromaturation in preterm infants, assessment of post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus, surgical anesthesia and post-operative recovery\n\n<a id='390c2155-08a4-442d-9dfa-d122e0c33b1a'></a>\n\nC. Placement of aEEG\n\n1.  Types of electrodes\n    a.  Hydrogel: most commercial aEEG devices utilize these disposable electrodes which are similar to regular EKG electrodes\n    b.  Cup-disk or spider: reusable; requires EEG conductive paste (Ten20 paste)\n    c.  Needle: minimal skin preparation required and achieves low impedances; invasive, with theoretical risk for infection\n\n2.  Recording montages: Location of electrodes based on the 10-20 international classification system modified for neonates (Figure 1)\n    a.  Single channel: traditionally, electrodes are positioned at P3 and P4, which is the area overlying the cortical watershed zone in infants with HIE.\n    b.  Three channel: electrodes positioned at C3, P3, C4, P4 create two bi-parietal channels (C3-P3, C4-P4) and a cross-cerebral channel (P3-P4). This is most commonly used at LPCH.\n    c.  All devices require an additional ground electrode, usually placed on the upper back (preferred) or forehead. Some devices may additionally require a reference electrode on the scalp (typically Cz)\n    d.  Other EEG recording systems may utilize additional channels\n\n<a id='00061020-5e88-4307-ba3e-63b2f593d728'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Three channel aEEG utilizes electrodes at C3, C4, P3, and P4 to create a right-sided channel (C4-P4), a left-sided channel (C3-P3) and a cross-cerebral channel (P3-P4).\n\n<a id='ae0022bc-1a24-4205-ad27-93a838457a8c'></a>\n\n<::The image is a diagram illustrating the 10-20 system for EEG electrode placement on a human head, viewed from above. \n\n**Anatomical Landmarks:**\n- Nasion (at the top, front of the head)\n- Inion (at the bottom, back of the head)\n- Preauricular Point (on both left and right sides, near the ears)\n\n**Electrode Positions:**\n- Fp1, Fp2\n- F7, F3, Fz, F4, F8\n- T3, C3, Cz, C4, T4\n- T5, P3, Pz, P4, T6\n- O1, O2\n\n**Lines and Regions:**\n- A solid vertical line runs from Nasion through Fz, Cz, Pz, to Inion.\n- A solid horizontal line runs between the Preauricular Points, passing through T3, C3, Cz, C4, T4.\n- Dashed lines connect other electrode points, forming a grid.\n- Numbered regions are indicated: 1 (central), 2 (left central), 3 (left frontal-polar), 4a (left frontal-central), 4b (right frontal-central), 5 (right frontal-polar), 6 (parietal-occipital).\n: diagram::>\n\n<a id='ca0ffb26-b021-4ff5-90e7-0d8290cd9ab6'></a>\n\n3. Skin preparation: when cup-disk or hydrogel electrodes are used, skin should be cleaned and exfoliated prior to application.

Data quality: Impedance is continuously measured during the aEEG recording. Impedances greater than 10kΩ indicate poor electrode contact, insufficient skin preparation, or electrical interference, and the electrodes should be checked. Ideally, impedances are below 5 KΩ prior to starting the recording\n\n<a id='b31d2ba9-51df-4fbe-a997-fac0f07863c7'></a>\n\n5. Available aEEG equipment:\n\na.

Low Voltage: continuous background with both minimum and maximum amplitudes less than 10μ V\n\ne. Isoelectric/flat: primarily isoelectric tracing with amplitudes less than 5µ V\n\nf. Recovery of a normal background pattern (either continuous or discontinuous) within 36-48 hours has been associated with a good outcome in term HIE.\n\ng. Recovery of background pattern and SWCs may be delayed for infants treated with hypothermia.\n\nh. Preterm infants: In healthy preterm infants, the aEEG matures from a discontinuous pattern to a continuous pattern with advancing gestational and postmenstrual age. In other words, the minimum amplitude increases, the bandwidth and maximum amplitude decrease, and there is interval development of mature sleep-wake cycles. Isoelectric and low voltage patterns have been associated with the development of intraventricular hemorrhage.\n\n<a id='807dedcc-a992-4595-880f-f4dcf079c16c'></a>\n\n2. Seizures\n   a.

Shorter time to recovery of SWCs is associated with improved outcome in term HIE, while lack of SWC recovery predicts poor outcome.\n\nE. Limitations of aEEG monitoring\n\n1. Due to nature of the time-compressed recording, brief seizures (<30 seconds) may be missed\n2. As only one to three channels are recorded, seizures or abnormal background activity in the frontal or occipital regions will not be detected\n3. Artifacts\n   a. Mimics of seizures include any repetitive movement such as burping, patting, swinging\n   b. High frequency ventilation, external electrical interference, EKG, and muscle movement can falsely elevate amplitudes\n   c. Contact between electrodes (either by physical contact or by a bridge created by paste/moisture) can result in falsely low amplitudes\n   d. Sedative medications may depress the background pattern and/or suppress SWCs\n\n<a id='137a6e0a-3265-4c03-892b-a51edd56b668'></a>\n\nII. **Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS)**\n\nA. **What is NIRS?**\n\nNIRS is a non-invasive technique to continuously monitor regional tissue oxygenation. It has most commonly been used for cerebral oximetry, although monitoring of renal and mesenteric oxygenation are other potential applications. A skin sensor transmits near-infrared light, which penetrates underlying tissues to a depth of 2.5 to 3 cm. Light is differentially absorbed by oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin from the tissue vasculature, and remaining light is then detected by the sensor. A regional tissue oxygen saturation (rSO2) is then calculated based on a weighted average of 20% arterial blood, 75% venous blood, and 5% capillary blood in the underlying tissue. The rSO2 value reflects a regional balance between tissue oxygen supply and demand.\n\nB. **Indications for 2-site NIRS monitoring (and admission to NeuroNICU)**\n\n1. Conditions with altered hemodynamic states causing cerebral hypoxemia\n   a. Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy\n   b. Congenital heart disease- especially with decreased systemic outflow for peri-operative monitoring\n   c. Prematurity with altered cerebral autoregulation. All preterm infants <29 weeks gestation undergo NIRS monitoring for the first week of life.\n   d. Hypoxic respiratory failure or pre-ECMO\n\n2. Conditions with altered hemodynamics affecting mesenteric or renal oxygenation\n   a. Shock- Drop in somatic oxygenation may be an early potential indicator of low cardiac output before other indicators like blood pressure, acidosis, and decreased urine output\n\n<a id='358d9ba8-6710-4465-bb9c-8781f69ec354'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Over the last several decades, survival rates have improved across many diagnostic groups admitted to the NICU, however the rates of neurologic and neurodevelopmental impairment are increasing with life-long effects on survivors and their families. The Neuro NICU was developed to improve the care of newborns with brain injury or at risk for brain injury. Another stimulus was the expertise developed over the last decade at LPCH in the areas of therapeutic hypothermia, aEEG, NIRS, neuroradiology, prenatal diagnosis, and high-risk infant follow-up.\n\n<a id='a6b6a3fb-00f0-48ad-a695-dd3c54aa572d'></a>\n\nA. The Johnson Center and LPCH generously provided funding for the development of a virtual unit within the NICU focused on improving the care for this patient population. After a year of planning, program development, and staff training, the Neuro NICU opened in April 2013.\n\n1. Nursing Staffing:\n   a. We are currently staffed with over 90 Neuro NICU trained RNs, and our goal is to ultimately train all NICU nurses to care for infants undergoing non-invasive brain monitoring.\n   b. Currently we can provide care for at least 2 Neuro NICU patients per shift. This number will increase as more nursing staff successfully complete required Neuro NICU training and skills labs.\n\n<a id='8dded610-5e82-4ed3-8264-03093b873cb0'></a>\n\n2.

HIE (40-60% have seizures)\n2. ECMO (10-20% have seizures)\n3. S/P certain cardiac surgeries (5-20%)\n4. Stroke/hemorrhage/SVT (~80% of neonatal stroke presents as seizure)\n5. CNS Infections\n6. Genetic/metabolic conditions\n\nB. All neonates with clinically suspected seizures should receive immediate aEEG and urgent Video EEG (VEEG) monitoring for confirmation of diagnosis and ongoing management. Separate aEEG should be discontinued when VEEG is initiated-- aEEG trends can be displayed at bedside using most of the VEEG machines, and technical problems arise if both sets of electrodes are used simultaneously.\n1. 80-90% of neonatal seizures are **subclinical**, with no outward signs, and can only be diagnosed by VEEG/aEEG.\n2. Up to 50% of abnormal movements suspected to be seizures in NICU babies are **not** seizures on EEG, but rather are seizure mimics.\n3. aEEG is initiated by the NICU team.\na. aEEG is interpreted at the bedside on an ongoing basis by NICU staff\nb. When interpreted by experienced users, aEEG identifies about 2/3 of patients with seizures, but is less accurate for identifying (quantifying) individual seizures.\nc. aEEG is a great option for immediate monitoring to see if a baby is having any seizures, until the EEG tech arrives to start vEEG for precise diagnosis.\n4. To request video EEG monitoring (including urgent vEEG at night and on weekends if available), the NICU fellow/attending should page the neurology resident on call. Ordering VEEG in Epic will **not** initiate vEEG without this conversation.\na. If clinically suspected seizure occurs while on video EEG, press the event button to mark the event on the EEG file, and write a description on the bedside log.\nb. If seizures are suspected based on aEEG changes, enter in comment at bedside (if aEEG machine), or push event button to mark area of concern (if vEEG machine)\nc. The neurology team should be contacted to review events as needed to confirm whether or not they are seizures. Otherwise, VEEG is reviewed at least twice daily by the EEG attending, and daily reports are posted in EPIC.",

Arterial Ischemic\n    b. Intracranial hemorrhage:\n        i. Subarachnoid: usually otherwise asymptomatic (\"well baby with seziures\")\n        ii. Intraventricular: associated with prematurity\n        iii. Subdural: associated with traumatic delivery\n    c. Sinovenous thrombosis – may be evident from Doppler flow on HUS or MRV\n3.  **Hypoglycemia**: occurs in association with SGA, IDM, and/or asphyxia.\n4.  **Hypocalcemia**: occurs in association with prematurity, IDM, asphyxia, hypoparathyroidism, DiGeorge/VCF syndrome (22q11.2 deletion), cardiac anomalies.\n5.  **Other electrolyte abnormalities**: hypomagnesemia, hypo/hypernatremia.\n6.  **CNS infection**: meningitis, encephalitis, brain abscess, congenital TORCH, Zika\n7.  **Developmental defects**: cortical dysgenesis",

If hypoglycemic (<40 mg/dl), give 2-3 ml/kg D10W IVP then start or increase IV glucose infusion to give at least 7-8 mg/kg/min.\n2. If hypocalcemic, give 10-20 mg/kg Calcium chloride IV push.\n3. If hypomagnesemic give 25-50 mg/kg Magnesium sulfate IV.\n\n**C. First line diagnostic tests** include:\n1. CBC\n2. Urine Toxic Screen\n3. Complete Metabolic Panel\n4. Lactate\n5. Blood culture\n6. Head ultrasound- Head Ultrasound is useful for excluding hemorrhage and for initial images while awaiting MRI, and for serial imaging. EEG electrodes are not a contraindication to HUS- it can be performed by moving one electrode, and does not require discontinuing VEEG.\n\n**D. Head imaging** – Indicated as soon as possible (when baby stable and MRI available) for neonates with seizures. It will provide a diagnosis in ~90% of cases of neonatal seizures. MRI is preferred for resolution and multidimensional imaging and possibility of MRA and MRV. Head CT should be used very rarely, when immediate imaging is needed and neither HUS nor MRI is possible.\n\n**E. Revisit family history** after parents have checked with family; often new information comes out after a baby has seizures.\n\n**F. Additional tests to consider** (depending on clinical situation)\n1. Lumbar puncture - to rule out infection (bacterial & viral studies), hemorrhage. Send glucose with a paired serum glucose sample. If possible, consider sending additional CSF test (below) from LP, or saving CSF for additional studies\n2. TORCH titers & Zika\n3. ABG\n4. Ammonia, lactate with paired pyruvate\n5. Serum amino acids, urine organic acids, acylcarnitine profile, free/total carnitine.\n\n**G. Testing for Genetic/Metabolic causes** Genetic testing identifies the cause of neonatal seizures in >50% of neonates at LPCH who have seizures but normal MRI, and may influence treatment choice. Discuss with neurology to select those tests relevant to the individual patient.\n1. Serum biotinidase, uric acid, acylcarnitine panel, carnitine (free and total), very long chain fatty acids, pipecolic acid. alpha-AASA, guanidinoacetate/creatine\n2.

If multiple boluses have been given, follow drug levels and begin maintenance when levels begin to fall (this may take several days).\n1. Phenobarbital: Maintenance dose 4-5 mg/kg/day given QD or BID.\n2. Fosphenytoin: Maintenance dose 5 mg/kg/day divided TID. (Therapeutic levels are extremely difficult to maintain with PO dosing—rarely continued beyond a few days.)\n3. Levetiracetam: Maintenance dose 40-80 mg/kg/day divided TID. Levels are not usually measured.\nB. Duration of maintenance therapy will depend on individual circumstances. In general, children with acute symptomatic seizures (e.g. in perinatal arterial stroke) are often able to stop seizure medicines prior to NICU discharge, while those with genetic or metabolic conditions may require lifelong treatment.\nC. All patients discharged on anti-seizure medicines should have a follow-up visit with a pediatric neurologist 4-6",

The incidence of IVH in premature infants has declined in the past 20 yrs from 40% of all premature births to around 25%, in part due to antenatal steroid administration. The incidence increases with decreasing gestational age. IVH becomes much more common at <28 wks gestation and is rare after 34 wks gestation. If an IVH is to occur, the early stages are detected in 90% of infants before 4 days of age and 99% by 10 days of age. Extension of IVH occurs typically by 2-4 wks of age.",

This is a periventricular structure located between the caudate nucleus and the thalamus. It contains a fine vascular network devoid of supportive stroma. The GM undergoes a progressive decrease in size as gestational age increases, with nearly complete involution by approximately 36 wks. As preterm infants are at high risk for impaired cerebrovascular autoregulation, a host of factors (e.g., anemia, volume resuscitation, pneumothorax, CPR, hypercarbia, and acidosis), whose common endpoint is abnormally increased cerebral blood flow, leads to rupture of the delicate blood vessels of the GM. Also implicated as potential etiologies are infection/inflammation that can affect vessel fragility, changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) that may occur with PDA, and a decrease in CBF that may be associated with hyperventilation and hypocarbia.",

More recently at LPCH, radiologists have chosen to describe the constellation of findings seen on cranial ultrasound including location and size of any bleeding, dilatation (or narrowing) of ventricles, and any evidence of edema or any structural abnormalities that are appreciated. Intraparenchymal echodensity may also be used to describe a periventricular hemorrhagic infarction (PVHI), which rather than a traditional Grade IV extension of bleeding into the parenchyma, instead reflects obstruction of venous flow and venous infarction. It is important to review findings with a radiologist to distinguish these differences for better prognostication. In addition, there may be documentation of the resistive index (RI) of the middle cerebral artery:\n\nRI = (Peak systolic velocity - End diastolic velocity)/ (Peak systolic velocity)",

Post hemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH) occurs in up to 1/3-1/2 of patients with grade III or IV IVH, but occurs rarely in less severe IVH. The hallmarks are progressive ventricular dilatation and abnormal increase in OFC. Treatment can include close monitoring, serial LPs, ventriculostomy, and mechanical shunting depending upon response to non-surgical management and/or the presence of signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure. Signs of increased ICP in the neonate include: OFC increase >1-1.5 cm/wk, tense anterior fontanelle, cranial suture separation or neurologic signs such as decreased alertness, apnea, seizures or sun-setting (downward gaze of eyes). aEEG monitoring may demonstrate increased discontinuity and loss of sleep-wake cycling with progressive hydrocephalus.\n\nB. Periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) is a generally symmetric, non-hemorrhagic, and ischemic white matter injury of the premature brain. As premature infants have relatively pressure-passive blood-brain barrier integrity, changes in systemic BP may be more likely to lead to changes in CBF with resultant PVL. It leads to necrosis in the periventricular white matter and secondary enlargement of the lateral ventricles. This disorder is often associated with IVH and with factors that predispose to IVH. Cytokine-mediated inflammation may also play a distinct role in the development of PVL. PVL is commonly associated with neurologic handicap (primarily the spastic diplegia form of cerebral palsy). It can be diagnosed most reliably by MRI but can also be detected in most cases by ultrasound as periventricular echodensities or cystic lesions.\n\nC. Neuromotor sequelae: Major IVH is associated strongly with neuromotor handicaps ranging from minor to severe. Definite neurologic sequelae are seen in 25-50% of cases with severe grade III & IV, but in only 5- 15% of grade I to II hemorrhage (which is about the same rate as preterm infants without identified IVH). However, recent literature suggests that even grade I to II IVH may lead to increased risks for neurodevelopmental impairment. Infants with bilateral IVH or those who require a shunt are at significantly higher risk for neurologic sequelae.",

A screening head ultrasound is indicated for infants with a birth weight <1500 grams and/or gestational age < 32 weeks at 7-10 days of age. Earlier scanning may be indicated by clinical suspicion and/or when withdrawal of intensive care support is being considered.

Recent developments in MR imaging (e.g., diffusion-weighted imaging and diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI and DWI)) allow for better quantification of brain size and myelinization. MRI is likely the most sensitive and accurate modality for imaging PVL. We try to obtain DTI/DWI in all premature infants once they are >35-36 wks corrected gestational age. This is usually best done when they are stable in an open crib and requiring no more than supplemental oxygen for respiratory support. Besides premature infants (BW <1500 gm or GA<32 weeks), other babies at high risk for CNS injury (e.g. infants with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, metabolic disorder, or post-ECMO support) may also be candidates for an MRI study.\n\nB. Infants needing an MRI usually are done as a \"feed and bundle\" (feed the infant just prior to and swaddle them during the scan). If this is unsuccessful, then the infant must be rescheduled. With second attempt, infant should be made NPO and sedation given. This must be done per the moderate sedation protocol. The infant must never be given sedation without being NPO for an MRI. The Pediatric Anesthesia Service may be consulted for those patients needing sedation.",

Definition\n\nRetinopathy of prematurity (ROP) refers to the abnormal growth of blood vessels in the retina of premature infants. The incidence of ROP increases with decreasing gestational age and lower birth weight. In its most severe state, ROP leads to scarring and retinal detachment, and subsequently visual impairment and blindness.",

Several other risk factors have been identified, such as: low birth weight; oxygen use; assisted ventilation for over one week; severity of illness; high blood transfusion volume; and hyperglycemia. 1-5 Elevated arterial oxygen tension with paO2 > 80 mm Hg is thought to contribute to development of ROP, but the SUPPORT trial demonstrated increased risk of mortality in infants exposed to lower O2 saturation goals in attempts to reduce ROP.",

Prompt detection and treatment is the best way to preserve vision.\n\nA. PaO2 ≥80 mm Hg in the first 2 wks of life has been shown to increase the risk of development of severe ROP, however decreased target oxygenation saturation has been associated with increased mortality.\n\nB. In the STOP-ROP trial infants were maintained with O2 sats either 89-94% (conventional) or 96-99% (supplemental). Although there was a trend towards a decrease in conversion from prethreshold to threshold ROP in the supplemental group, the results were not statistically significant. However, in the group with no Plus disease, there was a statistically significant benefit in infants in the supplemental group (46% vs 32%). However, supplemental oxygen increased the risk of adverse pulmonary events.\n\nC. In the SUPPORT and BOOST II trials infants were maintained with O2 sats 85-89% (low sat arm) or 91-95% (high sat arm). ROP was reduced in the low sat arm (85-89%) however, the risk of death was higher. The BOOST II trial also found a higher rate of NEC in the low sat arm.\n\nD. In the LPCH NICU, infants who reach prethreshold stage 2 or 3 ROP are managed with a combination of increased oxygen saturation levels (97-100%), correction of anemia (Hct ≥40%) and exposure to room light (i.e. removing the cover on the isolette to reduce rod photoreceptor oxygen consumption). These interventions aim to down-regulate pathologically elevated levels of VEGF.",

Avastin (Bevacizumab)\n\nIntravitereal injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy such as Avastin have become a new treatment modality for ROP10 as it is a shorter procedure with need for only topical anesthesia versus intubation and sedation needed for laser therapy. A multicenter randomized controlled trial BEAT-ROP11 also demonstrated a reduced recurrence of ROP at 54 weeks when compared to laser treatment for zone I ROP and decreased rates of severe high myopia at 2.5 years. Laser therapy may still be required if patients do not respond to the injection, or if ROP worsens after the injection.\n\nRecently, concerns have been raised about systemic absorption of Avastin and potential harmful effects on developing tissues, specifically the brain. A recent study by the Canadian Neonatal Network12 showed that premature infants treated with Avastin had higher odds of severe neurodevelopmental disabilities at 18 months, and a statistically significantly lower Bayley motor composite score. Caution should be used when deciding between treatment with Avastin versus laser therapy.",

Hydrocephalus is an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the ventricles of the brain or subarachnoid spaces. It can be congenital (about 1 out of 1000 live births). Common causes of congenital hydrocephalus include aqueductal stenosis, spina bifida, arachnoid cysts, Dandy-Walker syndrome and Chiari malformation. Common causes of acquired hydrocephalus include intraventricular hemorrhage, brain tumors, infection or head trauma.\n\n1.  Non-communicating hydrocephalus or obstructive hydrocephalus: blockage within the CSF pathway or within the subarachnoid spaces.\n    a. Most common is aqueductal stenosis. The aqueduct of Sylvius is the narrow pathway between the 3rd and 4th ventricle. A child may be born with abnormally narrowed aqueduct or aqueductal webbing. It can also be blocked from infection, hemorrhage or from a tumor. This results in enlargement of the lateral and 3rd ventricles.\n2.  Communicating hydrocephalus: impaired reabsorption of CSF within the arachnoid villi, basal cisterns, and subarachnoid spaces. A rare cause of CSF overproduction can occur with choroid plexus papilloma.",

OVERVIEW\n\nTherapeutic hypothermia is now the standard of care for newborns with moderate to severe HIE identified at less than 6 hours of age. A meta-analysis of 1214 infants enrolled in 7 trials concluded that reduction in body temperature to 33-34° C in infants ≥36 weeks gestation with moderate to severe HIE results in significant reductions in the risk of death or major neurodevelopmental disability at 18 months of age (RR 0.76 95% CI 0.69-0.84) and an increase in the rate of survival with normal neurologic function.1 The number need to treat (NNT) is 7. The reduction in death or major neurodevelopmental disability was greatest in those with moderate HIE (RR 0.67 95% CI 0.56-0.81) when compared with those with severe HIE (RR 0.83 95% CI 0.74-0.92). The reduction in adverse outcomes was very similar for total body hypothermia and selective head cooling. Side effects of cooling are limited to bradycardia and thrombocytopenia, however neither is clinically significant. There is a higher rate of PPHN in cooled infants however the difference is not statistically significant but may be clinically important.2,3",

Infants were randomized to cooling for **96 hours** to a temperature of 33-34°C or to control. Bayesian analysis indicates that there is benefit; however, this benefit was less than that if treated by 6 hours after birth. Late Hypothermia provides a 76% chance of a lower rate of death or disability, but the extent of the benefit is uncertain. Given there are no other treatments available and the risks associated with this therapy are minimal, we recommend performing therapeutic hypothermia on qualifying infants.",

A Randomized Trial of Targeted Temperature Management with Whole Body Hypothermia for Moderate and Severe Neonatal Encephalopathy in Premature Infants 33-25 Weeks Gestational Age-A Bayesian Study (Preemie Cooling)\n\nPreemie Cooling will determine if whole body cooling will improve survival and reduce disability in babies with HIE born at 330/7 to 356/7 weeks, presenting within 6 hours of birth. Patients will be randomized to an intervention arm with a temperature of 33.5°C for 72 hours or to a control arm with temperatures 36.5°-37.3°C with active intervention for temperatures >37.3°C.\n\nB. High Dose Erythropoietin for Asphyxia and Encephalopathy (HEAL)\n\nHEAL is a trial of high-dose erythropoietin vs. placebo in term babies with HIE who are being cooled clinically (33.5C for 72h) to determine if the rates of death or moderate/severe motor or cognitive deficits can be reduced.",

Utilize Holding Algorithm to determine if infant is eligible for holding during maintenance phase of cooling.\n\nB. After 72 hours of cooling is complete, infant should be gradually rewarmed over at least 7 hours. Avoid\ntemperatures > 37.0°C.\n\nC. Continuous vEEG should occur during induction phase, maintenance phase, and throughout rewarming\nphase. Ideally, vEEG should continue until 24 hours after rewarmed; however, once the patient has been\nrewarmed vEEG may be discontinued at the discretion of Neurology. Consider asking EEG tech to leave\nCerebral and Parietal electrodes in place when removing vEEG in order to continue neuromonitoring via\naEEG on OBM/Moberg/BRM equipment.\n\nD. All patients undergoing therapeutic hypothermia need to have a brain MRI. Include \"therapeutic hypothermia\nprotocol\" and/or \"HEAL Protocol\" when entering MRI order in EPIC. Optimal timing of MRI depends on goals\nof MRI. If one is seeking the highest sensitivity for timing of injury (i.e. whether it was perinatal), early\nscanning at 24-96 hours makes sense. Later scanning at 7-21 days allows for the highest sensitivity for\nextent of injury (i.e. for prognosis); yet the later the scan the worse the sensitivity is for ascertaining timing of\ninjury. Current practice at LPCH is to perform a single scan at day of life 5 to 7. An MRI at this time gives\nthe best trade off between sensitivity for timing of injury and sensitivity for determining extent of injury for\nprognosis.6",

As recently as the late 1970s, it was commonplace to perform surgery on neonates without benefit of anesthesia or analgesia. Although this might sound surprising, there was little known at the time about the pain experiences of neonates, infants, and other non-verbal children. Clinicians thought non-verbal children were incapable of feeling pain, and that they were not able to remember it. Concerns were also frequently raised about the possible adverse effects of pain medications, since they had not yet been evaluated in this population.\n\nB. We now have good evidence for the presence of a predictable stress response to painful interventions in neonates, and can offer treatments to prevent and mitigate this with better knowledge for their potential risks and benefits. The work of Anand et al. (1985) was instrumental in demonstrating that neonates mount a stress response to surgery consisting of detrimental hormonal, metabolic, and cardiovascular effects, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Further studies have shown that this stress response can be reduced by administration of analgesics.\n\nC. In the developing nervous system, nociceptive pathways are present by 24-26 wks, but inhibitory pathways do not develop until the 3rd trimester. Therefore, it is possible that preemie infants feel MORE pain for a given stimulus than older infants, children, and adults. We are now also aware that infants exposed to painful stimuli exhibit exaggerated pain responses to future painful stimuli, making our attention to pain management in the NICU even more important.",

Pain is defined as an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience, associated with actual or potential tissue damage or defined in terms of such damage.\n\nB. Pain is a subjective phenomenon. It is REAL regardless of whether tissue damage can be identified or not.\n\nC. Most importantly for infants, the inability to communicate verbally does not negate the possibility than an individual is experiencing pain and is in need of appropriate pain-relieving treatment.",

Common causes of non-painful distress are hunger, feeling too cold or hot, needing a diaper changed, being over stimulated by lights and/or sounds, or wanting to be held/wrapped/rocked.\n\nB. Behavior alone is an unreliable predictor of the cause of pain or distress. For example, a baby may be still and outwardly calm, but with tachycardia and limited movement of one lower extremity as the only signs of pain from a broken leg. On the other hand, some neonates scream, arch, and grimace just to let us know their diaper is wet! When assessing a distressed infant consider if pain or other causes of distress could be occurring, and use this to guide your history-taking, physical exam, and studies you obtain.",

Schedule for assessments: with every vital sign, 30 min after a pain management intervention (non-pharmacologic or pharmacologic), and other times pain is suspected to be likely to occur (such as during procedures known to be painful or if the patient is fussy.)\n\nB. There are many tools available to systematically characterize the physiologic changes and/or behavioral markers found to be present for infants. In the LPCH NICU/ICN we use the N-PASS (Neonatal Pain, Agitation & Sedation Scale) because of its ease of use, and because validation and reliability data are available.\n\nC. N-PASS scores are located in the chart under IView Critical Care Detailed, so that you can have access to this information when rounding and planning care for a baby.\n\n   1. The N-PASS pain is scored 0 (no pain) up to 10 (severe/highest pain). Note: negative points are assigned when an infant is being sedated.\n\n   2. Nurses will record pain regularly as described in A above, but if you want to score a baby yourself, here's how: Find the value corresponding to the box in each row that best describes a baby's current state, and add the total of all the rows.\n\n   3. Detailed information about the N-PASS tool can be found at http://www.ilemsc.org/PainMgt/NPASS.pdf.\n\nD. Remember that the pain score is only one element of pain assessment. It is just as important to rule out other causes of distress; characterize the timing, frequency, duration, location, provocative/palliative factors, and effect of any prior interventions on the pain. This information directs further evaluation and treatment.\n\nVI. **Pain Management**\n\nManagement options for pain include prevention as well as treatment of the underlying process causing the pain and distress. When it is not possible to immediately cure or prevent an underlying cause of pain, or when we must have an infant undergo a diagnostic or therapeutic intervention that we know will be painful, we utilize multimodal pain therapy as a strategy to prevent or limit the pain experienced. There is evidence that measurable improvements in pain management occur after implementation of practice guidelines directed at improving pain in NICU populations.\n\nVII. **General Guidelines**\n\nMultimodal therapy means using more than one strategy to prevent, treat, or manage pain. Using multiple non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic methods together improve analgesia over a single intervention alone, and may help to limit unwanted side effects by reducing the total dose needed of an individual medication. This is effective whether the pain is mild, moderate or severe.\n\nA. Non-pharmacologic pain management interventions are helpful alone, in conjunction with each other, and when used with medications. Although the effects of these measures are sometimes minimized by health care practitioners who are not at the bedside, dramatic improvements in infant distress are possible from implementing them. Consider the following:\n\n   1. Prevention (do you REALLY need the information you will obtain from a particular test, or might there be a less painful/invasive way to discover that information or answer your clinical question? Can labs be batched, and obtained by indwelling line or venipuncture rather than multiple heel sticks, which are more painful?)",

Controling thermal stress by providing for comfortable stable ambient temperature\n11. Using skilled/trained personnel to obtain blood and place IV lines\n12. Use mechanical rather than manual lancets for heel sticks\n13. Comfort measures including: swaddling, containment, facilitated tucking, positioning, nesting, rocking, kangaroo care (skin-to-skin), non-nutritive sucking, breastfeeding, massage, music therapy, and age-appropriate special mattresses are very helpful\n14. Consulting pain service to provide acupuncture/acupressure and massage\n\nPharmacologic interventions for pain management include opiates, non-opiate analgesics (acetaminophen, less likely NSAIDS, sucrose), local anesthetics, and systemic anesthetics with analgesic properties. Non-analgesic adjuvants (anxiolytics and sedatives) are often combined with analgesics and non-pharmacologic strategies to lessen stress and improve a patient's overall experience with a painful event. It is important to realize that no ideal pain medication exists that is universally beneficial and without side effects. Therefore, what follows are general suggestions about when to use them, contraindications to use, side effects to watch for, and guidelines for how to choose a dose.

They exhibit no ceiling analgesic effect, so may be increased as tolerance develops, to continue to provide analgesia.\n\n   b. Opiates may be administered by single dose or drip depending on length of time analgesia is needed. Consider 1 or 2 single doses (or more) for a procedure, drips or around-the-clock dosing for at least 48 hrs for post-operative pain and for expected, regular and frequent painful interventions such as those that accompany intubation (e.g., need to reposition, suctioning).\n\n   c. The best routes to use in NICU population include PO, NG/OG, and IV. SC and rectal are not as useful due to variable absorption, transdermal patch doses are too strong for this age group except in specific circumstances (when significant opiate tolerance +/- chronic pain are present), and the intramuscular route is never recommended given that this route is painful and absorption is erratic.\n\n   d.

Prolonged use leads to physical dependence (similar to that occurring with prolonged steroid use), so, to prevent withdrawal, you must always taper the drug slowly (no more than 10-20% per day) when a patient has regularly used an opiate for 5-7 days or longer.\n\nf. Morphine and fentanyl have been the most used and studied in the NICU population. Therefore, reserve use of hydromorphone, methadone or other opiates, for which pharmacodynamic and safety data are limited, to experienced practitioners such as intensivists, anesthesiologist, or following consultation with the pain team.\n\ni. Morphine\n\na) Morphine is a potent analgesic. Chest wall rigidity is less of a risk, and less tolerance develops than with fentanyl. However, morphine is more sedating than fentanyl and recent multi-center trials reveal 2 reasons to use fentanyl over morphine in 23-26 weekers who are already unstable from a CV standpoint: Morphine may worsen hypotension in this group, and morphine's analgesic efficacy, even with good blood levels, may be questionable.\n\nb) Dosing guidelines to initiate therapy in opiate naive patients (usually safest to start low and go up): 0.025-0.1 mg/kg IV bolus, or orally at 3 times the dose (0.075-0.3 mg/kg) every 6 hrs for infants under 3 mos post delivery, q 4 or more often in infants greater than 3 mos post delivery regardless of gestational age. Titrate to effect but watch for side effects. Drips can begin at 0.01-0.03 mg/kg/h depending on level of respiratory depression and sedation (side effects of the drug) you are also intending to achieve with it. Use with extreme caution in patients with renal failure, as sedating and anti-analagesic metabolites may have slow clearance.\n\nc) Future effects, a common parental and staff concern: Former preterm infants who had received morphine in NICU for pain management and were reevaluated at 8-9 years old showed improved executive functioning, and no adverse effects on somatosensory perception, pain thresholds, incidence of chronic pain or neurological functioning relative to infants that received placebo (de Graaf et al., 2013).

Fentanyl\n\na) Fentanyl is a potent analgesic, that has quicker onset (1-2 min), is shorter acting (1-2 hrs), and has less GI slowing, less hemodynamic instability and less urinary retention than morphine. However, there is a greater risk of chest wall rigidity, especially with rapid infusion (give bolus doses slowly!), and much more frequent acute tolerance to the drug than Morphine.\n\nb) It is lipophilic, so it distributes widely and quickly into fatty tissue and extravascular fluid. This can lead to reduced efficacy with single doses, and it can be difficult to clear the drug from extravascular fluid if given by prolonged infusions.",

No tolerance to the drug develops and there is an added analgesic effect when used with opiates.\n\ni.

Dose: Pharmacokinetics not established in preemies <28 wks. Usual dose modified in 2011 by recommendation of FDA over hepatotoxicity concerns in adults, now limit dose to 10-15 mg/kg PO/IV, or 20-30 mg/kg PR every 6 hrs. Maximum daily cumulative doses PO/IV of 40 mg/kg/d for 28-32 wks, and 60 mg/kg/d for infants 32-36 wks GA and FT infants <10 days are suggested although risk/benefit for long term use in neonates has not been established.

NSAIDS are good mild/moderate analgesics especially in preventing inflammatory pain.\n\nUnfortunately, few studies have assessed risks/benefits in infants less than 6 mos of age, thus there is limited utility of this class of medications for analgesia, although multiple trials have described efficacy for PDA closure.\n\nii. Risks include displacement of bilirubin, renal toxicity and/or alteration of clearance of other drugs through kidneys, gastritis/GI bleeding, platelet dysfunction, premature closure of duct if infant has duct dependent cardiac anatomy. Suggest use only on limited basis as directed by experienced practitioners assessing risks and benefits of use for a particular NICU patient.\n\nc.

No known side effects, but postulated could cause hyperglycemia or necrotizing enterocolitis. One study suggested that repeated frequent dosing may have contributed to poor neurobehavioral outcomes later in life in <31 week infants.

Local Anesthetics\n\nLocal anesthetics such as lidocaine and bupivacaine/levo-bupivacaine provide local or regional anesthesia by preventing nerve transmission.\n\ni. Used in our NICU in various forms: topically in cream (LMX-4), for subcutaneous injection or into peripheral nerve locations, via epidural route, IV, IO, or via ETT. Topical may be used for circumcision, venipuncture, arterial puncture, lumbar puncture, PICC line placement, but not effective for heel lance. Injectable form is helpful for diagnostic and surgical procedures including chest tube insertion (local or intercostal block), suturing, circumcision (DPNB or ring block), and IV catheter placement. **Do not use the form that contains epinephrine** on areas with end vascular supply such as digits, penis or pinnae as resulting vasoconstriction could lead to necrosis. Use of local anesthetics delivered via regional block or infusion (e.g. via epidural) is limited to experienced practitioners including Anesthesia, Pain Service, Surgery, and intensivists with knowledge of risks/side effects. In capable hands these are usually well tolerated and very effective in reducing localized pain and thus may dramatically reduce requirements for systemic opiate.\n\nii. Dose: LMX-41/4 inch thick to local area intact skin only, SQ/IM lidocaine injection varies, suggested maximum dose in Housestaff Manual 4.5 mg/kg/2 hrs, epidural bupivacaine/levo-bupivacaine infusion of 0.1% not to exceed 3 ml/kg/h.\n\ne. Ketamine\n\nKetamine is a dissociative anesthetic, with sedative, analgesic, and amnestic properties.\n\ni. Risk of deep sedation/anesthesia, hypoxemia, laryngospasm or apnea. Use at Packard is limited to Anesthesiologists and Intensivists and others under approved sedation protocols only. Studies have shown ketamine to be effective for bronchoscopy in infants; however, it has not been demonstrated to be effective for endotracheal suctioning.\n\nf. Alpha-2 Agonist therapy\n\nClonidine and Dexmedetomidine are central alpha-2 agonist with analgesic properties.\n\ni. Limited data exist regarding pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy in infants. This currently limits more widespread use. Both drugs carry risk for hypotension, and must be titrated and weaned. Used primarily as 1) adjuvant during opioid and benzodiazepine weaning for refractory withdrawal, 2) adjuvant to sedate patients with agitation on mechanical ventilation who are refractory to standard management.\n\nNon-analgesic adjuvants\n\nSedatives and anxiolytic medications are often prescribed to induce sleep for diagnostic procedures, calm irritable infants, or along with analgesics to manage pain related agitation. They are also helpful to relieve agitation during mechanical ventilation, and can suppress patients' central respiratory drive in order to achieve synchrony with the ventilator.",

Although clinically effective, it is important to realize that it is metabolized into 2 toxic metabolites with half-lives >72 hrs: trichloroethanol competes for glucoronidation and can worsen hyperbilirubinemia; trichloroacetic acid has been shown to be carcinogenic in mice. Because of these concerns, repeated or regular dosing over long periods of time is not recommended.\n\ni. Dose: 25-50 mg/kg PO/PR.",

In one study, critically ill preterm neonates were found to experience 700 painful procedures by the time of discharge, and as many as 7-17painful procedures in a day! Peak exposure occurs during the first few days of admission, and in those receiving respiratory support. Below you will find recommendations and ideas for various procedures.",

What is aEEG?\n\naEEG is a simplified, bedside EEG device used to continuously monitor brain function. Brain wave activity is recorded from scalp electrodes and the raw EEG data is processed using a filter to attenuate frequencies <2Hz and >15Hz, amplitudes are transformed into a rectified and time-compressed signal and displayed on a semi-logarithmic scale in microVolts (µV). Interpretation of the aEEG recording includes assessment of the minimum amplitude, maximum amplitude, bandwidth, and the presence of sleep-wake cycles (SWC). This results in patterns that are easily recognizable without formal training in EEG analysis.\n\n### B. Indications for aEEG monitoring\n\n1. Confirmation of suspected clinical seizures, especially when formal continuous EEG is not available\n2. Assessment for subclinical seizures in high risk infants (e.g. preterm with severe IVH)\n3. Continuous monitoring of therapeutic effects of anti-epileptic medication\n4. Prediction of outcomes in hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE)\n5. Other potential, but not well-studied, uses for aEEG include: metabolic encephalopathy, patients on ECMO, assessment of neuromaturation in preterm infants, assessment of post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus, surgical anesthesia and post-operative recovery",

Hydrogel: most commercial aEEG devices utilize these disposable electrodes which are similar to regular EKG electrodes\n    b.  Cup-disk or spider: reusable; requires EEG conductive paste (Ten20 paste)\n    c.  Needle: minimal skin preparation required and achieves low impedances; invasive, with theoretical risk for infection\n\n2.  Recording montages: Location of electrodes based on the 10-20 international classification system modified for neonates (Figure 1)\n    a.  Single channel: traditionally, electrodes are positioned at P3 and P4, which is the area overlying the cortical watershed zone in infants with HIE.\n    b.  Three channel: electrodes positioned at C3, P3, C4, P4 create two bi-parietal channels (C3-P3, C4-P4) and a cross-cerebral channel (P3-P4). This is most commonly used at LPCH.\n    c.  All devices require an additional ground electrode, usually placed on the upper back (preferred) or forehead. Some devices may additionally require a reference electrode on the scalp (typically Cz)\n    d.  Other EEG recording systems may utilize additional channels",

It has most commonly been used for cerebral oximetry, although monitoring of renal and mesenteric oxygenation are other potential applications. A skin sensor transmits near-infrared light, which penetrates underlying tissues to a depth of 2.5 to 3 cm. Light is differentially absorbed by oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin from the tissue vasculature, and remaining light is then detected by the sensor. A regional tissue oxygen saturation (rSO2) is then calculated based on a weighted average of 20% arterial blood, 75% venous blood, and 5% capillary blood in the underlying tissue. The rSO2 value reflects a regional balance between tissue oxygen supply and demand.\n\nB. **Indications for 2-site NIRS monitoring (and admission to NeuroNICU)**\n\n1. Conditions with altered hemodynamic states causing cerebral hypoxemia\n   a. Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy\n   b. Congenital heart disease- especially with decreased systemic outflow for peri-operative monitoring\n   c. Prematurity with altered cerebral autoregulation. All preterm infants <29 weeks gestation undergo NIRS monitoring for the first week of life.\n   d. Hypoxic respiratory failure or pre-ECMO\n\n2. Conditions with altered hemodynamics affecting mesenteric or renal oxygenation\n   a. Shock- Drop in somatic oxygenation may be an early potential indicator of low cardiac output before other indicators like blood pressure, acidosis, and decreased urine output",

Over the last several decades, survival rates have improved across many diagnostic groups admitted to the NICU, however the rates of neurologic and neurodevelopmental impairment are increasing with life-long effects on survivors and their families. The Neuro NICU was developed to improve the care of newborns with brain injury or at risk for brain injury. Another stimulus was the expertise developed over the last decade at LPCH in the areas of therapeutic hypothermia, aEEG, NIRS, neuroradiology, prenatal diagnosis, and high-risk infant follow-up.",

Neonates are at high risk for seizure in a number of clinical scenarios:\n1. HIE (40-60% have seizures)\n2. ECMO (10-20% have seizures)\n3. S/P certain cardiac surgeries (5-20%)\n4. Stroke/hemorrhage/SVT (~80% of neonatal stroke presents as seizure)\n5. CNS Infections\n6. Genetic/metabolic conditions\n\nB. All neonates with clinically suspected seizures should receive immediate aEEG and urgent Video EEG (VEEG) monitoring for confirmation of diagnosis and ongoing management. Separate aEEG should be discontinued when VEEG is initiated-- aEEG trends can be displayed at bedside using most of the VEEG machines, and technical problems arise if both sets of electrodes are used simultaneously.\n1. 80-90% of neonatal seizures are **subclinical**, with no outward signs, and can only be diagnosed by VEEG/aEEG.\n2. Up to 50% of abnormal movements suspected to be seizures in NICU babies are **not** seizures on EEG, but rather are seizure mimics.\n3. aEEG is initiated by the NICU team.\na. aEEG is interpreted at the bedside on an ongoing basis by NICU staff\nb. When interpreted by experienced users, aEEG identifies about 2/3 of patients with seizures, but is less accurate for identifying (quantifying) individual seizures.\nc. aEEG is a great option for immediate monitoring to see if a baby is having any seizures, until the EEG tech arrives to start vEEG for precise diagnosis.\n4. To request video EEG monitoring (including urgent vEEG at night and on weekends if available), the NICU fellow/attending should page the neurology resident on call. Ordering VEEG in Epic will **not** initiate vEEG without this conversation.\na. If clinically suspected seizure occurs while on video EEG, press the event button to mark the event on the EEG file, and write a description on the bedside log.\nb. If seizures are suspected based on aEEG changes, enter in comment at bedside (if aEEG machine), or push event button to mark area of concern (if vEEG machine)\nc. The neurology team should be contacted to review events as needed to confirm whether or not they are seizures. Otherwise, VEEG is reviewed at least twice daily by the EEG attending, and daily reports are posted in EPIC.\n\n<a id='f2d58b7b-738b-493f-915b-e78c5e70d53a'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

A number of sudden, stereotyped clinical events raise suspicion for seizures:\n\n1.  Autonomic changes\n    a. Unexplained apnea in a term baby is a seizure until proven otherwise.\n    b. Isolated heart rate or blood pressure changes are rarely seizures.\n\n2.  Focal clonic, tonic movements\n    a. More likely seizure if they are high amplitude, regular frequency, and cannot be suppressed\n    b. Less likely seizure if elicited by positioning/movement, involve all extremities, and can be stopped with restraint or passive flexion\n    c. Benign sleep myoclonus can last for several minutes and be a close seizure mimic; it is distinguished from seizures by only occurring in sleep in an otherwise healthy baby\n\n3.  Forced eye/gaze deviation\n\n4.  Tonic stiffening\n\n<a id='e6159d0d-a9f5-43b2-805f-805531eb2144'></a>\n\n## II. Seizure Types\n\nA. Subclinical & Subtle: most common type in newborns. Occur in both term and premature infants. Clinical manifestations may be absent entirely, or if present include:\n\n1.  Ocular movements: conjugate horizontal deviation, repetitive blinking or fluttering of eyelids, sustained eye opening with ocular fixation\n2.  Oral-buccal-lingual movements: chewing, drooling, sucking, tongue thrusting\n3.  Bicycling/pedaling/swimming movements of extremities\n4.  Apnea\n5.  Autonomic changes: combination of blood pressure changes, tachycardia, in combination with apnea/respiratory changes.\n\nB. Multifocal/focal clonic\n\n1.  Most common overt clinical seizure type in newborns\n2.  Clinical manifestations include rhythmic jerking of one or more body parts\n3.  Not the same as \"generalized tonic-clonic\", which describes convulsive seizures in children/adults\n\nC. Tonic\n\n1.  Clinical manifestations include tonic extension of all limbs, resembling decerebrate posturing, occasionally accompanied by subtle signs (e.g. apnea, eye changes)\n2.  Can be focal or generalized\n\n<a id='bf9623ac-c5a3-4d6a-82cb-cfa37ce6ee43'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Myoclonic\n1. Rare seizure type, occurs primarily in catastrophic epilepsy\n2. Almost always seen in conjunction with very abnormal EEG and exam\n\n<a id='e2d61cff-034d-4ecf-84ba-cf99b667366b'></a>\n\n### III. Etiologies of Neonatal Seizures\n\nA. Acute Symptomatic- About 80% of neonatal seizures are acute symptomatic seizures, meaning they reflect acute brain injury/disturbance. Identifying the underlying cause is key.\n\n1.  **Hypoxic-ischemic injury**: HIE is the most common cause of seizures in first few days or life (50%)\n2.  **Stroke**- 2nd most common cause\n    a. Arterial Ischemic\n    b. Intracranial hemorrhage:\n        i. Subarachnoid: usually otherwise asymptomatic (\"well baby with seziures\")\n        ii. Intraventricular: associated with prematurity\n        iii. Subdural: associated with traumatic delivery\n    c. Sinovenous thrombosis – may be evident from Doppler flow on HUS or MRV\n3.  **Hypoglycemia**: occurs in association with SGA, IDM, and/or asphyxia.\n4.  **Hypocalcemia**: occurs in association with prematurity, IDM, asphyxia, hypoparathyroidism, DiGeorge/VCF syndrome (22q11.2 deletion), cardiac anomalies.\n5.  **Other electrolyte abnormalities**: hypomagnesemia, hypo/hypernatremia.\n6.  **CNS infection**: meningitis, encephalitis, brain abscess, congenital TORCH, Zika\n7.  **Developmental defects**: cortical dysgenesis\n\n<a id='590c7cef-6981-45c3-a79a-1d588b660b66'></a>\n\nB. **Neonatal Onset Epilepsy**- 20% of neonatal seizures are due to underlying chronic/congenital conditions that are likely to result in ongoing epilepsy. When MRI is normal and no cause of acute symptomatic seizures is found, >50% of babies will have a confirmed genetic diagnosis if testing is performed.\n\n1.  **Genetic & Metabolic syndromes**: includes benign familial neonatal seizures due to KCNQ2 or other mutations, inborn errors of metabolism, pyridoxine-dependent seizures, DEND (developmental delay, epilepsy, and neonatal diabetes).\n2.  **Brain malformation syndromes**\n\n<a id='119847bb-aeda-4f74-9edf-53751804f000'></a>\n\nIV. **Evaluation**\n\nA. Acute diagnostic tests: check STAT electrolytes, Ca, glucose, Mg:\nB. Electrolytes\n\n<a id='7492ec97-9fb9-4d6f-9bad-0d75a5e68fe2'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

If hypoglycemic (<40 mg/dl), give 2-3 ml/kg D10W IVP then start or increase IV glucose infusion to give at least 7-8 mg/kg/min.\n2. If hypocalcemic, give 10-20 mg/kg Calcium chloride IV push.\n3. If hypomagnesemic give 25-50 mg/kg Magnesium sulfate IV.\n\n**C. First line diagnostic tests** include:\n1. CBC\n2. Urine Toxic Screen\n3. Complete Metabolic Panel\n4. Lactate\n5. Blood culture\n6. Head ultrasound- Head Ultrasound is useful for excluding hemorrhage and for initial images while awaiting MRI, and for serial imaging. EEG electrodes are not a contraindication to HUS- it can be performed by moving one electrode, and does not require discontinuing VEEG.\n\n**D. Head imaging** – Indicated as soon as possible (when baby stable and MRI available) for neonates with seizures. It will provide a diagnosis in ~90% of cases of neonatal seizures. MRI is preferred for resolution and multidimensional imaging and possibility of MRA and MRV. Head CT should be used very rarely, when immediate imaging is needed and neither HUS nor MRI is possible.\n\n**E. Revisit family history** after parents have checked with family; often new information comes out after a baby has seizures.\n\n**F. Additional tests to consider** (depending on clinical situation)\n1. Lumbar puncture - to rule out infection (bacterial & viral studies), hemorrhage. Send glucose with a paired serum glucose sample. If possible, consider sending additional CSF test (below) from LP, or saving CSF for additional studies\n2. TORCH titers & Zika\n3. ABG\n4. Ammonia, lactate with paired pyruvate\n5. Serum amino acids, urine organic acids, acylcarnitine profile, free/total carnitine.\n\n**G. Testing for Genetic/Metabolic causes** Genetic testing identifies the cause of neonatal seizures in >50% of neonates at LPCH who have seizures but normal MRI, and may influence treatment choice. Discuss with neurology to select those tests relevant to the individual patient.\n1. Serum biotinidase, uric acid, acylcarnitine panel, carnitine (free and total), very long chain fatty acids, pipecolic acid. alpha-AASA, guanidinoacetate/creatine\n2. Urine – sulfocysteine, alpha-AASA, guanidinoacetate/creatine, pyr/pur panel\n\n<a id='8b09ad0a-b86a-4026-8697-d4ab6e128181'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Epi\n\n<a id='7b7c1688-8fe2-40e5-94be-e65e0d18b885'></a>\n\nI. **Definition**\n\nTogether, intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and periventricular lesions are the most common types of neonatal intracranial pathology and are associated primarily with prematurity. The incidence of IVH in premature infants has declined in the past 20 yrs from 40% of all premature births to around 25%, in part due to antenatal steroid administration. The incidence increases with decreasing gestational age. IVH becomes much more common at <28 wks gestation and is rare after 34 wks gestation. If an IVH is to occur, the early stages are detected in 90% of infants before 4 days of age and 99% by 10 days of age. Extension of IVH occurs typically by 2-4 wks of age.\n\n<a id='fbc49bbb-346b-432e-bebc-2ca7a5a05943'></a>\n\n## II. Etiology\n\nIVH in the premature infant arises from the germinal matrix (GM). This is a periventricular structure located between the caudate nucleus and the thalamus. It contains a fine vascular network devoid of supportive stroma. The GM undergoes a progressive decrease in size as gestational age increases, with nearly complete involution by approximately 36 wks. As preterm infants are at high risk for impaired cerebrovascular autoregulation, a host of factors (e.g., anemia, volume resuscitation, pneumothorax, CPR, hypercarbia, and acidosis), whose common endpoint is abnormally increased cerebral blood flow, leads to rupture of the delicate blood vessels of the GM. Also implicated as potential etiologies are infection/inflammation that can affect vessel fragility, changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) that may occur with PDA, and a decrease in CBF that may be associated with hyperventilation and hypocarbia.\n\n<a id='4ee21561-53d8-4194-bb69-50bccbdd27d3'></a>\n\n### III. Classification of IVH\n\nA. The Papile ultrasound grading system has historically been used (somewhat imperfectly) to predict long-term neurologic outcome, risk for hydrocephalus, and survival.\n\n1. Grade I: Bleeding limited to the subependymal or germinal matrix layer and the choroid plexus.\n2. Grade II: Bleeding extending into the ventricles that may fill the ventricle but not cause dilation.\n3. Grade III: Bleeding into the ventricles that directly causes dilatation of the ventricles but no extension into brain parenchyma. This should be distinguished from Grade II with subsequent post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus.\n4. Grade IV: Bleeding that extends into the brain parenchyma.\n\n<a id='51353460-8e8b-437a-b875-1e50447d6fbe'></a>\n\nB. More recently at LPCH, radiologists have chosen to describe the constellation of findings seen on cranial ultrasound including location and size of any bleeding, dilatation (or narrowing) of ventricles, and any evidence of edema or any structural abnormalities that are appreciated. Intraparenchymal echodensity may also be used to describe a periventricular hemorrhagic infarction (PVHI), which rather than a traditional Grade IV extension of bleeding into the parenchyma, instead reflects obstruction of venous flow and venous infarction. It is important to review findings with a radiologist to distinguish these differences for better prognostication. In addition, there may be documentation of the resistive index (RI) of the middle cerebral artery:\n\nRI = (Peak systolic velocity - End diastolic velocity)/ (Peak systolic velocity)\n\n<a id='3c8ae7ce-e29f-4811-9dca-55661a0fa25f'></a>\n\nRI of less than 0.5-0.6 in the neonatal period is associated with adverse neurological outcomes at 1-2 yrs of age. High RI may indicate increased intracranial pressure. RI may also be affected by the presence of a PDA or other cardiac anomalies.\n\n<a id='fe721191-d029-4883-bd1d-733a64642964'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

It may present asymptomatically or with severe neurologic signs such as lethargy or seizures. It may be reflected by a drop in hematocrit, hypotension or by metabolic acidosis. Some longer-term effects include:\n\n<a id='13acce16-0656-40b8-aaef-f4ad752c6edb'></a>\n\nA. Post hemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH) occurs in up to 1/3-1/2 of patients with grade III or IV IVH, but occurs rarely in less severe IVH. The hallmarks are progressive ventricular dilatation and abnormal increase in OFC. Treatment can include close monitoring, serial LPs, ventriculostomy, and mechanical shunting depending upon response to non-surgical management and/or the presence of signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure. Signs of increased ICP in the neonate include: OFC increase >1-1.5 cm/wk, tense anterior fontanelle, cranial suture separation or neurologic signs such as decreased alertness, apnea, seizures or sun-setting (downward gaze of eyes). aEEG monitoring may demonstrate increased discontinuity and loss of sleep-wake cycling with progressive hydrocephalus.\n\nB. Periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) is a generally symmetric, non-hemorrhagic, and ischemic white matter injury of the premature brain. As premature infants have relatively pressure-passive blood-brain barrier integrity, changes in systemic BP may be more likely to lead to changes in CBF with resultant PVL. It leads to necrosis in the periventricular white matter and secondary enlargement of the lateral ventricles. This disorder is often associated with IVH and with factors that predispose to IVH. Cytokine-mediated inflammation may also play a distinct role in the development of PVL. PVL is commonly associated with neurologic handicap (primarily the spastic diplegia form of cerebral palsy). It can be diagnosed most reliably by MRI but can also be detected in most cases by ultrasound as periventricular echodensities or cystic lesions.\n\nC. Neuromotor sequelae: Major IVH is associated strongly with neuromotor handicaps ranging from minor to severe. Definite neurologic sequelae are seen in 25-50% of cases with severe grade III & IV, but in only 5- 15% of grade I to II hemorrhage (which is about the same rate as preterm infants without identified IVH). However, recent literature suggests that even grade I to II IVH may lead to increased risks for neurodevelopmental impairment. Infants with bilateral IVH or those who require a shunt are at significantly higher risk for neurologic sequelae.\n\n<a id='9b1a95cf-109b-401b-bdf4-44c5b48aab7f'></a>\n\nV. **Diagnosis of IVH**\n\nA. Cranial ultrasound:\n\n1. A screening head ultrasound is indicated for infants with a birth weight <1500 grams and/or gestational age < 32 weeks at 7-10 days of age. Earlier scanning may be indicated by clinical suspicion and/or when withdrawal of intensive care support is being considered. A screening head ultrasound may also be indicated for infants of higher birth weight or gestational age, depending on the clinical scenario (e.g. twin-twin transfusion, need for CPR, or significant clinical instability).\n2. No follow-up is recommended for minimally abnormal head ultrasound (Grade I or II) after 1 week of age.\n3. Patients with a significant bleeding into the ventricle (i.e., grade II or III) may need at least 1 subsequent cranial ultrasound to evaluate for post-hemorrhagic ventricular dilatation that may evolve into post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus.\n4. Follow-up may be indicated for critically ill patients or ELBW (<750 gm) at the discretion of the attending.\n5. Weekly measures of OFC should be performed on all patients, with more frequent measurements on those patients with severe IVH.\n6. Infants with severe IVH (grade III or IV) are at higher risk for clinical or subclinical seizures, and aEEG monitoring for minimum of 24 h should be performed to screen for epileptic activity.

Serial ultrasounds have been recommended for all patients in the past with IVH; however, serial ultrasounds (every 5-10 days) should be reserved for those infants with the following risk factors:\n\n1. Clinical signs of increased ICP.\n2. Severe IVH on initial scan.\n3. Patient receiving ongoing interventions (e.g., medication, LP) to assess efficacy of therapy.\n\n<a id='b560f58b-be9a-4772-866c-f56a228df8a6'></a>\n\nVI. \"Premature\" MRI Protocol\n\nA. Recent developments in MR imaging (e.g., diffusion-weighted imaging and diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI and DWI)) allow for better quantification of brain size and myelinization. MRI is likely the most sensitive and accurate modality for imaging PVL. We try to obtain DTI/DWI in all premature infants once they are >35-36 wks corrected gestational age. This is usually best done when they are stable in an open crib and requiring no more than supplemental oxygen for respiratory support. Besides premature infants (BW <1500 gm or GA<32 weeks), other babies at high risk for CNS injury (e.g. infants with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, metabolic disorder, or post-ECMO support) may also be candidates for an MRI study.\n\nB. Infants needing an MRI usually are done as a \"feed and bundle\" (feed the infant just prior to and swaddle them during the scan). If this is unsuccessful, then the infant must be rescheduled. With second attempt, infant should be made NPO and sedation given. This must be done per the moderate sedation protocol. The infant must never be given sedation without being NPO for an MRI. The Pediatric Anesthesia Service may be consulted for those patients needing sedation.\n\n<a id='699c4ea2-6cf5-49b3-9827-be1be5658579'></a>\n\nReferences:\n\n1. Papile LA et al.

Definition\n\nRetinopathy of prematurity (ROP) refers to the abnormal growth of blood vessels in the retina of premature infants. The incidence of ROP increases with decreasing gestational age and lower birth weight. In its most severe state, ROP leads to scarring and retinal detachment, and subsequently visual impairment and blindness.\n\n<a id='0a5d43f5-43d1-43f4-9f50-f00d32140ffe'></a>\n\nII. **Etiology**\n\nROP is a multifactorial disease. The most important risk factor for developing ROP is prematurity. Several other risk factors have been identified, such as: low birth weight; oxygen use; assisted ventilation for over one week; severity of illness; high blood transfusion volume; and hyperglycemia. 1-5 Elevated arterial oxygen tension with paO2 > 80 mm Hg is thought to contribute to development of ROP, but the SUPPORT trial demonstrated increased risk of mortality in infants exposed to lower O2 saturation goals in attempts to reduce ROP.\n\n<a id='02b4c5cc-d400-4cd0-9d00-7ff630dd9b32'></a>\n\n### III. Classification of ROP\n\nClassification of ROP is based on staging of the disease (stage 1-5), location of involvement of the retina (Zone I-III), extent of retinal involvement (1-12 clock hours), and presence or absence of plus disease.\n\n#### A. Stage\n\n1.  Stage 1: Flat white line demarcating the vascular and avascular retina\n2.  Stage 2: Formation of a ridge of fibrous tissue between the vascular and avascular retina\n3.  Stage 3: Growth of new blood vessels and fibrous tissue along the ridge and into the vitreous\n4.  Stage 4: Partial retinal detachment\n5.  Stage 5: Total retinal detachment\n\n<a id='68b68ff4-0d50-4432-afaa-face06388899'></a>\n\nB. Zones\n<::Diagram of the left eye showing concentric zones and anatomical landmarks.

Prevention\n\nInterventions to prevent ROP have been largely unsuccessful or associated with other adverse outcomes. Prompt detection and treatment is the best way to preserve vision.\n\nA. PaO2 ≥80 mm Hg in the first 2 wks of life has been shown to increase the risk of development of severe ROP, however decreased target oxygenation saturation has been associated with increased mortality.\n\nB. In the STOP-ROP trial infants were maintained with O2 sats either 89-94% (conventional) or 96-99% (supplemental). Although there was a trend towards a decrease in conversion from prethreshold to threshold ROP in the supplemental group, the results were not statistically significant. However, in the group with no Plus disease, there was a statistically significant benefit in infants in the supplemental group (46% vs 32%). However, supplemental oxygen increased the risk of adverse pulmonary events.\n\nC. In the SUPPORT and BOOST II trials infants were maintained with O2 sats 85-89% (low sat arm) or 91-95% (high sat arm). ROP was reduced in the low sat arm (85-89%) however, the risk of death was higher. The BOOST II trial also found a higher rate of NEC in the low sat arm.\n\nD. In the LPCH NICU, infants who reach prethreshold stage 2 or 3 ROP are managed with a combination of increased oxygen saturation levels (97-100%), correction of anemia (Hct ≥40%) and exposure to room light (i.e. removing the cover on the isolette to reduce rod photoreceptor oxygen consumption). These interventions aim to down-regulate pathologically elevated levels of VEGF.\n\n<a id='90b4dcde-eca2-4e0b-b6fd-c2cf44de7640'></a>\n\n**VIII.

For infants without ROP see Oxygen Saturation Guidelines chapter.\n\nB. **Pre-Threshold ROP (when diagnosed by Ophthalmology)**. At the time of detection of prethreshold ROP, the retinal specialist will consult with the Neonatologist on service regarding the findings, and supplemental oxygen MAY be ordered by the Neonatologist to maintain pulse oximetry saturations SpO2 ≥97%\n\n1. In oxygen\n   a. Target oxygen saturations: 97-99%\n   b. Pulse oximeter alarm limits: 95% and 99%\n\n2. In room air\n   a. Target oxygen saturations: 97-100%\n   b.

Avastin (Bevacizumab)\n\nIntravitereal injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy such as Avastin have become a new treatment modality for ROP10 as it is a shorter procedure with need for only topical anesthesia versus intubation and sedation needed for laser therapy. A multicenter randomized controlled trial BEAT-ROP11 also demonstrated a reduced recurrence of ROP at 54 weeks when compared to laser treatment for zone I ROP and decreased rates of severe high myopia at 2.5 years. Laser therapy may still be required if patients do not respond to the injection, or if ROP worsens after the injection.\n\nRecently, concerns have been raised about systemic absorption of Avastin and potential harmful effects on developing tissues, specifically the brain. A recent study by the Canadian Neonatal Network12 showed that premature infants treated with Avastin had higher odds of severe neurodevelopmental disabilities at 18 months, and a statistically significantly lower Bayley motor composite score. Caution should be used when deciding between treatment with Avastin versus laser therapy.\n\n<a id='10c4271d-cfbb-4a06-b754-008a676e49dc'></a>\n\nXI. **Ophthalmology Consultants**\n\nA.

CSF pathway:\n\n1.  CSF is produced in the choroid plexus and cerebral tissue.\n    a. Normal rate of CSF production is about 18mL/hour.\n2.  CSF circulates through the ventricular system into the subarachnoid space.\n    Lateral ventricles → foramen of Monro midline →3rd ventricle → aqueduct of Sylvius → 4th ventricle → to subarachnoid spaces via paired lateral foramina of Luschka and midline foramen of Magendie.\n3.  There are large areas within the subarachnoid space called cisterns where CSF collects.\n    a. Basal cisterns connect the intracranial and spinal subarachnoid spaces.\n\n<::Lateral ventricules\nThird ventricule\nAcqueduc of Sylvius\nForamen of Monroe\nFourth ventricule\nForamen (openings) of\nLuschke and Magendie\n: figure::>\n\n<a id='0dac99c0-8be8-4742-af89-5b91747d6b0f'></a>\n\nB. Hydrocephalus is an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the ventricles of the brain or subarachnoid spaces. It can be congenital (about 1 out of 1000 live births). Common causes of congenital hydrocephalus include aqueductal stenosis, spina bifida, arachnoid cysts, Dandy-Walker syndrome and Chiari malformation. Common causes of acquired hydrocephalus include intraventricular hemorrhage, brain tumors, infection or head trauma.\n\n1.  Non-communicating hydrocephalus or obstructive hydrocephalus: blockage within the CSF pathway or within the subarachnoid spaces.\n    a. Most common is aqueductal stenosis. The aqueduct of Sylvius is the narrow pathway between the 3rd and 4th ventricle. A child may be born with abnormally narrowed aqueduct or aqueductal webbing. It can also be blocked from infection, hemorrhage or from a tumor. This results in enlargement of the lateral and 3rd ventricles.\n2.  Communicating hydrocephalus: impaired reabsorption of CSF within the arachnoid villi, basal cisterns, and subarachnoid spaces. A rare cause of CSF overproduction can occur with choroid plexus papilloma.\n\n<a id='4e44479a-cda5-4478-8f0d-26b7161be70e'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Clinical signs include:\n\n1.  Rapidly increasing head circumference in a child with patent cranial sutures\n2.  Full, bulging fontanel that can be soft or tense. It does not fluctuate with position or when the child is calm.\n3.  Disconjugate gaze or sunsetting sign of the eyes (upgaze paresis).\n4.  Increase sleepiness, difficult to arouse, lethargic\n5.  Nausea/vomiting with no other associated illness or causes.\n6.  Failure to thrive\n7.  Slow development\n\nB. Diagnostic Studies\n\n1.  Head ultrasound\n2.  Brain MRI\n    a. Full brain MRI without contrast often for initial study\n    b. Full brain MRI with and without contrast if a mass is noted\n    c. Head CT often for acute symptoms or patients with adjustable valve\n3.  Follow up study: Fast brain MRI without contrast (limited sequences that can be done within minutes, no sedation needed). Does not require patient to be NPO.\n\n<a id='f0891306-565f-4333-b05e-dd44fdda854b'></a>\n\n### III. Management of Hydrocephalus in the Neonate\n\nA. Ventricular reservoir is a ventricular access device (VAD) used as a bridge to VP shunt in neonates who are too small for VP shunt or have other medical issues that need to be addressed.\n\n1. A VAD can be used for serial therapeutic taps for management of hydrocephalus\n\na. Intraventricular hemorrhage: while waiting for the CSF to clear from the hemorrhage, remove elevated protein and debris.\n\nb. Use as temporary management of symptoms while continuing to evaluate need for VP shunt.\n\nB. Endoscopic Third Ventriculostomy (ETV) and Choroid Plexus Cauterizaton (CPC)\n\n1. Alternative to CSF shunting in infants with hydrocephalus\n\n2. ETV: use of endoscopy to create an internal pathway for CSF diversion through the floor of the third ventricle. This procedure allows the ventricular CSF to bypass anatomic obstructions and directly enter, and be absorbed through, the subarachnoid space via the hole created in the floor of the third ventricle.\n\n<a id='762ddcf7-a575-4505-8a71-6c29d524962f'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

About 30% of children do not respond well to the procedure and subsequently require a shunt.\nSuccess rate is higher in children older than 1 year of age.\n\n<a id='71da0026-fb53-48a5-914e-54a43f3587ab'></a>\n\n3.\nb. Deficient CSF resorption is thought to attribute to low ETV success rate in young infants.\nCPC: endoscopic cauterization of the choroid plexus at time of ETV can augment the deficient CSF resorption\n\n<a id='59e89480-448d-41de-859b-aa29d3065bfe'></a>\n\nC. Ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VP shunt):\n1. Components of shunt:\n   a. Proximal catheter is radiopaque and placed in one of the lateral ventricles.\n   b. The valve allows for unidirectional CSF flow and contains a reservoir that allows evaluation of ICP and sampling of CSF.\n   c. Distal catheter end is primarily placed into the peritoneum or, if clinically indicated, in other absorptive cavities such as the atrium or pleural space.\n      i. Ventriculoperitoneal shunt\n      ii. Ventriculopleural shunt\n      iii. Ventriculo atrial shunt\n\n<a id='bb9efe9a-9109-46da-99c3-ee39265eccee'></a>\n\n## IV. Shunt Valve Types\n\nA. Fixed-pressure (nonprogrammable) valve regulates the flow of CSF based on a pre-determined pressure setting.\n    1. Necessitates shunt revision when the patient's pressure/flow requirement changes\n\nB. Adjustable pressure (programmable) valve regulates the flow of CSF based on a pressure setting that can be adjusted with a powerful external magnetic device. An MRI scan can change the setting of a programmable shunt and requires Neurosurgery Service to check the setting of valve after the MRI scan is completed. There are now adjustable valves that are compatible with MRI up to 3.0 Tesla.\n\n<a id='cd71ac4e-a36d-478e-b04a-abc730574c8c'></a>\n\nV. **Complications**\n\nA. Shunt Failure – obstruction along any portion of the shunt system. Insufficient or over drainage with current valve.\n\nB. Disconnection – usually neck area, often in cervical junction with longstanding shunts, should be able to palpate area of disconnection and fluid along the shunt tract. Shunt series plain film x-ray can help evaluate for disconnections.\n\nC. Migration – catheter migrates out of ventricle or out of peritoneal space (inguinal hernia).\n\nD. Infection – may require externalization of the shunt to a drain until infection is treated.\n\n   1. Meningitis – literature indicates two-thirds of cases caused by S. epidermidis and S. aureus\n\n<a id='5fde8adc-fc28-40a2-9025-b6da97ac20f3'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

On rare occasion, infection can occur from a ruptured appendix or ruptured abdominal viscera\n\nE. Underdrainage or Overdrainage - Both can result in similar symptoms.\n\n   1. Overdrainage - When too much CSF is drained compared with the amount of CSF being produced, the cortical mantle can collapse causing subdural fluid collections. Subdural fluid can cause acute hematoma and cause a life-threatening situation, especially in the infant with small blood volumes and large heads. For older children who can describe their headaches, headaches are worse with upright position and better flat.\n\n   2. Underdrainage - can cause recurrent hydrocephalus. Headaches are worse when flat and better upright.\n\n   3. Loculations - usually caused by infection or ventriculitis, causing catheter occlusion, and will result in increased ICP.\n\n<a id='870b03c2-310b-4f8d-9d56-ef90c7d2762c'></a>\n\nVI. **Management of an Infected Shunt in the Neonate**\n\nA. Obtain CSF culture (aerobic/anaerobic) and gram stain, serial blood cultures, urine culture, CBC with differential, CRP CP ESR.\n\nB. Initiate broad spectrum antibiotics.\n\nC. Once organism is isolated and antibiotic sensitivities are available, adjust antibiotics as indicated.\n\nD. Externalize shunt or remove shunt completely, monitoring head circumference and signs of increased ICP.\n\n<a id='53cdcbf0-163c-44fa-b2f0-b7595241c408'></a>\n\n## VII. Tapping a Ventricular Reservoir\n\nA. Performed only by Neurosurgery Team\n\nB. Equipment: 25-gauge butterfly needles, syringe, sterile gloves, betadine prep, gauze and mask.\n\nC. For patients requiring interval tapping: obtain surveillance head ultrasound every Monday and Thursday, to monitor ventricle size AND weekly full CSF panel.\n\n<a id='dcdb6aa6-d0fd-487a-9afb-c04463e4ccd4'></a>\n\nVIII. **Daily Nursing Considerations/Management**\n\nA. Daily head circumference measurement.\n\nB. Assess fontanels routinely in an upright position and when infant is not irritable.\n\nC. Routine vital signs, including temperature.\n\nD. Monitor for signs and symptoms of increased ICP: nausea, vomiting, lethargy, irritability, disconjugate gaze, any change in mental status, and depressed respiratory status.\n\nE. Assess entire shunt tract for fluid collection, erythema, and tenderness.\n\nF. Rotate head every 2-3 hours and avoid direct pressure to VP shunt to prevent skin breakdown.\n\nG. Typically a fast brain MRI without contrast is done after a VP shunt placement for baseline ventricle size.\n\n<a id='e804721b-13b0-4c2b-bd65-7a97cceb436e'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Consult with Neurosurgery Team prior to discharging patient.\n\nB. Family should have instructions on signs and symptoms to look for.\n\nC. Follow-up is often 2 weeks after hospital discharge for ETV/CPC or complicated patients and 3-4 weeks for other patients. Patients may need a head ultrasound or fast MRI prior to clinic appointment.\n\nD. VP shunt patients who live far away should be discharged with a copy of most recent neuroimaging scan in case of an emergency. Order a CD with the images through radiology film library.\n\n<a id='120b6e77-837a-4c15-bb11-02fc35f30917'></a>\n\nFor any questions, during the day, please page the Neurosurgery resident on service/Fellow/or Attending physician.

A meta-analysis of 1214 infants enrolled in 7 trials concluded that reduction in body temperature to 33-34° C in infants ≥36 weeks gestation with moderate to severe HIE results in significant reductions in the risk of death or major neurodevelopmental disability at 18 months of age (RR 0.76 95% CI 0.69-0.84) and an increase in the rate of survival with normal neurologic function.1 The number need to treat (NNT) is 7. The reduction in death or major neurodevelopmental disability was greatest in those with moderate HIE (RR 0.67 95% CI 0.56-0.81) when compared with those with severe HIE (RR 0.83 95% CI 0.74-0.92). The reduction in adverse outcomes was very similar for total body hypothermia and selective head cooling. Side effects of cooling are limited to bradycardia and thrombocytopenia, however neither is clinically significant. There is a higher rate of PPHN in cooled infants however the difference is not statistically significant but may be clinically important.2,3\n\n<a id='842f0e9a-ba13-4ca6-b0ce-9fab56291d84'></a>\n\nAt LPCH more than 75% of our neonates who undergo therapeutic hypothermia are transported to our NICU from referring hospitals. During transport to LPCH, a portable cooling device (Tecotherm Neo) is utilized to initiate active cooling prior to admission to LPCH. Most patients reach target temperature prior to arriving at LPCH.\n\n<a id='1c988323-e7cd-4fe1-b123-cc489d5688ff'></a>\n\nThe Late Hypothermia trial enrolled newborns with moderate to severe encephalopathy who had cooling initiated at 6-24 hours of age. Infants were randomized to cooling for **96 hours** to a temperature of 33-34°C or to control. Bayesian analysis indicates that there is benefit; however, this benefit was less than that if treated by 6 hours after birth. Late Hypothermia provides a 76% chance of a lower rate of death or disability, but the extent of the benefit is uncertain. Given there are no other treatments available and the risks associated with this therapy are minimal, we recommend performing therapeutic hypothermia on qualifying infants.\n\n<a id='bb82f4a8-6ff8-428e-a9a1-41d4427c9d1a'></a>\n\nII. **ACTIVE TRIALS FOR NEWBORNS WITH HIE AT LPCH.** Please page research @15340 as soon as a potential HIE study patient is identified (i.e. at the time transport is accepted). For study-specific enrollment criteria, please consult the reminder cards distributed by research or the NICU attending office bulletin board.\n\nA. A Randomized Trial of Targeted Temperature Management with Whole Body Hypothermia for Moderate and Severe Neonatal Encephalopathy in Premature Infants 33-25 Weeks Gestational Age-A Bayesian Study (Preemie Cooling)\n\nPreemie Cooling will determine if whole body cooling will improve survival and reduce disability in babies with HIE born at 330/7 to 356/7 weeks, presenting within 6 hours of birth. Patients will be randomized to an intervention arm with a temperature of 33.5°C for 72 hours or to a control arm with temperatures 36.5°-37.3°C with active intervention for temperatures >37.3°C.\n\nB. High Dose Erythropoietin for Asphyxia and Encephalopathy (HEAL)\n\nHEAL is a trial of high-dose erythropoietin vs. placebo in term babies with HIE who are being cooled clinically (33.5C for 72h) to determine if the rates of death or moderate/severe motor or cognitive deficits can be reduced.\n\n<a id='1d306dc1-c5f5-466b-9ac2-e75f4df7bcaa'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

The following documents are located in the binders in the side pocket of the Blanketrol III devices in the NICU: Complete Cooling Document for Referring Hospitals, Hypothermia Algorithm, Blanketrol III Quickstart Guide, Blanketrol III Troubleshooting Tips, and RN to RN Handoff.\n\n<a id='3255b7eb-efc1-49cc-8da5-d399fb8e412e'></a>\n\nVI. THERAPEUTIC HYPOTHERMIA\n\nA. After placement of the esophageal probe the infant is placed on the cooling blanket. Radiographic confirmation of the correct position of the esophageal probe (lower 1/3 of esophagus) must be obtained. See Hypothermia Algorithm and Quickstart Guide located in Blanketrol binder for therapeutic hypothermia induction and maintenance phases of cooling.\n\nB. Core body temperature is continuously monitored and servo-regulated using the esophageal temperature probe.\n\nC. During induction of cooling the entire baby's body (including the head) is placed directly on the cooling mattress until the target temperature (33-34° C or 31.5-32.5° C) is reached.\n\n<a id='485a8951-9806-4670-94f1-0a43a8c59746'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

After the infant reaches target temperature the head should rest on a covered gel pillow and does not come in direct contact with the cooling blanket. Instead the cooling blanket remains in direct contact with the rest of the infant's body, beginning at the shoulders.\n\nE. Core body temperature maintained for 72 hours for clinical hypothermia. If the infant's core temperature drifts out of range (<33°C or > 34 °C) refer to Troubleshooting Sheet in Blanketrol binder.\n\nF. At the conclusion of the cooling period, the patient is rewarmed slowly at a rate of 0.5°C per hour. See Quickstart Guide in Blanketrol Binder for rewarming and post- treatment care.\n\n<a id='ed8af44c-2b29-4452-9ead-e59bacc7f49f'></a>\n\nVII. **PATIENT CARE DURING COOLING**\n\nA. The infant bed is used for monitoring skin temp only. Expect skin temp to be 1-2° cooler than esophageal temperature.\nB. Infant is cared for in the supine position and log-rolled side to side during treatment.\nC. All blood gases are run on a special I-stat, which is calibrated to the core body temperature of 33-34°C. The usual I-stat instrument is calibrated to normal body temperature so it cannot be used. The blood gases during cooling are NOT yet available in EPIC.\nD. Ventilator gases are warmed normally.\nE. Expect lower heart rates. Monitor patient for skin alteration.\nF. Refer to the NICU Hypothermia Order Set in EPIC and the LPCH Intranet \"Nursing Policy and Procedures\" for the details of patient management.\nG. Order continuous video EEG and request a Neurology consult. NICU medical provider must page the on call Neurology resident to request vEEG and to confirm timing of vEEG placement.\n\n<a id='f3c4e90f-1b63-486f-83af-c554fc1c7c89'></a>\n\nVIII. **STANDARDIZING WORKFLOW**\n\nA. Utilize Hypothermia Order Set in EPIC\n\n1. STAT head ultrasound with resistive indices on admission prior to vEEG placement\n\n2. Pre and post ductal saturations monitoring during the first 24 hours of admission\n\n3. vEEG\n\n4. Neurology consult\n\nB. Contact Neurology upon arrival of patient. Confirm start time for vEEG. If vEEG cannot be placed **within 2 hours of admission NICU fellow to initiate aEEG monitoring via placing needle electrodes**. All babies admitted for cooling should be on either aEEG or vEEG within 2 hours of admission to the LPCH NICU.\n\nC. Page Research Coordinator ASAP if eligible for study (i.e. Preemie Cooling, HEAL)\n\nD. Implement Seizure Management Protocol (on intranet) as clinically indicated.\n\nE. Include qualifying information for cooling in H&P. For all outborn infants utilize Transport HIE Worksheet to capture pertinent clinical findings/data related to cooling eligibility or ineligibility (clinical history, biochemical markers, encephalopathy exam).\n\n<a id='52a90448-92e0-4047-8c66-850be5db7ed3'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Utilize Smart phrases where appropriate. \". Sarnat\" in H&P and in event notes for serial exams. \". aEEG\" in daily progress notes.\n\nG. Complete MD/NNP aEEG Review and Interpretation Log at minimum q 3 hours during vEEG monitoring.\n\nH. Document outpatient Neurology follow up plans in Problem List or Discharge Summary.\n\n<a id='98d1d72e-5df0-4ce6-ab7f-1fda25a79244'></a>\n\nIX. **PATIENT CARE DURING AND AFTER REWARMING**\n\nA. Utilize Holding Algorithm to determine if infant is eligible for holding during maintenance phase of cooling.\n\nB. After 72 hours of cooling is complete, infant should be gradually rewarmed over at least 7 hours. Avoid\ntemperatures > 37.0°C.\n\nC. Continuous vEEG should occur during induction phase, maintenance phase, and throughout rewarming\nphase. Ideally, vEEG should continue until 24 hours after rewarmed; however, once the patient has been\nrewarmed vEEG may be discontinued at the discretion of Neurology. Consider asking EEG tech to leave\nCerebral and Parietal electrodes in place when removing vEEG in order to continue neuromonitoring via\naEEG on OBM/Moberg/BRM equipment.\n\nD. All patients undergoing therapeutic hypothermia need to have a brain MRI. Include \"therapeutic hypothermia\nprotocol\" and/or \"HEAL Protocol\" when entering MRI order in EPIC. Optimal timing of MRI depends on goals\nof MRI. If one is seeking the highest sensitivity for timing of injury (i.e. whether it was perinatal), early\nscanning at 24-96 hours makes sense. Later scanning at 7-21 days allows for the highest sensitivity for\nextent of injury (i.e. for prognosis); yet the later the scan the worse the sensitivity is for ascertaining timing of\ninjury. Current practice at LPCH is to perform a single scan at day of life 5 to 7. An MRI at this time gives\nthe best trade off between sensitivity for timing of injury and sensitivity for determining extent of injury for\nprognosis.6\n\n<a id='4c8aca64-34d8-4810-8e01-20fb13f06958'></a>\n\nX. **OUTPATIENT FOLLOW UP**\n\nA. All infants who are cooled should be referred to High Risk Infant Follow (HRIF) Clinic at 4 months age.\n\nB. All infant who are cooled (with and without seizures) should be offered outpatient Neurology follow up. Those with seizures should have follow up 6 weeks after hospital discharge and those without seizures 4-6 months post hospital discharge. Families may choose to decline but it should be offered and documented in the discharge summary.\n\n<a id='7cad12fa-f3d3-4d23-9c01-6e91089c67c6'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Introduction\n\nThe goals of this chapter are: 1) to help you prevent, recognize and distinguish pain from other distressing symptoms; 2) to describe how pain is measured; and 3) to offer options for care that can improve your patient's comfort while in the NICU.\n\n<a id='a0d12698-cafa-4910-808f-8e8ec94c5d7b'></a>\n\nII. **Background**\n\nA. As recently as the late 1970s, it was commonplace to perform surgery on neonates without benefit of anesthesia or analgesia. Although this might sound surprising, there was little known at the time about the pain experiences of neonates, infants, and other non-verbal children. Clinicians thought non-verbal children were incapable of feeling pain, and that they were not able to remember it. Concerns were also frequently raised about the possible adverse effects of pain medications, since they had not yet been evaluated in this population.\n\nB. We now have good evidence for the presence of a predictable stress response to painful interventions in neonates, and can offer treatments to prevent and mitigate this with better knowledge for their potential risks and benefits. The work of Anand et al. (1985) was instrumental in demonstrating that neonates mount a stress response to surgery consisting of detrimental hormonal, metabolic, and cardiovascular effects, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Further studies have shown that this stress response can be reduced by administration of analgesics.\n\nC. In the developing nervous system, nociceptive pathways are present by 24-26 wks, but inhibitory pathways do not develop until the 3rd trimester. Therefore, it is possible that preemie infants feel MORE pain for a given stimulus than older infants, children, and adults. We are now also aware that infants exposed to painful stimuli exhibit exaggerated pain responses to future painful stimuli, making our attention to pain management in the NICU even more important.\n\n<a id='2b611528-4a25-4898-b6fd-1dd1868d4934'></a>\n\n### III. Assessment of Pain\n\nA. Pain is defined as an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience, associated with actual or potential tissue damage or defined in terms of such damage.\n\nB. Pain is a subjective phenomenon. It is REAL regardless of whether tissue damage can be identified or not.\n\nC. Most importantly for infants, the inability to communicate verbally does not negate the possibility than an individual is experiencing pain and is in need of appropriate pain-relieving treatment.\n\n<a id='28112e62-45e4-438e-bb11-b414b1e24b6c'></a>\n\n## IV. Distinguishing Pain From Common Causes of Distress\n\nA. Common causes of non-painful distress are hunger, feeling too cold or hot, needing a diaper changed, being over stimulated by lights and/or sounds, or wanting to be held/wrapped/rocked.\n\nB. Behavior alone is an unreliable predictor of the cause of pain or distress. For example, a baby may be still and outwardly calm, but with tachycardia and limited movement of one lower extremity as the only signs of pain from a broken leg. On the other hand, some neonates scream, arch, and grimace just to let us know their diaper is wet! When assessing a distressed infant consider if pain or other causes of distress could be occurring, and use this to guide your history-taking, physical exam, and studies you obtain.\n\n<a id='e3380767-1284-4a86-a382-25f5c8ebd699'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Schedule for assessments: with every vital sign, 30 min after a pain management intervention (non-pharmacologic or pharmacologic), and other times pain is suspected to be likely to occur (such as during procedures known to be painful or if the patient is fussy.)\n\nB. There are many tools available to systematically characterize the physiologic changes and/or behavioral markers found to be present for infants. In the LPCH NICU/ICN we use the N-PASS (Neonatal Pain, Agitation & Sedation Scale) because of its ease of use, and because validation and reliability data are available.\n\nC. N-PASS scores are located in the chart under IView Critical Care Detailed, so that you can have access to this information when rounding and planning care for a baby.\n\n   1. The N-PASS pain is scored 0 (no pain) up to 10 (severe/highest pain). Note: negative points are assigned when an infant is being sedated.\n\n   2. Nurses will record pain regularly as described in A above, but if you want to score a baby yourself, here's how: Find the value corresponding to the box in each row that best describes a baby's current state, and add the total of all the rows.\n\n   3. Detailed information about the N-PASS tool can be found at http://www.ilemsc.org/PainMgt/NPASS.pdf.\n\nD. Remember that the pain score is only one element of pain assessment. It is just as important to rule out other causes of distress; characterize the timing, frequency, duration, location, provocative/palliative factors, and effect of any prior interventions on the pain. This information directs further evaluation and treatment.\n\nVI. **Pain Management**\n\nManagement options for pain include prevention as well as treatment of the underlying process causing the pain and distress. When it is not possible to immediately cure or prevent an underlying cause of pain, or when we must have an infant undergo a diagnostic or therapeutic intervention that we know will be painful, we utilize multimodal pain therapy as a strategy to prevent or limit the pain experienced. There is evidence that measurable improvements in pain management occur after implementation of practice guidelines directed at improving pain in NICU populations.\n\nVII. **General Guidelines**\n\nMultimodal therapy means using more than one strategy to prevent, treat, or manage pain. Using multiple non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic methods together improve analgesia over a single intervention alone, and may help to limit unwanted side effects by reducing the total dose needed of an individual medication. This is effective whether the pain is mild, moderate or severe.\n\nA. Non-pharmacologic pain management interventions are helpful alone, in conjunction with each other, and when used with medications. Although the effects of these measures are sometimes minimized by health care practitioners who are not at the bedside, dramatic improvements in infant distress are possible from implementing them. Consider the following:\n\n   1. Prevention (do you REALLY need the information you will obtain from a particular test, or might there be a less painful/invasive way to discover that information or answer your clinical question? Can labs be batched, and obtained by indwelling line or venipuncture rather than multiple heel sticks, which are more painful?)\n\n<a id='edccb801-ece5-4c9c-860a-72ded676fc36'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Encouraging parental physical contact/touch\n3. Providing adequate support for staff RNs so that baby has access to calm caregivers at bedside\n4. Decreasing bright lights and loud sounds\n5. Avoiding tactile over-stimulation, or cluster interventions to allow recovery and rest between them\n6. Choosing non-invasive monitoring over invasive monitoring techniques if possible\n7. Allow resting/sleeping periods for baby to establish and maintain circadian rhythm appropriate for age\n8. Limiting pain from tape removal by avoiding placement on hair, and remove gently with moistening/adhesive remover\n9. Lubricating NG/OG and urinary catheters before insertion\n10. Controling thermal stress by providing for comfortable stable ambient temperature\n11. Using skilled/trained personnel to obtain blood and place IV lines\n12. Use mechanical rather than manual lancets for heel sticks\n13. Comfort measures including: swaddling, containment, facilitated tucking, positioning, nesting, rocking, kangaroo care (skin-to-skin), non-nutritive sucking, breastfeeding, massage, music therapy, and age-appropriate special mattresses are very helpful\n14. Consulting pain service to provide acupuncture/acupressure and massage\n\nPharmacologic interventions for pain management include opiates, non-opiate analgesics (acetaminophen, less likely NSAIDS, sucrose), local anesthetics, and systemic anesthetics with analgesic properties. Non-analgesic adjuvants (anxiolytics and sedatives) are often combined with analgesics and non-pharmacologic strategies to lessen stress and improve a patient's overall experience with a painful event. It is important to realize that no ideal pain medication exists that is universally beneficial and without side effects. Therefore, what follows are general suggestions about when to use them, contraindications to use, side effects to watch for, and guidelines for how to choose a dose. See the Housestaff Manual, or other drug resources for additional information. Seek help from others especially if you are unsure.\n\n<a id='fd1b68b3-dcdc-49b5-80e2-b391701737d6'></a>\n\n1. Opiate medications are very effective for treatment and prevention of moderate to severe pain.\n\n   a. They exhibit no ceiling analgesic effect, so may be increased as tolerance develops, to continue to provide analgesia.\n\n   b. Opiates may be administered by single dose or drip depending on length of time analgesia is needed. Consider 1 or 2 single doses (or more) for a procedure, drips or around-the-clock dosing for at least 48 hrs for post-operative pain and for expected, regular and frequent painful interventions such as those that accompany intubation (e.g., need to reposition, suctioning).\n\n   c. The best routes to use in NICU population include PO, NG/OG, and IV. SC and rectal are not as useful due to variable absorption, transdermal patch doses are too strong for this age group except in specific circumstances (when significant opiate tolerance +/- chronic pain are present), and the intramuscular route is never recommended given that this route is painful and absorption is erratic.\n\n   d. Opiate side effects most important to consider in the NICU include decreased Gl motility (may manifest\n\n<a id='b9563a80-d0d2-479a-b8de-8f8e3518c1e0'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Side\neffects often depend on rate of administration, total dose, other meds causing CNS depression, and\npatient factors such as prematurity or underlying instability of CV or CNS due to concurrent illnesses.\n\n<a id='a317c115-0c7c-4810-b8d7-1750242f603d'></a>\n\ne. Prolonged use leads to physical dependence (similar to that occurring with prolonged steroid use), so, to prevent withdrawal, you must always taper the drug slowly (no more than 10-20% per day) when a patient has regularly used an opiate for 5-7 days or longer.\n\nf. Morphine and fentanyl have been the most used and studied in the NICU population. Therefore, reserve use of hydromorphone, methadone or other opiates, for which pharmacodynamic and safety data are limited, to experienced practitioners such as intensivists, anesthesiologist, or following consultation with the pain team.\n\ni. Morphine\n\na) Morphine is a potent analgesic. Chest wall rigidity is less of a risk, and less tolerance develops than with fentanyl. However, morphine is more sedating than fentanyl and recent multi-center trials reveal 2 reasons to use fentanyl over morphine in 23-26 weekers who are already unstable from a CV standpoint: Morphine may worsen hypotension in this group, and morphine's analgesic efficacy, even with good blood levels, may be questionable.\n\nb) Dosing guidelines to initiate therapy in opiate naive patients (usually safest to start low and go up): 0.025-0.1 mg/kg IV bolus, or orally at 3 times the dose (0.075-0.3 mg/kg) every 6 hrs for infants under 3 mos post delivery, q 4 or more often in infants greater than 3 mos post delivery regardless of gestational age. Titrate to effect but watch for side effects. Drips can begin at 0.01-0.03 mg/kg/h depending on level of respiratory depression and sedation (side effects of the drug) you are also intending to achieve with it. Use with extreme caution in patients with renal failure, as sedating and anti-analagesic metabolites may have slow clearance.\n\nc) Future effects, a common parental and staff concern: Former preterm infants who had received morphine in NICU for pain management and were reevaluated at 8-9 years old showed improved executive functioning, and no adverse effects on somatosensory perception, pain thresholds, incidence of chronic pain or neurological functioning relative to infants that received placebo (de Graaf et al., 2013). For an up to date review of the issues see also Anand KJ 2016\n\n<a id='6786611f-ed18-489e-a3db-cb71cdd5130c'></a>\n\nii. Fentanyl\n\na) Fentanyl is a potent analgesic, that has quicker onset (1-2 min), is shorter acting (1-2 hrs), and has less GI slowing, less hemodynamic instability and less urinary retention than morphine. However, there is a greater risk of chest wall rigidity, especially with rapid infusion (give bolus doses slowly!), and much more frequent acute tolerance to the drug than Morphine.\n\nb) It is lipophilic, so it distributes widely and quickly into fatty tissue and extravascular fluid. This can lead to reduced efficacy with single doses, and it can be difficult to clear the drug from extravascular fluid if given by prolonged infusions.\n\n<a id='e1029ef5-17c3-4252-a2cb-2fec000707b5'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Non-opiate Analgesics are helpful for mild to moderate pain, alone or together with opiate medication.\n\n<a id='51fd6465-b68d-4a2c-9f3f-fe188874a5c0'></a>\n\na. Acetaminophen\n\nAcetaminophen has a mild to moderate analgesic effect by multiple central mechanisms (serotonin descending inhibition and opioidergic, eicosanoid, nitrous oxide, endo-cannabinoid systems), and is usually well tolerated when used within dosing guidelines. No tolerance to the drug develops and there is an added analgesic effect when used with opiates.\n\ni. Analgesic ceiling: Doses beyond those recommended lead to more side effects but not better analgesia, concern for irreversible liver failure with overdose, no anti-inflammatory effect.\n\nii. Dose: Pharmacokinetics not established in preemies <28 wks. Usual dose modified in 2011 by recommendation of FDA over hepatotoxicity concerns in adults, now limit dose to 10-15 mg/kg PO/IV, or 20-30 mg/kg PR every 6 hrs. Maximum daily cumulative doses PO/IV of 40 mg/kg/d for 28-32 wks, and 60 mg/kg/d for infants 32-36 wks GA and FT infants <10 days are suggested although risk/benefit for long term use in neonates has not been established. Consider limiting use if patient has sepsis, dehydration or liver dysfunction.\n\niii. A systematic review of the literature (Ohlsson & Shaw, Cochrane 2015) supports efficacy in managing postoperative pain and lowering total opioid requirement, but not for heel lance or, ROP exams.\n\n<a id='a20ca062-5f9d-4f5c-9136-31e5a180646a'></a>\n\nb. NSAIDS (e.g. ibuprofen, ketorolac)\n\ni. NSAIDS are good mild/moderate analgesics especially in preventing inflammatory pain.\n\nUnfortunately, few studies have assessed risks/benefits in infants less than 6 mos of age, thus there is limited utility of this class of medications for analgesia, although multiple trials have described efficacy for PDA closure.\n\nii. Risks include displacement of bilirubin, renal toxicity and/or alteration of clearance of other drugs through kidneys, gastritis/GI bleeding, platelet dysfunction, premature closure of duct if infant has duct dependent cardiac anatomy. Suggest use only on limited basis as directed by experienced practitioners assessing risks and benefits of use for a particular NICU patient.\n\nc. Sucrose\n\nSucrose is an effective short acting (2-3 minute) analgesic for procedural pain. Thought to act by a combination of endogenous opiate and non-opiate mechanisms.\n\ni. Doses of 24% solution found in multiple studies to decrease cry duration, lower heart rate variability, decrease facial expressions indicative of pain, and decrease pain scores in infants less than 6 mos of age.\n\nii. Use along with non-nutritive sucking (i.e., pacifier) \\u00b1 other analgesics for heel stick, venipuncture, art stick, immunization, circumcision, lumbar puncture, eye exam, dressing change, bladder catheterization, pleural tap/chest tube placement.\n\niii. No known side effects, but postulated could cause hyperglycemia or necrotizing enterocolitis. One study suggested that repeated frequent dosing may have contributed to poor neurobehavioral outcomes later in life in <31 week infants. Do not give to infants <27 wks, <1,000 gm, CV instability on pressor support, PPHN, chemically paralyzed patients, or with poor with peripheral perfusion. Consider risk of administering by this route (transmucosal) to infants who are NPO or\n\n<a id='8d82c322-8025-474e-be2c-f3556c488502'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Dose: Tootsweet® brand is 24% solution, single dose based on weight: 2 drops (0.08ml) in <1,000gm; 5 drops (0.2ml) for 1,000-2,500 gm, 10 drops (0.4ml) if >2,500 gm. MAX 3 doses per painful procedure; 4 procedures/24 hours (therefore do not exceed 12 doses/24 hrs). Administer by dipping pacifier or by syringe into anterior portion of mouth for buccal absorption.\n\n<a id='8456d114-4560-408f-bdb9-169197315d82'></a>\n\nd. Local Anesthetics\n\nLocal anesthetics such as lidocaine and bupivacaine/levo-bupivacaine provide local or regional anesthesia by preventing nerve transmission.\n\ni. Used in our NICU in various forms: topically in cream (LMX-4), for subcutaneous injection or into peripheral nerve locations, via epidural route, IV, IO, or via ETT. Topical may be used for circumcision, venipuncture, arterial puncture, lumbar puncture, PICC line placement, but not effective for heel lance. Injectable form is helpful for diagnostic and surgical procedures including chest tube insertion (local or intercostal block), suturing, circumcision (DPNB or ring block), and IV catheter placement. **Do not use the form that contains epinephrine** on areas with end vascular supply such as digits, penis or pinnae as resulting vasoconstriction could lead to necrosis. Use of local anesthetics delivered via regional block or infusion (e.g. via epidural) is limited to experienced practitioners including Anesthesia, Pain Service, Surgery, and intensivists with knowledge of risks/side effects. In capable hands these are usually well tolerated and very effective in reducing localized pain and thus may dramatically reduce requirements for systemic opiate.\n\nii. Dose: LMX-41/4 inch thick to local area intact skin only, SQ/IM lidocaine injection varies, suggested maximum dose in Housestaff Manual 4.5 mg/kg/2 hrs, epidural bupivacaine/levo-bupivacaine infusion of 0.1% not to exceed 3 ml/kg/h.\n\ne. Ketamine\n\nKetamine is a dissociative anesthetic, with sedative, analgesic, and amnestic properties.\n\ni. Risk of deep sedation/anesthesia, hypoxemia, laryngospasm or apnea. Use at Packard is limited to Anesthesiologists and Intensivists and others under approved sedation protocols only. Studies have shown ketamine to be effective for bronchoscopy in infants; however, it has not been demonstrated to be effective for endotracheal suctioning.\n\nf. Alpha-2 Agonist therapy\n\nClonidine and Dexmedetomidine are central alpha-2 agonist with analgesic properties.\n\ni. Limited data exist regarding pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy in infants. This currently limits more widespread use. Both drugs carry risk for hypotension, and must be titrated and weaned. Used primarily as 1) adjuvant during opioid and benzodiazepine weaning for refractory withdrawal, 2) adjuvant to sedate patients with agitation on mechanical ventilation who are refractory to standard management.\n\nNon-analgesic adjuvants\n\nSedatives and anxiolytic medications are often prescribed to induce sleep for diagnostic procedures, calm irritable infants, or along with analgesics to manage pain related agitation. They are also helpful to relieve agitation during mechanical ventilation, and can suppress patients' central respiratory drive in order to achieve synchrony with the ventilator.\n\n<a id='51943cc8-fe26-41df-a943-5ffb547fb6c8'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Remember, sedation is a continuum from mild sedation/anxiolysis, through moderate and deep sedation to anesthesia. One must be prepared to support a patient's airway, respiratory and cardiovascular systems any time these drugs are used. Be especially cautious when you use >1 medication that can cause sedation—the effect is likely to be more profound than predicted. The effect is often synergic, not simply additive!\n\n<a id='66d0b9dc-1557-469d-b91c-eae3a8d20c21'></a>\n\nb. Benzodiazepines\n\n<a id='46292aa6-7af3-4d96-8f5d-8969eed39405'></a>\n\nMidazolam is the benzodiazepine most studied in the NICU population.\n\ni. Risks include sedation (usually desired), respiratory depression, and hypotension. Short-term neurological complications with prolonged infusions have been reported, and concerns have been raised about relationship to frequency of IVH and PVL in ventilated pre-term neonates. Yet, longer acting benzodiazepines such as lorazepam and diazepam have been little studied and have limiting pharmacologic properties that prolong clearance.\n\nii. Tolerance (needing a higher dose to achieve same effect over time) and dependency (withdrawal syndrome if abruptly stopped after 5-7 days regular use) are factors that must be taken into account in selecting dose and eventual weaning schedule.\n\niii. Dose: 0.05-0.15 mg/kg IV, infusions 0.01-0.06 mg/kg/h not uncommon. Oral dose for short radiologic procedures: 0.25 mg/kg PO.\n\n<a id='e78997a4-79b0-4e97-a872-20b2e9dcaa04'></a>\n\nc. Chloral hydrate\n\nChloral hydrate is a non-analgesic hypnotic primarily used for radiologic procedures. Although clinically effective, it is important to realize that it is metabolized into 2 toxic metabolites with half-lives >72 hrs: trichloroethanol competes for glucoronidation and can worsen hyperbilirubinemia; trichloroacetic acid has been shown to be carcinogenic in mice. Because of these concerns, repeated or regular dosing over long periods of time is not recommended.\n\ni. Dose: 25-50 mg/kg PO/PR.\n\n<a id='d1ae735a-636e-4b1b-b4d9-b9aa0455c019'></a>\n\nVIII. Preventing Pain: What to do for Invasive Procedures\n\nFew realize that painful procedures occur with great regularity in the NICU. In one study, critically ill preterm neonates were found to experience 700 painful procedures by the time of discharge, and as many as 7-17painful procedures in a day! Peak exposure occurs during the first few days of admission, and in those receiving respiratory support. Below you will find recommendations and ideas for various procedures.\n\n<a id='dfd82fbf-a78e-4d87-bf61-949d4be5aaf1'></a>\n\nA. Consider sucrose and non-nutritive sucking, swaddling, containment, facilitated tucking plus:\n\n1. Heel lance: venipuncture instead, skin to skin, mechanical lancet\n2. Venipuncture: LMX-4 to site\n3. Arterial puncture: LMX-4 to site, SubQ lidocaine locally\n4. Injections: choose IV over IM whenever possible\n5. Umbilical catheter: avoid sutures or hemostat clamps on the skin around the umbilicus\n6. Central line: LMX-4 to the site, SubQ lidocaine, opioid analgesic\n\n<a id='1e839025-ba07-4ea2-a590-6fca3557bccc'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Endotracheal suctioning: consider opioid analgesic\n\n8. Nasogastric tube placement: gentle technique, lubrication to tube\n\n9. For the following procedures, consider sucrose and pacifier with addition of options below:\n\n   a. Lumbar puncture: LMX-4 at site, subQ lidocaine\n\n   b. Chest tube: subQ lidocaine, opioid analgesic, or short acting anesthetic\n\n   c. Circumcision: LMX-4 locally, dorsal penile nerve block or ring block with lidocaine, Mogen over Gomco, acetaminophen post-procedure\n\n   d. Eye examination: local anesthetic eye drops\n\n   e. Post-operative pain: do not use sucrose. At least 48 hrs of around-the-clock analgesic such as opiate ± acetaminophen depending on bowel function/NPO status. Non-pharmacologic strategies as appropriate.\n\n<a id='ef60448b-fd95-48ba-bd3f-2e5f81afc153'></a>\n\nIX. **For Further Information**\n\nA.

Davis, MD, MS Epi and Valerie Y. Chock, MD, MS Epi\n\n## I. Amplitude Integrated EEG (aEEG)\n\n### A. What is aEEG?\n\naEEG is a simplified, bedside EEG device used to continuously monitor brain function. Brain wave activity is recorded from scalp electrodes and the raw EEG data is processed using a filter to attenuate frequencies <2Hz and >15Hz, amplitudes are transformed into a rectified and time-compressed signal and displayed on a semi-logarithmic scale in microVolts (µV). Interpretation of the aEEG recording includes assessment of the minimum amplitude, maximum amplitude, bandwidth, and the presence of sleep-wake cycles (SWC). This results in patterns that are easily recognizable without formal training in EEG analysis.\n\n### B. Indications for aEEG monitoring\n\n1. Confirmation of suspected clinical seizures, especially when formal continuous EEG is not available\n2. Assessment for subclinical seizures in high risk infants (e.g. preterm with severe IVH)\n3. Continuous monitoring of therapeutic effects of anti-epileptic medication\n4. Prediction of outcomes in hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE)\n5. Other potential, but not well-studied, uses for aEEG include: metabolic encephalopathy, patients on ECMO, assessment of neuromaturation in preterm infants, assessment of post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus, surgical anesthesia and post-operative recovery\n\n<a id='390c2155-08a4-442d-9dfa-d122e0c33b1a'></a>\n\nC. Placement of aEEG\n\n1.  Types of electrodes\n    a.  Hydrogel: most commercial aEEG devices utilize these disposable electrodes which are similar to regular EKG electrodes\n    b.  Cup-disk or spider: reusable; requires EEG conductive paste (Ten20 paste)\n    c.  Needle: minimal skin preparation required and achieves low impedances; invasive, with theoretical risk for infection\n\n2.  Recording montages: Location of electrodes based on the 10-20 international classification system modified for neonates (Figure 1)\n    a.  Single channel: traditionally, electrodes are positioned at P3 and P4, which is the area overlying the cortical watershed zone in infants with HIE.\n    b.  Three channel: electrodes positioned at C3, P3, C4, P4 create two bi-parietal channels (C3-P3, C4-P4) and a cross-cerebral channel (P3-P4). This is most commonly used at LPCH.\n    c.  All devices require an additional ground electrode, usually placed on the upper back (preferred) or forehead. Some devices may additionally require a reference electrode on the scalp (typically Cz)\n    d.  Other EEG recording systems may utilize additional channels\n\n<a id='00061020-5e88-4307-ba3e-63b2f593d728'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Three channel aEEG utilizes electrodes at C3, C4, P3, and P4 to create a right-sided channel (C4-P4), a left-sided channel (C3-P3) and a cross-cerebral channel (P3-P4).\n\n<a id='ae0022bc-1a24-4205-ad27-93a838457a8c'></a>\n\n<::The image is a diagram illustrating the 10-20 system for EEG electrode placement on a human head, viewed from above. \n\n**Anatomical Landmarks:**\n- Nasion (at the top, front of the head)\n- Inion (at the bottom, back of the head)\n- Preauricular Point (on both left and right sides, near the ears)\n\n**Electrode Positions:**\n- Fp1, Fp2\n- F7, F3, Fz, F4, F8\n- T3, C3, Cz, C4, T4\n- T5, P3, Pz, P4, T6\n- O1, O2\n\n**Lines and Regions:**\n- A solid vertical line runs from Nasion through Fz, Cz, Pz, to Inion.\n- A solid horizontal line runs between the Preauricular Points, passing through T3, C3, Cz, C4, T4.\n- Dashed lines connect other electrode points, forming a grid.\n- Numbered regions are indicated: 1 (central), 2 (left central), 3 (left frontal-polar), 4a (left frontal-central), 4b (right frontal-central), 5 (right frontal-polar), 6 (parietal-occipital).\n: diagram::>\n\n<a id='ca0ffb26-b021-4ff5-90e7-0d8290cd9ab6'></a>\n\n3. Skin preparation: when cup-disk or hydrogel electrodes are used, skin should be cleaned and exfoliated prior to application.

Data quality: Impedance is continuously measured during the aEEG recording. Impedances greater than 10kΩ indicate poor electrode contact, insufficient skin preparation, or electrical interference, and the electrodes should be checked. Ideally, impedances are below 5 KΩ prior to starting the recording\n\n<a id='b31d2ba9-51df-4fbe-a997-fac0f07863c7'></a>\n\n5. Available aEEG equipment:\n\na.

Low Voltage: continuous background with both minimum and maximum amplitudes less than 10μ V\n\ne. Isoelectric/flat: primarily isoelectric tracing with amplitudes less than 5µ V\n\nf. Recovery of a normal background pattern (either continuous or discontinuous) within 36-48 hours has been associated with a good outcome in term HIE.\n\ng. Recovery of background pattern and SWCs may be delayed for infants treated with hypothermia.\n\nh. Preterm infants: In healthy preterm infants, the aEEG matures from a discontinuous pattern to a continuous pattern with advancing gestational and postmenstrual age. In other words, the minimum amplitude increases, the bandwidth and maximum amplitude decrease, and there is interval development of mature sleep-wake cycles. Isoelectric and low voltage patterns have been associated with the development of intraventricular hemorrhage.\n\n<a id='807dedcc-a992-4595-880f-f4dcf079c16c'></a>\n\n2. Seizures\n   a. On the compressed aEEG tracing an isolated seizure is reflected by an increase in the minimum amplitude; repetitive seizures appear as a \"saw tooth\" pattern (see Figure 2)\n   b. It is important to confirm seizure activity on the raw EEG tracing (see Limitations)\n\n<a id='95c7a1a1-0200-4707-89d5-ab8231fa3925'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Sleep-Wake Cycling\n\na. Immature SWCs may begin to appear as early as 25 to 27 weeks' gestational age as evidenced by sinusoidal fluctuations in the minimum amplitude.\n\nb. More mature SWCs in healthy infants appear between 30 and 34 weeks' gestational age but are often shorter in duration compared to mature SWCs, which emerge at 36-37 weeks' gestational age\n\nc. In healthy preterm infants, SWCs may appear at earlier postmenstrual ages than would be expected of\n\n<a id='06d12a0f-4fc1-4408-a700-b59aff0b4bfe'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Shorter time to recovery of SWCs is associated with improved outcome in term HIE, while lack of SWC recovery predicts poor outcome.\n\nE. Limitations of aEEG monitoring\n\n1. Due to nature of the time-compressed recording, brief seizures (<30 seconds) may be missed\n2. As only one to three channels are recorded, seizures or abnormal background activity in the frontal or occipital regions will not be detected\n3. Artifacts\n   a. Mimics of seizures include any repetitive movement such as burping, patting, swinging\n   b. High frequency ventilation, external electrical interference, EKG, and muscle movement can falsely elevate amplitudes\n   c. Contact between electrodes (either by physical contact or by a bridge created by paste/moisture) can result in falsely low amplitudes\n   d. Sedative medications may depress the background pattern and/or suppress SWCs\n\n<a id='137a6e0a-3265-4c03-892b-a51edd56b668'></a>\n\nII. **Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS)**\n\nA. **What is NIRS?**\n\nNIRS is a non-invasive technique to continuously monitor regional tissue oxygenation. It has most commonly been used for cerebral oximetry, although monitoring of renal and mesenteric oxygenation are other potential applications. A skin sensor transmits near-infrared light, which penetrates underlying tissues to a depth of 2.5 to 3 cm. Light is differentially absorbed by oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin from the tissue vasculature, and remaining light is then detected by the sensor. A regional tissue oxygen saturation (rSO2) is then calculated based on a weighted average of 20% arterial blood, 75% venous blood, and 5% capillary blood in the underlying tissue. The rSO2 value reflects a regional balance between tissue oxygen supply and demand.\n\nB. **Indications for 2-site NIRS monitoring (and admission to NeuroNICU)**\n\n1. Conditions with altered hemodynamic states causing cerebral hypoxemia\n   a. Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy\n   b. Congenital heart disease- especially with decreased systemic outflow for peri-operative monitoring\n   c. Prematurity with altered cerebral autoregulation. All preterm infants <29 weeks gestation undergo NIRS monitoring for the first week of life.\n   d. Hypoxic respiratory failure or pre-ECMO\n\n2. Conditions with altered hemodynamics affecting mesenteric or renal oxygenation\n   a. Shock- Drop in somatic oxygenation may be an early potential indicator of low cardiac output before other indicators like blood pressure, acidosis, and decreased urine output\n\n<a id='358d9ba8-6710-4465-bb9c-8781f69ec354'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Over the last several decades, survival rates have improved across many diagnostic groups admitted to the NICU, however the rates of neurologic and neurodevelopmental impairment are increasing with life-long effects on survivors and their families. The Neuro NICU was developed to improve the care of newborns with brain injury or at risk for brain injury. Another stimulus was the expertise developed over the last decade at LPCH in the areas of therapeutic hypothermia, aEEG, NIRS, neuroradiology, prenatal diagnosis, and high-risk infant follow-up.\n\n<a id='a6b6a3fb-00f0-48ad-a695-dd3c54aa572d'></a>\n\nA.

If the Neurology team is not actively following the patient a time of hospital discharge please contact Neurology regarding timing of outpatient follow up. If they do not wish to follow any of these patients then initiate an outpatient referral to our Neonatal Neurologist, Dr. Courtney Wusthoff.\n\n<a id='67e90316-cffd-4972-93e5-71e323050c5a'></a>\n\n**Neuro NICU Database:** With the goal of further improving care for this vulnerable population, we are keeping a database of infants admitted to the Neuro NICU and those who have received neuro- monitoring. Since April 2013 we have collected data on over 1400 infants. We anticipate this database will be both a clinical and research resource in the years to come. If you are interested in assisting with a research project or have suggestions please contact us.\n\n<a id='bdae3e8b-96fd-49b9-b923-bafe104482e6'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.
