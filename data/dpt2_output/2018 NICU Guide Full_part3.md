I. Introduction

A. Goals for the premature infant

1. Simulate intrauterine growth
   a. Weight gain: 1-2% of body weight/day
   b. OFC increase by 0.5-1.0 cm/wk
   c. Length increase by 1-1.5 cm/wk

2. Stimulate fetal intestinal function: The fetal gut absorbs 500 mL of amniotic fluid/day near term which has a direct trophic effect on its development and integrity.

3. Avoid complications of TPN

B. When to start enteral feeding?

As soon as there are no contraindications, such as:

1. Hemodynamic instability
   a. Need for volume resuscitation
   b. Dopamine >5 mcg/kg/min
   c. Initiation of hydrocortisone (can feed if stable on maintenance or weaning doses)
   d. Significant PDA or ≤48 hrs after closure with indomethacin

2. Abnormal abdomen
   a. Abdominal distention, discoloration, "surgical" abdomen
   b. Suspected GI anomaly
   c. Large volume or bloody gastric residual.
   d. After GI Surgery - per discussion with Surgical Team.

3. Perinatal depression (e.g., low Apgars, metabolic acidosis, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, Therapeutic Hypothermia) requires individualized clinical evaluation

4. Respiratory instability
   a. Impending ECMO

b. Prolonged episodes of hypoxemia/desaturation.
c. Mechanical ventilation and/or UAC are not in and of themselves contraindications to enteral feeding.

<a id='bf0149f9-4ada-43b4-84dc-6b5f3dd59b35'></a>

II. **What to Feed**

A. Maternal milk (MM): Every effort should be made before and after delivery to encourage maternal pumping (unless there is a documented medical contraindication).

1. The volume of expressed milk at 2 wks post-partum is usually predictive of successful lactation; this should be ≥500 mL/day.
2. Lactation Services are available to consult and assist our mothers. Early intervention is best.
3. It is not necessary however to delay enteral nutrition until maternal milk supply is available.

B. Donor milk (DM)

1. For VLBW infants at risk for NEC, Human Donor Milk (DM) from the Milk Bank is available to supplement the maternal supply. Bigger, older babies might be suitable candidates, but should be discussed with the nutritionist. Milk donors are screened like blood donors, but additionally may not smoke nor be on medications. DM is also Holder Pasteurized, which destroys bacteria and known viruses, such as CMV and HIV.
2. Pasteurization does kill the white cells in DM, and thus, it is not as good as fresh MM. However, many bioactive properties remain. Both sources of human milk are superior to formula in preventing NEC and nosocomial infections, and in enhancing immunity.
3. DM is available in small-volume containers for use in trophic feeds in even the smallest infants, so concern for DM wastage should not delay the start of enteral feedings.

C. Advantages of human milk

1. Presence of numerous hormones and growth factors, including epidermal growth factor; as well as bioactive properties including Human Milk Oligosaccharides, Lactoferrin, Immunoglobulins, and Lysozyme.

<a id='393e6204-250e-425c-9272-9772e88aba2e'></a>

D. Limitations of human milk

1. Additional protein, sodium, Vitamin D, calcium, and phosphorus may be necessary to meet premature infants' needs.
2. Human milk has a range of caloric content and it is occasionally inadequate to support adequate weight gain by itself. Of note, DM from the Milk Bank is pooled so that the caloric content is fairly constant, and no recipient is at risk of getting low-calorie milk from an "outlier" donor
3. Maternal milk can be a source of bacterial infection if not collected carefully. MM may transmit viruses such as CMV even after freezing. Currently, the most common cause of CMV infection in the NICU is maternal milk.

Human Milk Fortifiers (HMF) or formula can be added to breast milk to increase caloric density, protein, and electrolyte content. Due to concerns regarding sterility, powdered fortifiers and powdered formulas are only used when a reasonable liquid alternative is not available.

<a id='e9a83035-d175-485c-abd7-209b130cbcb7'></a>

1. **Human-Milk Based Human Milk Fortifier (H2MF)** from Prolacta is used for infants less than 1250 grams at birth until they are 34 weeks PMA. H2MF is automatically added into the enteral feeding pathways (see Tables 1-3 below) for infants ≤ 1250 grams at birth at 60 mL/kg/day of enteral volume.

a. Prolact+4 (10 mL fortifier added to 40 mL human milk) adds 4 kcal/oz to human milk ≈ 24 kcal/oz
b. Prolact+6 (30 mL fortifier added to 70 mL human milk) ≈ 26 kcal/oz
c. Prolact+8 (40 mL fortifier added to 60 mL human milk) ≈ 28 kcal/oz
d. Prolact+10 (50 mL fortifier added to 50 mL human milk) ≈ 30 kcal/oz
e. See Figure 1 for guidelines for transitioning off of Prolacta products at ~34 weeks PMA

2. **Similac® Human Milk Fortifier Hydrolyzed Protein Concentrated Liquid (Liquid HMF)** is a cow's milk based product for premature and low-birth-weight infants to add to breastmilk. The hydrolyzed protein in this product is similar to that in Alimentum®. It can be used for infants ≥ 1251 grams at birth to add to human milk when volume of feeds is 60 mL/kg/day, or it can be used when it is time for a baby to transition off of Prolacta.

a. 1 packet added to 50 mL of Human Milk ≈ 22 kcal/oz
b. 1 packet added to 25 mL of Human Milk ≈ 24 kcal/oz

3. **Liquid Protein Fortifier–** Abbott Liquid Protein Fortifier® (ALPF) is an extensively hydrolyzed protein liquid that can be added to MM/DM. The protein in ALPF is similar to that in Alimentum® and thus should be less allergenic. The concentration is 1 g per 6 mL, thus adding 1 mL to 25 mL of feeds would give an additional 1 g/kg daily of protein to an infant taking 150 mL/kg daily. It does not add any vitamins or minerals.

4. **Liquid Formula–** There are concerns about sterility with powdered formulas, so liquid concentrates are used to fortify human milk if needed. Liquid formulas may also be easier for mixing (i.e. they do not clump like powders). Mixing human milk with liquid formula decreases the amount of human milk consumed, and can be used to extend supplies if maternal production is limited. Similac Special Care 30® (SSC30) is designed for premature infants for this purpose. This provides additional calcium and phosphorus, as well as protein and calories. Term formula concentrates are also available for concentrating human milk.

a. Similac Special Care 30® (SSC30)

i. Human Milk: SSC30 mixed 2:1 ≈ 23 kcal/oz
ii. Human Milk: SSC30 mixed 1:1 ≈ 25 kcal/oz
iii. Human Milk: SSC30 mixed 1:2 ≈ 27 kcal/oz

b. Term Formula Concentrate (typically 40 cal/oz)

96 Part II-A: Fluids and Nutrition

i. Human Milk: Term Formula Concentrate mixed 9:1 ≈ 22 kcal/oz
ii. Human Milk: Term Formula Concentrate mixed 4:1 ≈ 24 kcal/oz
iii. Human Milk: Term Formula Concentrate mixed 2.3:1 ≈ 26 kcal/oz
iv. Human Milk: Term Formula Concentrate mixed 1.5:1 ≈ 28 kcal/oz
v. Human Milk: Term Formula Concentrate mixed 1:1 ≈ 30 kcal/oz

<a id='a53b77cb-2fab-4019-b891-c3ee1dec3f38'></a>

5. **Fat** – very concentrated caloric source, though not optimum nutrition and large doses can cause loose stools.
    a. MCT oil (medium-chain triglycerides) – 7.6 kcal/mL readily absorbed; useful in steatorrhea.
    b. MicroLipid – 4.5 kcal/mL includes essential long-chain fatty acids

<a id='b7493b75-0557-49b7-94ae-39f49de945d4'></a>

6. Formula Powder, e.g., NeoSure®, Enfamil®, EnfaCare®, Similac®, Pregestimil®, Nutramigen®,
Alimentum®: These are generally used as a home regimen and only in the last few days before
discharge. Note that the calcium in powders may not be very bioavailable. Liquid concentrate is
preferable, but is not available for every formula or from stores for home use, so if an infant needs
fortified human milk feedings at home, powdered formulas may need to be used.

<a id='0563a765-361d-4a9c-9524-6c17d80b60bd'></a>

F. **Formula feedings**

On (hopefully) rare occasions, mothers may not provide their own milk and refuse donor milk. In this situation, premature infants should be started on a 20 kcal/oz premature formula (e.g., Premature Enfamil® or PE®; Similac Special Care® or SSC®). There is no need to dilute these formulas. Once full-feeds are tolerated, these can be advanced to the 24 kcal/oz version. For infants with increased protein needs or low serum albumin, there are "High Protein" formulations of both SSC and PE 24 cal/oz, which provide 10-12% more protein at the same osmolality and caloric density. (See "Formula - Description and Selection").

<a id='fd66901e-9f62-4108-9ab8-0b53d601a5ba'></a>

## G. Osmolality Guidelines

1.  AAP suggests that formulas for normal infants not exceed 400mOsm/L (450mOsm/kg); guidelines do not exist for premature infant formulas.
    a.  Osmolality of most feeds, including formula are <370 mOsm/kg, except for when Similac Liquid HMF is added to human milk
    b.  Human Milk +Similac Hydrolyzed Protein Liquid HMF (24 cal/oz) = 450 mOsm/kg
    c.  Do NOT fortify MM/DM with the LHMF beyond 24 cal/oz
    d.  IF you think the patient needs more kcals, STOP the HMF and fortify MM with Similac Special Care 30 in a 1:1 ratio for ~ 25 kcal/oz, and advance if tolerated to 1:2 ratio, for ~27 cal/oz

<a id='b41332ba-3556-4813-9374-5de8ef6f699e'></a>

III. **Fluid Volume**

A. Our main goals for enteral feeds are to provide calories for growth and to meet all the other nutritional needs of the patients.

1. If your goal calories are 100-120 kcal/kg/day. This will require 150 mL/kg/day of 24-calorie/oz formula/fortified human milk as the feeding target for most premature infants, although many without heart or lung problems will tolerate 175-180 mL/kg/day or more.
2. Premature infants with chronic lung disease or heart disease may require 120-150 kcal/kg/day with decreased tolerance for fluid, dictating > 24-calorie/oz feedings and/or additional nutrient supplements.

<a id='2dcdeae6-a158-4ce9-9b79-88a4193eb5a9'></a>

IV. **Feeding Guidelines for Preterm Infants**

A. Route

1. Asymptomatic infants who can suck/swallow (usually ≥33 wks EGA) may attempt nipple feeds.
2. Most premature infants <34 EGA weeks are fed via gavage tube, either nasogastric (NG) or orogastric (OG).
3. Premature infants who don't tolerate gastric feeding due to poor gastric emptying or small preemies <1 kg who require nasal CPAP can be managed with transpyloric nasojejunal (NJ) feeding. With small infants on CPAP, swallowed air can collect in the stomach leading to distention and feeding intolerance. By feeding transpylorically and using a standard orogastric (OG) tube left open to air for venting, gastric distention is minimized and feeding can be accomplished safely.
   a. NJ tubes require an x-ray to verify placement.
   b. Transpyloric feeds must be by "continuous drip" using a pump.
   c. Enteral medications should be checked to verify that they can be given via transpyloric route.
   d. Note that any form of drip feeding will result in loss of calories due from nutrients sticking to the tubing, and thus should be avoided unless necessary.

<a id='532ad6a7-88bb-49f8-a813-0d59debea391'></a>

B. Trophic feeds

Early enteral nutrition has been demonstrated to have a beneficial effect on maturation of the intestinal tract of the VLBW infant, improved feeding tolerance, decrease TPN days, improve growth, and improve bone mineralization. The prolonged withholding of enteral feeds delays the capability of the intestines to adapt to the extra-uterine environment and may actually enhance the potential of pathogenic organisms to translocate across the intestine causing generalized infection. Small volume trophic feeds can be given with a UAC in place.

<a id='d99733d5-6f55-49c5-9a70-04260897966f'></a>

## C. Colostrum

Colostrum, the initial milk produced in the first several days of lactation, has very important immunologic and trophic effects. Even if the volume is small, it provides great benefit to premature infants, and every effort should be made to collect and utilize it.

1.  If the infant is ready to begin feeds, colostrum should be used according to the appropriate feeding pathway described below.
2.  If feeds are still contraindicated, colostrum should be delivered to the buccal pouch (i.e. inside the cheek) in small volumes (≤1 mL each side) via syringe or cotton swab until the patient is ready to

  begin the appropriate enteral feeding pathway.

<a id='1479cef6-afcf-401d-bbcc-6667fd635cd2'></a>

D. Feeding pathways

1.  See the pathways below for details of feeding babies with birth weights ≤1000 g, 1001–1250 g, or 1251–1500 g (Table 1, 2, & 3).
2.  Feedings should be rounded to nearest mL (i.e., 2 mL not 2.2 mL).
3.  The goal is to initiate feedings **on the first day** of life, using donor milk until maternal milk is available if necessary, for VLBW infants.
4.  For infants ≤14 days old, use birth weight until the baby regains above this. Thereafter, you may need to individualize for small weight changes at the pathway advances.

<a id='88e52045-b48e-4c6a-abeb-f8d40253b3d2'></a>

E. Monitoring

Tolerance to feeds must be monitored continuously. Infants should be clinically evaluated/examined and a decision made whether to continue, reduce or hold feedings, for the following:

1. Abdominal distention, visible loops or abdominal discoloration
2. Worsening clinical status, e.g.:
   a. Hemodynamic/respiratory instability
   b. Hypo- or hyperglycemia
3. Bloody stools NOT related to anal fissure
4. Bloody gastric residual or emesis

F. Constipation

Premature infants may go more than 24 hrs without a stool, but constipation may result in feeding intolerance. An order for occasional glycerin suppository may help stimulate stooling if none has occurred in 24-48 hours.

G. Vitamins, Iron, and Minerals

See Vitamin and Mineral Chapter

H. Nutrition laboratory studies

We check labs periodically on "feeding and growing" premature infants for signs of vitamin/mineral, iron, and protein deficiency, depending upon their clinical situation.

1. Hematocrit q week; if low (<30%) and decreasing, then add reticulocyte count.
2. For patients on chronic diuretics:
   a. Renal Function Panel x 1-2/wk to follow electrolytes, Ca, & P.

b. Watch for hypochloremia, an indication of intracellular K-depletion; correct with KCI.
c. Consider Alkaline Phosphatase q 1-2 wks to watch for metabolic bone disease.

3. Once off of PN, TPN labs can be discontinued if they have been benign. Labs that may need to be followed if there are any concerns include:

a. BUN: assesses protein utilization and renal function. A high BUN in the presence of normal renal function implies protein overload. Conversely, one can "push" protein intake as long as the BUN stays low (i.e., ≤ 20).

b. Ca/Phos: assesses dietary intake & Ca:P ratio. Severe rickets can develop in the presence of a normal serum Ca, as Ca is mobilized from bone to preserve this. Inadequate P intake, reflected by a serum P ≤ 4, is more commonly seen. High serum P is common with Prolact fortifier (~ 18% of time) and is usually benign unless serum P > serum Ca.

c. Alkaline phosphatase (AlkP): normally increased with bone formation in premature infants, but if significantly elevated (>800 IU) it may be due to sub-optimal calcium/phosphorous or vitamin D intake. AlkP can also be elevated in patients with hepatocellular damage and/or cholestasis, and it may be difficult to ascertain which factor is causing the elevation. Furthermore, AlkP increases during bone healing with resolving nutritional rickets. Radiograph of the bones may be helpful. Densitometry is not recommended.

d. Albumin: assesses protein intake/anabolism. Usually a low ALB and low BUN indicates inadequate Protein intake. Rarely, a low ALB indicates markedly decreased liver synthetic function.

<a id='99424592-95ab-4be5-953d-878c5cf8714c'></a>

I. Growth monitoring

1. Weight is measured daily, unless it is unsafe
   a. Goal Weight Gain
2. Re-gain Birthweight by Day of Life 14
3. Premature Goals: 18 g/kg/day for optimal neurodevelopmental outcomes
4. Term Goals: 25+ g/day
5. Length and Head Circumference are measured weekly
   a. Length Growth Goals >0.9 cm/week
   b. Head Circumference Goals: >0.9 cm/week

<a id='539ce7f7-5659-4b7f-b9a2-d48d919be8ba'></a>

V. **Post-discharge diet**

Though many NICU Grads will grow well and meet their nutritional needs on unfortified maternal milk, some will need ongoing nutritional support. Many of the formulas and fortifiers used in the NICU are not readily available for home use, so we use "post-discharge formulas" (PDF) for this purpose. Since having mom pump, freeze, defrost, and then measure and add powders to her milk is not as conducive to prolonged breast feeding, we prefer to have the mom breast feed and supplement with occasional bottles of PDF. Furthermore, this method is better nutritionally (see Figure 2).

VI. **Pediatric Surgery Feeding Algorithm for NICU Patients**

A. **Post op**: Assess when to initiate enteral feeding based on surgical repair

B. **Criteria for starting pathway**:

1.  Adjusted gestational age/PMA ≥ 34+0/7 weeks
2.  Hemodynamically stable
3.  Evidence of return of bowel function as documented by stool and/or clearing of color or decrease in OGT output
4.  No evidence of GI obstruction (no abdominal distension, emesis)
5.  NICU and Surgery agree on starting pathway and any deviation is discussed during rounds

C. **Guidelines for which pathway to start based on surgical repair (ultimate decision is at the discretion of Surgical and NICU teams)**:

1.  **Pathway A - Slow**: aspiration on barium swallow, documented aspiration pneumonia, ENT issue, duodenal/jejunal/ileal atresia repair, high stoma
2.  **Pathway B - Medium**: CDH, omphalocele/gastroschisis, volvulus
3.  **Pathway C - Fast**: no vocal cord issues, low risk repair (LADD's procedure, pyloric stenosis after 4 hours), esophageal atresia after normal barium swallow, Hirschprung's, anorectal malformation repair, colostomy, s/p stoma takedown
4.  **For G- tube placement**: Wait 24 hours, then start half of previously tolerated gastric feeding regimen and advance to goal over 24 hours. If never fed previously, then start Pathway C.

Vitamin and Mineral Requirements for the Enterally Fed Newborn 105

**Vitamin and Mineral Requirements for Enterally Fed Newborns**

<a id='fa54aa09-7547-4097-927d-8fa3ab76b8f0'></a>

Olivia Mayer RD, CSP, IBCLC

I. Vitamin Requirements

A. Vitamin A

As of 2/26/2015, the LPCH pharmacy does not routinely carry Vitamin A due to limited availability and cost

B. Vitamin E

5-25 IU/kg/d. Minimum needs are met by fortified human milk or preterm formula; Poly-vi-sol® (1 mL/d) will supply another 5 IU. Additional supplementation is not required, unless there is evidence of deficiency.

C. Vitamin D

1. 400-600 IU/kg/d; met by pre-term formula or fortified human milk in combination with Poly-vi-sol® (1 mL/d) or D-vi-sol® (1 mL/day).

   a. Not always met by full formula feeds, as Vitamin D content varies widely between formulations

2. If found to be Vitamin D deficient, need at least 1000 IU Vitamin D/day.

<a id='56a991de-d495-48ab-a42f-c87bb95e18ff'></a>

D. Other Vitamins

Fortified human milk or pre-term formula, in combination with multivitamins, is an important dietary adjunct for very low birth weight infants. Once the infant is on full enteral feeds, a multivitamin preparation such as Poly-Vi-Sol® should be started. For infants weighing <1500 gm, the dose is 0.5 mL PO/NG, every 12 hours. For infants >1500 gm, the dose is 1 mL PO/NG daily. Although the formulas for preterm infants contain supplemental vitamins as do the human milk fortifiers, the premature infant may benefit from additional supplementation using multivitamin preparations. If, however, the infant's serum phosphorus level is found to be increasing (>8 mg/dL) the vitamins may need to be decreased or discontinued. One should first be sure that the elevation is not due to a low Ca:PO4 ratio in the diet or renal abnormalities. AquADEKS™ is used instead of Poly-Vi-Sol® for infants with renal or liver abnormalities.

Arlene Sheehan, N.N.P.-B.C

I. **Definition**

A. Central K+ >6.5mEq/L
B. Serum K+ > 7mEq/L, or hyperkalemia with EKG changes should be considered an emergency.

<a id='88924696-83aa-4e25-ae9a-62aa027701be'></a>

## II. Considerations

A. About 98% of total body potassium is intracellular, mostly in skeletal muscle.

B. About 90% of potassium excretion from the body occurs in the urine, with approximately 10% in stool.

   1. **Hyperkalemia usually occurs when renal excretion is impaired**
   2. Premature infants have impaired renal excretion of potassium.

C. Potassium shifts readily between the intracellular and extracellular spaces. Movement of potassium is affected by changes in pH, hormones (aldosterone) and some medications.

   1. Medications that can increase serum K: digitalis, indomethacin, spironolactone, heparin, beta blockers
   2. Medications that can decrease serum K: loop diuretics (Lasix®), insulin, caffeine, theophylline, thiazide diuretics mineralocorticoids, beta adrenergics

<a id='6312c768-d953-4d56-80e5-c898771b9dde'></a>

III. **Etiology**

A. Laboratory error or hemolyzed specimen caused by phlebotomy (most common).

B. Impaired renal excretion
   1. Acute renal failure
   2. Low GFR in the VLBW infant

C. Acidosis (metabolic or respiratory) causing potassium shift from intracellular to extracellular space.

D. Tissue death with release of intracellular potassium.

E. Exchange transfusion with old banked blood or massive transfusion.

F. Excessive administration of K+

G. Pathologic hemolysis of red blood cells
   1. Intraventricular hemorrhage.
   2. Use of hypotonic glucose solution (i.e., <3% Dextrose).

3. Pseudomonas sepsis.

4. Rh incompatibility.

H. Decreased activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system

   1. Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (patients also present with ambiguous genitalia (females), hyponatremia and acidosis).

   2. Adrenal hemorrhage.

   3. Adrenal insufficiency.

I. Pseudohypoaldosteronism type I (PHA-1) caused by renal resistance to aldosterone - patients present with severe dehydration caused by renal salt wasting, hyponatremia, hyperkalemis, acidosis and sometimes failure to thrive. Suspect in patients who do not respond to mineralocorticoid or glucocorticoid treatment.

J. Digoxin therapy.

K. Severe leukocytosis or thrombocytosis

IV. Treatment
A. Repeat STAT measurement by central route. Avoid drawing blood proximal to an intravenous site that contains potassium.
B. Stop administration of potassium in intravenous fluids and any medications containing potassium.
C. EKG: Do a Lead II strip to check for peaked (tall or tented) T-waves, wide flat P waves, widening QRS complex, S-T depression, and/or prolonged PR interval. May see bradycardic arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest.
   1. If EKG changes are present give calcium chloride 20 mg/kg IV to decrease myocardial excitability. May repeat in 10 minutes if necessary.
D. Stop all (gentamicin, vancomycin, etc.) renally toxic meds
E. Determine whether cause is impaired elimination or excess administration: calculate the Fractional Excretion of Potassium (FEK).
   1. Link: http://www.scymed.com/en/smnxps/pshfb358.htm
   2. Excess administration- FEK high
   3. Impaired elimination- FEK low
F. Correct hypovolemia- normal saline bolus to increase renal perfusion and potassium excretion (if no renal failure).
G. Furosemide (Lasix®) 1 mg/kg/dose- if renal function is adequate to promote renal excretion of potassium
H. Correct respiratory acidosis with adequate ventilation
I. Correct metabolic acidosis with bicarbonate 1 mEq/kg over 30 min (moves potassium into the cell).
   1. Avoid bicarbonate in the VLBW infant.
   2. Correct respiratory acidosis first before giving bicarbonate.
J. Glucose and insulin may be given to drive potassium intracellularly.
   1. If infant is normoglycemic give bolus of insulin and glucose together: 0.05 units/kg of regular insulin with 2 ml/kg of D10W.
   2. Start continuous infusions of dextrose and insulin
      a. Start dextrose infusion first using D10 at a rate of 5-10mL/kg/hr
      b. Once serum glucose is > 150 mg/dl start insulin by continuous infusion at 0.1 units/kg per hour.
      c. Check serum glucose levels q 30 minutes until stable in the 100-200 mg/dl range, then hourly.
      d. Stop insulin infusion if serum glucose < 100 mg/dl.

118 Part II-A: Fluids and Nutrition

L. Kayexalate® (sodium polystyrene sulfonate resin) orally or by retention enema. Calculate dose on basis of desired potassium exchange. 1 gm/kg of Kayexalate® will lower K+ by 1 mEq. Usual dose is 1 gm/kg/dose orally every 6 hrs or rectally every 2-6 hrs. Use with caution in premature infant, as they are associated with intestinal perforation and NEC.

M. If potassium does not correct or if the infant is anuric consider other measures such as exchange transfusion with washed red blood cells, hemofiltration or renal dialysis

<a id='ffa9e84e-f894-4951-8809-8fe57e59358b'></a>

V. **Differential Diagnosis**

A. Laboratory Studies: (monitor every 4-6 hrs.)

1. Electrolyte panel to detect other abnormalities such as metabolic acidosis.
2. CK to detect muscle injury, lactate to assess tissue death
3. BUN, creatinine and urinalysis to evaluate kidney function
4. CBC to evaluate for hemolysis
5. If endocrine etiology is suspected consult Endocrine service and send serum aldosterone and plasma renin

I. **Definition**

A. Normal neonatal serum potassium: 4-6.5 mEq/L

B. Mild hypokalemia: 3.5-3.9 mEq/L

C. Moderate hypokalemia: 2.5-3.5 mEq/L

D. Severe hypokalemia: < 2.5 mEq/L

II. **Principles**

A. Serum K value obtained by heel-stick may be spuriously higher due to hemolysis associated with heel-stick samples

B. Infants rarely manifest symptoms until hypokalemia is severe (unless on digoxin)

C. Symptoms: EKG changes include flattened T waves, prolonged QT interval, appearance of U waves. Severe hypokalemia can result in lethargy, constipation, ileus, and arrhythmias.

III. **Etiology**

A. Inadequate intake: normal maintenance is 1-2 mEq/kg/day

B. Losses associated with medication administration: lasix®, aldactazide®, xanthines, amphotericin, aminoglycosides, corticosteroids, epinephrine, bronchodilators.

C. Losses associated with GI dysfunction: diarrhea, NG drainage, vomiting (pyloric stenosis)

D. Renal loss: polyuria, RTA.

V. **Treatment**
A. Treat the cause: decrease diuretic dose, stop other meds that may be causing potassium shift, correct alkalosis, treat vomiting and diarrhea.
B. Avoid rapid replacement. Goal is to replete potassium stores over a 24-hour period. Rapid administration of IV potassium may cause arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.
C. Mild hypokalemia can be corrected by adding or increasing maintenance potassium in the IV infusion by 1-2 mEq/kg/day OR by starting PO potassium chloride 1-2 mEq/kg/day in 2-4 divided doses given with feeds.
D. Moderate hypokalemia. Replete with slow infusion of IV potassium 0.5 mEq/kg given over 1-2 hrs OR if infant is taking PO feedings start oral supplement of 2 mEq/kg/day in 2-4 divided doses. Infant must be on cardiorespiratory monitor for IV replacement. Serum potassium level should be monitored closely.
E. Severe hypokalemia. Replete with slow infusion of IV potassium 1 mEq/kg given over 2 hrs. Infant must be on cardiorespiratory monitor for IV replacement. Serum potassium level should be monitored closely.
F. If infant has severe GI losses consider starting replacement fluids of ½ normal saline with 20 mEq KCL/L. Replace 0.5 - 1 mL per ml of losses. Monitor serum potassium level closely.

I. **Definition**

Serum sodium < 135 mEq/L

II. **Signs and Symptoms**

Usually asymptomatic but may include irritability, lethargy, apnea, tremors, poor weight gain. Seizures can occur with severe hyponatremia (<120 mEq/L)

III. **Considerations**

A. Newborn kidney has low GFR and poor concentrating abilities

B. Premature infants have immature skin with high transepidermal water losses

C. **Normal serum sodium in the VLBW infant can range from 125-150.**

D. Maintenance sodium requirements = 2-4 mEq/kg/day. Higher in preterm after first week of life (3-5 mEq/kg/day)

E. Normal newborn urine output = 1-4 mL/kg/hr

F. Normal newborn specific gravity = 1.005 to 1.012

G. Normal newborn serum osmolality = 280-300 mOsm/L

H. Normal newborn urine osmolality = 100-400 mOsm/L

IV. **Common Causes of Hyponatremia**

A. Volume overload (usually presents with weight gain)

1. Excessive free water administration
2. Indomethacin - reduces free water clearance
3. Sepsis with decreasing cardiac output
4. Renal failure
5. Congestive heart failure
6. Paralytic ileus

B. Sodium deficit (usually presents with weight loss)

1. Prematurity with high renal Na losses
2. Inadequate Na intake

4. Renal failure with excess tubular Na excretion

5. Na loss from diarrhea, gastric losses, ascites, pleural fluid

C. SIADH (weight usually unchanged)

1. Central nervous system disorders (IVH, hydrocephalus, asphyxia, meningitis)

2. Pulmonary disorders (pneumothorax)

<a id='762c312f-0ef8-4111-add6-afd785895f90'></a>

## V. Diagnosis

Determine whether low sodium is due to **sodium deficit, volume overload or SIADH**

Increasing sodium administration in newborns with water excess may correct the hyponatremia but may result in volume overload which can cause issues with PDA or lead to BPD

1.  For isolated low Na value- send repeat stat sample to rule out lab error.
2.  Calculate intake and output to determine is renal compromise/fluid overload is contributing to low sodium
3.  Check weight trend. Hyponatremia with weight loss suggests sodium depletion. Hyponatremia with weight gain suggests water excess.
4.  Evaluate renal function- send serum BUN/Creatinine
5.  Consider sending urine sodium and osmolality and serum osmolality to evaluate for SIADH and renal sodium losses

VI. **Treatment of Sodium Depletion**

A. Sodium Deficit: treat with sodium administration

1. Mild hyponatremia (Na 126-135): correct over 24-48 hrs by increasing sodium administration either orally or parenterally. Infants on diuretic therapy often have mild hyponatremia which does not need to be corrected if it is >130 mEq/L.
2. Moderate hyponatremia (Na 120-125): calculate the sodium deficit using the following equation and give only half the amount over 12-24 hrs. Check serum sodium q 4 hrs stat to avoid too rapid correction.

<a id='da913cec-d387-4508-8f34-074ab4924f12'></a>

Na+ deficit (mEq/L) = [normal Na+ (mEq/L) - actual Na+ (mEq/L)] x wgt (kg) x 0.6

Give half replacement over 12-24 hrs.

For replacement fluids use Normal Saline or 3% NaCL

Try to avoid 3% NaCl for moderate or asymptomatic hyponatremia.

NS = 154 mEq/L (0.154 mEq/ml)

3% NaCl = 513 mEq/L (0.5 mEq/ml)

124 Part II-A: Fluids and Nutrition

**EXAMPLE:** 1 kg preterm infant with serum sodium of 120 and evidence of sodium deficit.
Na+ deficit = (135-120) (1) (0.6) = 9 mEq/L
Using NS: 9 / 0.154 = 58 ml
Give 29 ml of NS over 12-24 hrs. Check serum sodium q 4 hrs stat during replacement.

<a id='692a012b-81ac-45b6-af56-731fb3d8148a'></a>

3. Severe symptomatic hyponatremia (Na < 120 mEq/L and infant is seizing) – **Use above formula** calculate the amount of sodium needed to raise the serum Na to 125 mEq/L. Use 3% normal saline given over period of 4 hours. Rate of correction should be < 0.5 mEq/kg/hr. Check serum sodium STAT hourly during treatment to avoid too rapid correction. Rapid correction of hyponatremia in VLBW infants has been associated with higher incidence of CP, sensorineural hearing loss and behavioral problems.

<a id='690873fc-a60b-4097-a8f1-52cffa5149e9'></a>

B. Volume overload: Hyponatremia with weight gain suggests water excess - treat with fluid restriction

<a id='92077347-d818-420d-9dff-16654de73df3'></a>

C. SIADH: Hyponatremia with no edema, decreased urine output, increased urine sodium excretion, high specific gravity and urine osmolality >serum osmolality suggests **SIADH**-treat with fluid restriction. If serum sodium is less than 120, give lasix and sodium correction with 3% normal saline.

Ron Cohen, M.D. and William Benitz, M.D.

**Background**: Caring for a mechanically ventilated neonate continues to unnecessarily strike fear in the heart of many.
This fear is only amplified by the fact that we nursery folk speak a language all our own, rich with 3- and 4-letter
acronyms. By reviewing the physiology, and understanding the ventilator manipulations available, the task becomes
much less intimidating, even manageable. After reading this chapter, we hope you will find yourself more comfortable
managing ventilated babies and talking the talk; and should a child not play by the rules, as preemies have been known
to do, give your fellow a call. They will be happy to give you a hand.

I. **Indications for Mechanical Ventilation**

One, or a combination, of these may result in the need for mechanical ventilation:

A. Apnea
B. Hypoxemia
C. Hypercapnea or Hypoventilation

II. **Types of Mechanical Ventilators**

Simplistically, there are 3 types:

A. Volume Ventilators. These create breaths by inflating the lung with a prescribed tidal volume.
B. Pressure Control (PC). These create breaths by inflating the lung with a prescribed amount of pressure.
C. High Frequency Venilators. These will be covered in Chapter II.B, High Frequency Ventilation.

<a id='ab831b04-0d0d-472e-b0f4-5603c6aaf595'></a>

### III. Definitions of Mechanical Breaths

In order to understand ventilators, we need to discuss how mechanical breaths are described and controlled (see Figure 1). There are basically four parameters needed to be specified:

A. Time Paramaters

1. Rate, or frequency: the number of breaths per unit time.
2. Cycle time: this is the inverse of rate, or the unit of time for each breathing cycle, and is the sum of inspiratory time (Ti) + expiratory time (Te).
3. Inspiratory Time (Ti): the time spent during lung inflation.
4. Expiratory Time (Te): the time during which the ventilator is not trying to inflate the lung and expiration is allowed.
5. I:E Ratio: the ratio of Ti to Te.
6. When ordering mechanical breaths, only 2 parameters must be specified, since by simple math, setting any 2 determines the others. For example, on our standard ventilator, we set a rate and a Ti. If you have a

B. Pressure. Since a mechanical breath is divided into 2 parts, inspiration and expiration, the ventilator pressure generated during these must be specified:

1. Peak Inspiratory Pressure (PIP): The peak pressure reached during inspiration. PIP is used to expand the lung during Ti with pressure ventilators, but is just a measurement or alarm when using volume ventilation.

2. Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP): The minimal pressure allowed by the ventilator during expiration. PEEP is used to prevent atelectasis and maintain "functional residual capacity (FRC)". This has important implications for lung function that we will discuss further (see Figure 2).

A dashed rectangular region on the steep, linear portion of the curve is annotated with the text: "This is the region you want to be in to get the most volume for the least pressure = the most compliance". Below the x-axis, the text reads: "Slope of line = ΔV/ΔP = compliance".

C. Volume. When using a pressure ventilator, the volume of gas delivered is measured; with volume ventilation, the desired volume of the breath is set on the ventilator and the amount of pressure (PIP) needed to deliver the breath is measured.
D. Flow. With current ventilators, flow is determined automatically by the machine but can be displayed on the monitors.

IV. **Non-invasive Ventilatory Support**

A. Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP). This is the least invasive type of ventilatory support except for nasal cannula. There is only 1 number to order – the amount of pressure in the circuit transmitted to the patient's nares. CPAP is applied throughout the respiratory cycle. CPAP is of benefit to children who have

128 Part II-B: Respiratory

lungs prone to collapse, such as babies with stiff lungs due to RDS or pneumonia. By keeping the lung inflated, CPAP helps the lung to function in a happier part of the compliance curve. Using the analogy of the lung as a balloon, the hardest part of inflating it is overcoming the initial opening pressure (the first blow on the balloon), we usually start with a CPAP of 4-6 cm H2O. Once it's open, lung distension requires less pressure. CPAP provides the opening pressure in a lung prone to collapse, decreasing the work of breathing for the infant and increasing functional residual capacity, improving both oxygenation and ventilation.

B. Non-invasive Positive Pressure Ventilation (NIPPV). Sometimes referred to as CPAP with a rate, this mode adds machine breaths (PIP) to CPAP, but is delivered via a nasal cannula just like nasal CPAP. Thus, a rate, PIP, PEEP, and Ti are ordered whenever NIPPV is used.

<a id='9926d856-253c-470e-93f6-afe6a6212f5c'></a>

V. **Modes on Endotracheal Tube Mechanical Ventilation**

This is where is gets tricky, as there are several different modes of mechanical ventilation that can be used. The basics described above apply, but each delivers breaths in significantly different ways that have specific clinical implications.

A. Synchronized Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation (SIMV). See Figure 3. This is the simplest of the modes currently employed. In SIMV, the ventilator attempts to synchronize mechanical breaths with patient breaths, but the "intermittent mandatory" means that in an apneic or anesthetized patient, the ventilator will deliver the number of breaths/min set by you. If the patient breaths faster than the set rate, the ventilator will not give more breaths, but the patient will be able to draw breaths from the circuit. Orders for SIMV therefore require:

1. Rate
2. Ti
3. PIP
4. PEEP

- A bracket: Cycle Time
: chart::>

<a id='989a7f7f-7cfd-482a-899e-79922eb76ec8'></a>

B. Assist/Control (AC). See Figure 4. This mode is similar to SIMV in that there is a set minimum number of breaths that the ventilator will deliver. Breaths will be synchronized with patient efforts if there are any. However, unlike SIMV, if the patient breaths at a higher rate than the minimum "control" rate, the ventilator will deliver an assist breath at the same PIP, PEEP, and Ti that is ordered. Thus, in A/C, the rate is a minimum rate; with SIMV it is both the minimum and maximum ventilator rate. Thus, like SIMV, orders for A/C require:

<a id='2c2d7ca4-cc04-4fb3-a60f-2274a0566e15'></a>

1. Rate (is the minimum)

<a id='606781fd-ffd7-45a5-ab4e-56ef43830178'></a>

C. Volume Guarantee (VG). See Figure 5. This is a method of adding a safety limit to PC ventilation and can be used in conjunction with SIMV or A/C. Once SIMV or A/C is ordered, a VG volume, in mL/kg, can be ordered. Computers in the ventilator will assess the previous several breaths, and try to determine the minimal PIP needed to achieve the desired target tidal volume. If the set PIP is too low, the ventilator will alarm. However, if it is possible to achieve the volume target at a lower PIP, the ventilator will, in essence, "auto-wean" the PIP. For example, if you set a PIP maximum of 20 and the baby only requires a PIP of 12 to achieve your desired volumes, it only delivers a PIP of 12.

<a id='5e8031ff-b444-4226-8d93-725ec5192a67'></a>

1. This is a nice mode to use initially with a sick baby requiring high PIP, since it allows the weaning to begin as the patient's compliance improves without having to wait to see either hypocarbia or hyperexpansion on CXR.
2. Because the ventilator uses data from the last breath to set the pressure for the next one, which cannot "guarantee" delivery of the desired volume, this mode might be more accurately described as "volume targeted" ventilation.
3. This mode may produce ventilator behaviors that appear anomalous to the uninitiated. The ventilator will shorten the inspiratory time if the desired volume has already been delivered and it may reduce the inspiratory pressure to equal the end expiratory pressure as the baby's lung function and respiratory effort improve. The latter will result in placement of the infant on CPAP via the endotracheal tube, which is usually not desirable

<::chart: The chart displays two synchronized graphs, one for "Pressure" and one for "Volume", over time, illustrating a volume guarantee mechanism. The top graph shows "Pressure" with a dotted horizontal line labeled "PIP Limit" at the top and a solid brown baseline. The bottom graph shows "Volume" with a dotted horizontal line labeled "V<sub>T</sub> Target" and a solid brown baseline. Two distinct cycles are depicted.

In the first cycle:
- The "Pressure" curve rises to a peak, reaching the "PIP Limit", then plateaus briefly before falling. A red dashed vertical line extends from the peak of the pressure curve down to the volume curve.
- The "Volume" curve rises, reaching the "V<sub>T</sub> Target", and then falls.

In the second cycle:
- The "Pressure" curve rises to a peak that is below the "PIP Limit". A solid red horizontal line indicates a plateau pressure. A red dashed vertical line extends from the peak of the pressure curve down to the volume curve.
- The "Volume" curve rises, reaching the "V<sub>T</sub> Target", and then falls. This indicates that the volume target is met even when the peak inspiratory pressure is lower than the PIP limit.::>

b: Pressure Control with Volume Guarantee

<a id='3e7dca21-cdda-4fc5-9b78-8fe47bcd74fa'></a>

A. Pressure Support (PS). See Figure 6. This mode is a variant of A/C that almost always is used in conjunction with SIMV. The name is surprisingly logical; the ventilator provides pressure to support any patient breath detected. What differentiates PS from A/C is:

1. The duration of the pressure support (the PS Ti if you will) is determined by patient effort. The breath is initiated and terminated by the patient.
2. The pressure ordered for PS is actually the pressure added to the PEEP. Thus, if you order a PS of 6 and a PEEP of 6, the maximum inspiratory pressure achieved during a PS breath will be 6+6=12.
3. Since PS allows the patient to determine rate and Ti, this is a very comfortable mode for the patient.
4. Conversely, for very sick patients, PS may not provide adequate support.
5. Note, too, that when used in conjunction with SIMV, the patient may experience 2 very different kinds of breaths; the SIMV breath can have a longer fixed Ti and a higher PIP than the PS breaths. For example, an infant might be supported with SIMV at a rate of 15 and PIP of 20 along with pressure support of 8 for all other spontaneous breaths. In this mode, the baby contributes to ventilator breaths and sets the rate.
6. Thus, PS is usually reserved for more stable chronic patients in conjunction with SIMV delivering full tidal volumes at a rate substantially lower than the baby's spontaneous rate.

Figure 6: SIMV with Pressure Support
<::chart: The chart displays a timeline of breaths in SIMV (Synchronized Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation) with Pressure Support. The x-axis represents time, and the y-axis likely represents pressure or flow. Two large, red, trapezoidal shapes indicate "Pressure Control Breaths." Between these two, there are two smaller, blue, arch-shaped curves representing "Pressure Support Breaths." Small yellow triangles are visible at the base of the red trapezoids and under the blue arches, indicating "Patient Effort." A bracket below the blue arches spans the duration of these breaths, labeled "Cycle Time." To the right of the main chart, a legend defines the symbols:
- A red trapezoidal outline is labeled "Pressure Control Breath."
- A yellow triangle is labeled "Patient Effort."
- A blue arch-shaped outline is labeled "Pressure Support Breath."
- A curly bracket is labeled "Cycle Time."::>

## VI. Adjusting the Ventilator

A. PEEP. As discussed above, PEEP determines FRC, and has a major impact on compliance and oxygenation. Determining the optimum PEEP to keep the patient's lungs in the "sweet spot" of the compliance curve (Figure 2) is a bit of an art.

1. Starting PEEP is usually in the 4 - 6 cmH2O range.
2. A sicker, less compliant lung will need more PEEP to keep open.
3. As lung function improves, PEEP will need to be lowered to avoid "gas trapping" and hyperinflation.
4. Increasing PEEP recruits more lung surface area for gas exchange, and is a common first maneuver to improve oxygenation.

B. PIP. This is the major determinant of tidal volume in PC mode. Initially, PIP is adjusted based upon chest

movement and listening for gas exchange.

1. Starting PIP is usually in the 15 – 20 cmH2O range.
2. Sicker, less compliant lungs will need more PIP to create an adequate tidal volume.
3. As lung function improves, PIP will need to be lowered to avoid over-distention, volutrauma, and potentially air-leaks (e.g., pneumothorax, interstitial emphysema).
4. Increasing PIP generally increases tidal volume, and is a common first maneuver to improve ventilation.

<a id='6be1c84c-c8d7-4f2b-830f-00769b57fb0b'></a>

C. Tidal Volume. If using VG, target tidal volumes need to be set.

1.  VLBW infants: 4 - 5 mL/kg initially.
2.  Larger Premies infants: 5 - 6 mL/kg.
3.  Sick Term infants: 6-8 mL/kg.
4.  Note that over time the necessary setting for VLBW infants will increase slowly; by 3-4 weeks of age,
    5-6 mL/kg may be needed.

D. Rate. Using AC allows patients to set their own rate. Neonates with RDS tend to be tachypneic, and may
breathe at 60 - 80 breaths/min. This is fine as long as the Ti is short enough to prevent an inverse I:E ratio
(See Ti below).

1.  Starting rate are usually around 40 with either AC or SIMV.
2.  With SIMV, increasing the rate is a good way to increase minute ventilation and thus improve ventilation.
3.  Once patients start improving, the rate can be lowered.
4.  In SIMV, a low level of PS allows patients to breath between PC breaths with less work of breathing, and
improves ventilation.

<a id='b2889e79-7a9e-4e20-80c7-f222ed35919e'></a>

E. Ti. At LPCH, we usually start with a Ti of 0.35 seconds. This is long enough to provide a short inspiratory pause, useful for recruiting areas of micro-atelectasis.

1. Longer Ti's have been associated with an increased incidence of air-leaks.
2. Spontaneous breaths, such as PS, will commonly use even shorter Ti's, frequently in the 0.20 sec range; this is acceptable for this mode, especially with adequate PEEP and PC breaths to prevent atelectasis.
3. With severe acute lung disease, or chronic lung disease complicated by increased airway resistance, longer Ti's may be needed.
4. Increasing Ti thus is another method for improving oxygenation, but is reserved for these special situations. If increasing Ti, it is imperative that you pay close attention to the I:E ratio!

<a id='059fc0e2-5032-4ce8-bdda-f3b49125cd51'></a>

F. Oxygenation. Maneuvers to increase PaO2 or SpO2 include:
1. Increase FiO2.
2. Increase PEEP.

5. Increase Ti.

G. Ventilation. Maneuvers to lower PaCO2 include:

1. Increase rate.
2. Increase PIP or VG.
3. Decrease PEEP (thus increasing the difference between PIP and PEEP).
4. Increase Ti (this may increase tidal volume, but can also cause air trapping

VII. **How to Handle a Bad Blood gas (a systematic approach):**

A. So, you've got a lousy blood gas:

1.  Figure out what's going on (oxygenation, ventilation or acid-base problem)
2.  Evaluate the baby
3.  Call for help if confused or unsure
4.  Make an intervention if necessary

B. As far as what's going on...

1.  Is there acidosis, and if so is it metabolic or respiratory?
2.  Look at the baby. Comfortable? Upset? Agitation is common in babies whose ventilation is sub-optimal.

C. If you have a metabolic acidosis (i.e., base deficit with normal PaCO2)

1.  Is baby dry? If so, consider a bolus.
2.  Does baby need base? Some little babies may, as their kidneys aren't very good at retaining base – consider acetate or sodium bicarbonate.
3.  Could baby be septic?
4.  You can make a ventilator change as respiratory compensation is faster than metabolic compensation, but you have to address the underlying metabolic acidosis.

D. If you're dealing with a respiratory problem, troubleshoot first.

<::chart: The image displays three pressure-volume (P-V) loops, each illustrating a different respiratory issue. 

**Chart 1: Initial Overshoot of Pressure, Rise time too High**
This P-V loop shows Volume (V) on the y-axis and Pressure (P) on the x-axis. The loop starts at the origin, moves upwards and to the right, then curves back downwards and to the left, returning to the origin. A distinct 'beak' or overshoot is visible at the end of the inspiratory phase (top right corner), with a dashed box highlighting this area. This pattern indicates an initial overshoot of pressure and a rise time that is too high.

**Chart 2: Obstruction (Think mucus plug, bronchospasm)**
This P-V loop also shows Volume (V) on the y-axis and Pressure (P) on the x-axis. The loop is very narrow and elongated, almost appearing as a thin, slightly separated line. It starts at the origin, moves upwards and to the right, and returns along a path very close to the inspiratory limb, forming a thin, closed loop. This pattern is characteristic of an obstruction, such as a mucus plug or bronchospasm.

**Chart 3: Leak (Think ETT leak, Pneumothorax)**
This P-V loop shows Volume (V) on the y-axis and Pressure (P) on the x-axis. The loop starts at the origin, moves upwards and to the right, but the expiratory limb does not return to the origin, indicating a loss of volume. The loop forms an open-ended shape, resembling a leaf or teardrop, with the bottom left not closing. This pattern suggests a leak, such as an ETT leak or pneumothorax.::>

**High Frequency Ventilation**

<a id='dd4f4ac8-e462-419e-a65f-40e2e79d1c8b'></a>

Ron Cohen, M.D.

I. **Background**

A. Definition: High Frequency Ventilation [HFV] is defined by:

1. Ventilator rates generally greater than 120 breaths per minute [bpm], or 2 breaths per second [Hz];
2. Tidal volumes [VT] less than dead space.

B. The use of such small tidal volumes generally requires maintaining higher mean airway pressures [Paw] to avoid atelectasis.

C. For conventional ventilation:

Minute Ventilation μ (VT) x (Rate)

D. However, HFV minute ventilation is more dependent upon rate:

Minute Ventilation μ (VT) x (Rate)²

E. Types of HFV

1. High Frequency Jet Ventilation [HFJV]: This is a type of HFV that is characterized by the injection of high-velocity gas boluses into the airway over a very short inspiratory time followed by passive expiration. Most common example in US NICU is the Bunnell Jet. The jet is not used in the LPCH NICU.

2. High Frequency Oscillatory Ventilation [HFOV]: This type of HFV operates using oscillatory movements of a piston in-line with the respiratory gas flow, resulting in active movement of air both during inspiration and during the expiratory. The most common example in US NICUS is the Sensormedics 3100A.

a. Rigid ventilator circuit is needed to avoid volume loss due to tubing expansion between the baby and the HFOV.
b. The active expiratory phase allows HFOV to run at somewhat higher frequencies than HFJV, but makes either gas trapping or atelectasis a concern.

<a id='bb483cdc-203e-45e3-bc2c-1992bb82d212'></a>

II. **Indications**

A. HFV was originally developed as a "rescue" treatment for pulmonary air leak situations.

B. Subsequent studies indicated it could be useful for "rescue" of severe pulmonary hypertension and pre- ECMO patients.

C. Recent trials have demonstrated efficacy for treatment of RDS.

D. Studies have shown that iNO may be more effective when used in conjunction with HFV.

E. Improvements in conventional ventilators and their management have tended to obscure the difference between HFV and conventional ventilation. Nevertheless, many centers still resort to HFV when patients either:

   1. Have persistent hypoventilation despite increased pressures

2. Have pulmonary interstitial emphysema or pneumothoraces while requiring mechanical ventilation at high pressures
3. Have persistent hypoxemia on high FiO2 despite high Paw
4. Are approaching criteria for iNO or ECMO.

<a id='6b1191a0-1625-4dd3-ab43-27ddc565da53'></a>

III. **Transition to HFV [See Table]**

A. Baseline preparations

1. Chest x-Rays [CxR]
   a. Determine expansion
   b. Check for interstitial emphysema or pneumothorax
2. Blood gases [ABG]
3. Final conventional settings
4. Nurse, Respiratory Care Practitioner[s], MD/NNP all prepared and present as rapid adjustments may be needed.

B. Make sure HFOV is calibrated and ready to take over respiratory support before discontinuing conventional ventilation. Assure patient positioned appropriately for rigid circuit.

C. Starting settings when converting to HFV

1. PEEP or Paw
   a. The tiny VT used for HFV makes atelectasis a risk
   b. PEEP or Paw is increased 1-2 cmH20 above conventional
   c. Too low a PEEP or Paw increases risk of hyperventilation
   d. The exception is when treating "air leak"; in this situation, the PEEP or Paw is generally NOT increased since "degassing" the lung and allowing some atelectasis may be the desired result.
2. PIP or Amplitude [DP]:
   a. Usually start about the same as conventional
   b. Adjust by watching abdominal "jiggle".
3. Rate or Frequency [f]
   a. Oscillator runs in the 8 - 12 Hz range
4. Second determinant of rate or f is patient size:
   a. Size is a major contributor to time constant

CAPTION ERROR

<a id='2d4963ce-799b-4a9d-bccf-86a175fe5327'></a>

b. Smaller patients = shorter time constant
c. Start smaller patients at higher end of range

<a id='c49b3e1e-09f3-497a-95d1-4ff80a1a9f5a'></a>

5. Third determinant of rate or f is disease state:
   a. Diseases with low compliance [e.g., RDS] have shorter time constant and thus use rate or f at the higher end of range
   b. Airways diseases [e.g., MAS, PIE] have longer time constants and thus are best at the lower end of the rate or f range
   c. As RDS improves and compliance increases, you may need to decrease the rate to avoid "gas trapping"

6. The risk of too high a rate or f is "gas trapping" - when in doubt and there is CO2 retention, consider slowing rate or f, The Oscillator has a fixed I:E Ratio = 1:3, thus decreased f:
   a. Increases Ti resulting in a larger VT
   b. Increases Te allowing better exhalation

7. In general, changing rate or f significantly means moving by 1 Hz or by 60 bpm; smaller changes are usually not significant clinically.

<a id='be0f3d8f-01d5-446c-8042-fed02db0eebd'></a>

IV. Adjusting HFV in Clinical Use [See Figures 1 – 4]

A. Oxygenation: As with any ventilator, the major determinants of Oxygenation are FiO2 and Paw. As with all ventilators, Paw is a product of PIP, PEEP, and I:E ratio.

1. Paw is set directly with HFOV and can adjusted in increments of 0.5 cmH2O
2. Remember that increasing Paw results in an increased PIP but also an increase in PEEP
3. Thus, after several increases in Paw, consider increasing amplitude to avoid having a Paw that is too high.
4. Similarly, after several decreases in Paw, consider decreasing amplitude to avoid having a Paw that is too low.
5. After significant Paw changes, follow-up CxR is needed to monitor for hyperexpansion or atelectasis.

B. Ventilation: As with any ventilator, the major determinant of PaCO2 is minute ventilation [see equation, section I.D.], which is more sensitive to changes in VT than rate or f with HFV. Adjust DP up or down to increase or decrease VT:

1. Increasing DP at a set Paw results in increased PIP but also decreased PEEP
2. Thus, after several increases in DP, consider increasing Paw to avoid having a PEEP that is too low.
3. Conversely, several decreases in permit weaning of Paw to avoid over inflation.
4. The worst way to ventilate is to compensate for too little PEEP [atelectasis] by using too much PIP [volutrauma]. Thus, when having trouble ventilating with HFV:

High Frequency Ventilation 139

<a id='e3fff4ac-6c74-425d-a283-78d5901b10ff'></a>

a. Consider above points & make sure PEEP not too low
b. Frequent CxR are needed to assess lung volumes. If hyperexpanded, considered decreasing the rate or f.

<a id='430e1a3c-7560-41fc-ae78-e935446e7787'></a>

5. Remember that prolonged hyperventilation with any mode of ventilation increases the risk of cerebrovascular constriction, decreased brain blood flow, and neurologic injury.

<a id='0859323d-21f6-4272-87ed-0cc0c8ac7bb5'></a>

V. **Transitioning off HFV to Conventional Ventilation.**

A. Some NICUs will extubate directly from HFV.

B. If transition to conventional ventilation is desired, most NICU have criteria for HFV settings prior to transition:

1.  FiO2 generally ~ 40%
2.  Paw generally ~ 12 cmH2O.
3.  Conventional setting can be chosen by reversing the process for choosing initial HFV settings:
    a. Same PIP or DP & adjust per chest excursion
    b. Paw about the same as HFV if oxygenating well
    c. Rate about 40 bpm
    d. Check ABG & CxR shortly after transition [15-30 min

VI. **Laws of High Frequency Ventilation**

A. **Frequency Based on Machine and Weight:**

1.  Range determined by device
2.  Within the device range, _f_ determined by size
    a. Mice breathe faster than elephants

142 Part II-B: Respiratory
Nasal Cannula Oxygen Delivery – High Flow and Low Flow

<a id='b3a0b843-dc09-4e9e-8b1e-f0af9f869bd9'></a>

Arlene Sheehan, N.N.P-B.C

I. NICU Definitions

A. High Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC): \u22652 LPM (max 8 LPM) delivered with high flow nasal prongs using a system that can deliver heated, humidified gas.

B. Low Flow Nasal Cannula (LFNC): 0.1-1 LPM delivered via a humidifcation system using standard nasal prongs.

<a id='e6f50dda-4443-4504-9602-b421d47cdcc5'></a>

II. **Considerations**

A. High flow nasal cannula MUST BE non-occlusive (defined as 50-80% of nares diameter). The principal mechanism by which HFNC supports respiratory effort appears to be by flushing the nasopharyngeal 'dead space', increasing alveolar ventilation and reducing CO2 retention. "Prong leak" is crucial to proper function of the cannula Occlusive prongs may cause trauma or high intrapulmonary pressure. Greater prong leak may increase flushing of gas and management of hypercapnia.

B. Pressure generated by HFNC differs from CPAP because it is not set or measured. Evidence shows that esophageal pressure generated by HFNC is similar to or less than pressure set by CPAP. Pressure generation varies between patients with varying leak at the mouth and nose. HFNC generates higher pressures in smaller infants. ²

C. LFNC delivery systems are not heated and humidified and should be limited to gas flow ranges of 0.1 to1.0 LPM.

D. HFNC used only in NICU. Wean to standard nasal cannula flow of ≤0.5 LPM to go to ICN 1 or 2.

### III. Indications

A. As initial support mode for the term infant with respiratory distress.

   1. Should not be used as a initial support mode for the preterm infant with RDS. A multi-center trial showed HFNC resulted in greater treatment failure in this population than CPAP.

B. Post extubation for term or near term infants (see Respiratory Care Bundle for extubation guidelines of preterm infants)

C. Weaning from CPAP

1. FiO2 delivery range is 21-40%. If patient is requiring more than 40% FiO2, consider CPAP or intubation
2. FiO2 delivery range is 21-40%. If patient is requiring more than 40%, consider CPAP or intubation
