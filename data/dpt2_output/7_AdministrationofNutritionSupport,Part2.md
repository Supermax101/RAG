* Dependent on type of feeding tube used:
  * Gastrostomy
  * Transgastric jejunostomy
    * Be aware the use of each lumen and avoid medication administration into stomach when concerns about suctioning the medication before it can be absorbed may occur (e.g., proton pump inhibitors)
* 50% of patients experience ingredient-related diarrhea when using enteral access tubes for medication administration (especially sorbitol-containing medications)
* Many liquid formulations of medications have osmolalities far exceeding that of the GI tract
  * Diarrhea, cramping, abdominal distention, and vomiting

• Nasoduodenal
• Nasojejunal
• Jejunostomy
  - Significant risk of drug-nutrient interactions as both food (enteral nutrition) and medications are administered concurrently
  - Post-pyloric administration assumes the medication can be absorbed where it enters the GI tract
    • Intestinal site of absorption of most medications is lacking
    • Potential increased toxicity due to lack of degradation from gastric acid or decreased first-pass metabolism (e.g., azathioprine)
    • Treatment failure

*   Avoid solid dosage form medications resulting in a significant change in absorption of the active ingredient if opened (e.g., capsule) or crushed (e.g., tablet)

    *   Consider alternative dosage form, drug or route of administration

            *   May lead to occluded feeding tube

• Only crush simple compressed tablets to fine powder and mix with purified water
• Only open hard gelatin capsules and mix powder containing the immediate release medication with purified water
• Provide feeding tube irrigation around the timing of drug administration
  - Prior to medication administration, stop the enteral feeding and flush the tube with at least 15 mL water
  - Administer the medication using a clean ENFIT syringe
  - Flush the tube again with at least 15 mL water
  - Repeat with the next medication
  - Restart the enteral feeding in a timely manner

* Venous access device determines parenteral drug compatibility in the setting of PN
  - Single lumen catheters are the greatest challenge as separate IV administration of other medications with PN is not always possible
    * If simultaneous IV administration with PN is inevitable, utilize available IV drug compatibility resources (e.g., Handbook of Injectable Drugs)
    * Y-site administration has limited published resources with PN
      - 106 drugs evaluated with 83 deemed compatible
      - Incompatible drugs included: acyclovir, amphotericin B, haloperidol, heparin, lorazepam, ondansetron
  * Contact manufacturer(s) for new PN or ILE product compatibility

## MANAGING PN WITH SEPARATE ILE INFUSIONS

*   Possible threats to inadvertent PN administrations
    *   Both PN and separate ILE on same IV pole
        *   Using 2 separate pumps increases risk for rate error
            *   Double check of pump settings needed by 2nd nurse prior to start of infusions
    *   Inadequate room lighting
        *   Routinely trace lines back to source
    *   Lines confused despite color differences of IV products
    *   Confusion of rates of PN and separate ILE
    *   Omission of in-line filter placement

**Disadvantages**

    * Requires 1.2 micron in-line filter as for all PN formulations
* Risk of ILE instability

# CONCLUSIONS

* Safe use of medication administration via an enteral feeding tube requires:
  - Knowledge of proximal end of tube in GI tract for drug absorption
  - Osmolality of medication and use of other excipients such as sorbitol
  - Dosage form that is immediate release
  - Adequate flushing of the feeding tube before and after medication
* Safe use of medication administration via Y-site with PN requires:
  - Confirmed drug compatibility (e.g., Handbook of Injectable Drugs)
  - Other IV site or enteral options if no compatibility information exists
* Use of PN with separate ILE infusion increases the risk of administration errors
