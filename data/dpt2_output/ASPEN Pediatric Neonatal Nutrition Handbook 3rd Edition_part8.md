Protein provision should be 0.8–1.5 g/kg or 15%–20% of total calories from high biologic value source; this will need to be monitored and reassessed carefully. Fat provision should be 25%–30% of total calories with choices of appropriate sources of essential fatty acids as well as healthy fat selections; this may be a trigger for patients, and support should be offered for positive health recovery and outcomes.6

<a id='b9a7c920-cb79-434f-bebb-bb437f2a0179'></a>

Fluids are critical for hydration, and orthostatic pulse and blood pressure need to be monitored from lying, sitting, and standing per hospital or program policy. All patients should have intakes and outputs closely monitored.6

<a id='c6e643b0-9f7d-45e8-865e-d6b3bb046566'></a>

The clinical professional should take daily opportunities to reassess health and medical status using orthostatic fluid and cardiac measurements and using NFPE assessment for edema, swelling, capillary refill, pitting of skin, skin quality and integrity, as well as thinking errors and cognition. 1,6,10

<a id='3f182f75-a50f-45cd-b3cc-2f167bb682e0'></a>

Micronutrient deficiencies often occur in patients with disordered eating, especially in the setting of restrictive eating. Common deficiencies include zinc, B vitamins (especially thiamin),⁹ and vitamin D. Most patients will benefit from the initial multivitamin with a mineral supplement. Obtain initial laboratory value markers upon admission. Reassessment of laboratory values per program or policy, or alignment with medical condition of the patient may be necessary. If there is no policy, monitor electrolytes and hydration markers as well as liver profile weekly until the patient is stable in weight gain, intake, and medical status. ¹,⁴⁻⁶

<a id='6cea230a-7ebe-40a7-ace1-bfc4f9a7bb81'></a>

Mealtime should be calm, and clinical professionals should offer
patient support and discussion as needed. Times of eating should be
limited to about 20–30 minutes per hospital or program policy. Meals and
snacks should incorporate a variety of foods and fluids that meet nutrient

<a id='e329f187-1932-4e1d-9ed3-e6f3d55508d4'></a>

needs in addition to stabilization of health. An example nutrition support

The interdisciplinary team should be unified and maintain communication throughout the process of treatment and care.¹ During treatment, close monitoring of the patient is required. Monitoring should include documentation of intake by type and amount, assessment for behaviors like hiding food (possibly in clothing or on person), throwing food away, and excessive physical activity (eg, pacing, exercise in room, exercise in shower, or tensing muscles). The care team should also monitor boundaries with other patients, challenges or triggers, and anxiety. ¹,⁶

Enteral Nutrition Support and Route of Feeding

<a id='cecfe9b3-50e8-45cc-8c3c-62efce24f870'></a>

Disordered eating and eating disorders are complex and in treatment,
when patient is refusing oral intake, a decision to initiate enteral nutrition
is relative to medical status. Use of the nasogastric (NG) route is
preferred with relative ease of administration as well as mimicry of usual
meal or snack times. In cases in which long-term enteral support is
needed, some success is reported with NG tube placement when purging
is not an issue.<sup>6</sup> Parenteral nutrition is only indicated for patients with
digestive inability or in severely malnourished patients, but this method
does not aid in hunger cues.<sup>1,6,7</sup>

<a id='fef412a0-c3c2-438a-bbe0-8255c85cd7c2'></a>

**Refeeding Syndrome**
Re-initiation of carbohydrate-containing feeding of severely malnourished patients may result in refeeding syndrome, in which there are acute intracellular shifts of electrolytes as cell anabolism is stimulated.9,11 Refeeding syndrome can affect cardiac, respiratory, hepatic, cognition, neuromuscular, other various complications, and even death.9,11 Refeeding may occur when patients over-report intake in instances of starvation and can occur even with initiation of dextrose-continuing-intravenous fluids. Careful monitoring for refeeding syndrome is required for all at-risk patients. See chapter 6, "Parenteral Nutrition," for a further discussion of refeeding syndrome.

<a id='4b3ed65f-56fd-4b0b-aa33-4129a801e8cf'></a>

# Summary

Daily monitoring includes multiple factors during the treatment and implementation of the nutrition plan such as observation for food acceptance, appropriate weight gain, fewer compensatory behaviors, stable medical status, normalized laboratory values, appropriate cardiac function and orthostatic measures, and behavioral and therapeutic advances. Imperative to continued success is support for both patient and family, including a stable aftercare plan to ensure continuum of care to monitor the patient's status for nutrition as well as medical and overall mental health.

# Introduction

Dyslipidemia is defined as a disorder of lipoprotein metabolism that leads to 1 or more of the following abnormal findings: elevated total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (HDL-C).¹ There are 2 forms of dyslipidemia: primary and secondary. Primary dyslipidemias are caused by genetic anomalies, and secondary dyslipidemias are caused by other conditions.² Table 16-1 provides a list of primary and secondary dyslipidemias.

The prevalence of dyslipidemia in US children (ages 6–19 years) is about 20%.³ Dyslipidemia is a key risk factor for coronary heart disease and stroke.⁴ Exposure to cardiovascular risk factors early in life has been found to contribute to the development of structural and functional vascular changes related to atherosclerosis.⁵ Because heart disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States, timely and effective treatment of dyslipidemia in the pediatric population is imperative to help prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD) later in life.⁶,⁷

## Assessment and Nutrient Requirements

<a id='55e7943e-95e7-47c0-930e-0cdb8ea50c98'></a>

Universal lipid screening is recommended between 9 and 11 years of age.5 If a nonfasting sample is obtained, calculate the non–HDL-C (TC – HDL-C). If non–HDL-C > 145 mg/dL + HDL < 40 mg/dL, a fasting (nothing to eat or drink for 10–12 hours) lipid profile via venipuncture two times should be obtained, and the results should be averaged.5 Table 16-2 provides lipoprotein reference ranges.

Once two reliable fasting lipid profiles are obtained, review the breakdown of the lipid profiles, analyzing the various lipoprotein abnormalities that comprise the TC value. By determining which particular lipoproteins are out of range, specific dietary, lifestyle, and pharmacotherapy recommendations can then be provided (see Table 16-3).

## Implementation of Nutrition Plan and Monitoring

### *Step 1: History and Education*

Obtain a detailed patient dietary history and family history of lipid abnormalities, premature CVD, and weight history; assess physical activity status; and educate/counsel the patient based on the findings.

<a id='b19a7203-642c-4266-819e-055f0a56574a'></a>

# Diet
Education regarding a healthy dietary pattern is important, especially for the pediatric population. Focusing on a healthy eating pattern can help prevent patients and their families from feeling overwhelmed with counting grams of food consumption and calculating percentages of daily macronutrient intake. MyPlate is a great place to start. See MyPlate.gov for education materials. At each meal, 1/2 of the plate should be fruits/vegetables, 1/4 should be grains, and 1/4 should be protein; 2-3 servings of low-fat or fat-free dairy should be consumed daily. When educating a patient with dyslipidemia using the MyPlate method, focus should be on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, lean protein

<a id='0e7cb085-db8c-4ac3-8ad5-d8bbca40f0d9'></a>

sources, low-fat or fat-free dairy products, and healthy fat sources as well as limiting processed foods and sugary beverage intake.⁸

<a id='038ba533-463b-4cc4-a8fd-afee2dd4242e'></a>

**Weight**
If a patient's weight is over or equal to the 85th percentile, discuss
achieving and maintaining a healthy weight. See chapter 25, "Weight
Management and Obesity," for more detailed recommendations.

<a id='9cf2d6b7-463c-4524-afa2-7984d5301388'></a>

**Physical Activity**

Encourage the patient to increase physical activity level with a goal of 1 hour daily of moderate-to-vigorous activity. It helps to brainstorm with the patient the types of aerobic activity that interest them and that they feel they could sustain.

<a id='f6633ce2-149b-486b-9a0c-a949a1bdf789'></a>

**Step 2: Plan**

Review fasting lipid profile laboratory results to determine the abnormal lipoproteins, and provide the patient with more detailed education/counseling on specific dietary recommendations based on the lipid profile makeup. Table 16-4 specifies thorough nutrition recommendations for the various dyslipidemias.

# Introduction

There are over 750 identified inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) to date, with some presenting at birth and others presenting later in life.¹ Some IEM can present with symptoms of acute metabolic crisis, whereas others develop clinical manifestations over time.² For most IEM, there is a range of severity that is dictated by the degree of enzyme or cofactor deficiency, resulting in both early and later-onset clinical presentations.³ Most IEM are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern wherein both parents are asymptomatic carriers, each passing the genetic variant to their offspring.¹

<a id='6696f28a-caad-4f2b-949c-70cfedaa3358'></a>

Newborn screening (NBS) has transformed the outcomes for infants with IEM by allowing for early diagnosis and management. For NBS, blood is collected on a filter paper card from an infant's heel within 24-48 hours following birth.¹ NBS laboratory tests use tandem mass spectrometry technology to detect multiple disorders from amino acid and acylcarnitine analysis from dried blood spots.⁴ The Recommended Uniform Screening Panel from the Department of Health and Human Services is a national guideline of core and secondary conditions to include in screening programs. ¹,⁵

<a id='dae1337b-4a98-4ecb-9e05-08791dd164d4'></a>

There is a high risk of acute metabolic crises with many IEM and symptoms may be present before NBS results become available.3 These events can also occur during subsequent catabolic events such as illness, surgery, injury, and the postpartum period. The increase in energy needs and rapid accumulation of toxic metabolites can lead to life-threatening emergencies. Presentations in a neonate in a metabolic crisis vary with the disorder, but some common signs and symptoms can include failure to thrive, vomiting, lethargy, fluctuating muscle tone, respiratory failure, hepatic dysfunction, cardiac abnormalities, seizures, and/or coma.2,6 Presenting laboratory abnormalities can include hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis (high anion gap), ketonemia/ketonuria, lactic acidosis, hyperammonemia, abnormal liver function markers, and/or thrombocytopenia. Metabolic crises need to be managed with a physician trained in the treatment of IEM, and all patients should be provided with an emergency protocol.

In this chapter, we outline the general principles of treatment for the 5 main categories of IEM: aminoacidopathies, urea cycle defects, organic acidemias, fatty acid oxidation disorders,

<a id='f177c5d7-36a8-4d38-bda9-5fa4c8180406'></a>

and disorders of carbohydrate metabolism. The tables provide a list of the most common IEM in each of these categories with general guidelines for chronic treatment.

**Aminoacidopathies**

Aminoacidopathies are a group of inherited genetic disorders involved in the metabolism of a specific amino acid(s). With a deficiency in an enzyme in an amino acid metabolic pathway, the offending amino acid, plus the amino acid's associated metabolite(s), accumulate in blood and various tissues. The manifestations of aminoacidopathies vary greatly with each disorder.2 For example, in untreated phenylketonuria (PKU) and homocystinuria, signs and symptoms develop gradually over time with prolonged exposure to the offending metabolites (Table 17-1). In contrast, maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) can present acutely prior to diagnosis, and patients remain at risk for metabolic decompensation during any illness or other catabolic event, even with a chronic treatment regimen (Table 17-1).

Example: MSUD

MSUD results from a deficiency of the branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase complex required for catabolism of the branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) leucine, valine and isoleucine, although leucine and its associated ketoacid (a-ketoisocaproic acid) are the primary toxic metabolites.7 MSUD is rare in the general population, but a founder variant in the Old-Order Mennonite results in a high incidence of approximately 1 in 350 live births in this population.8

<a id='c80d96a9-8ef2-4ffe-8b5c-3c436de1c995'></a>

Medical Nutrition Therapy Basics for MSUD

The goal of nutrition management for MSUD is to maintain near-normal leucine concentrations, prevent isoleucine and valine deficiency, and provide sufficient energy intake to allow for normal growth and development. Lifelong diet treatment can result in good cognitive and developmental outcomes, especially if illnesses and other catabolic events are aggressively managed. Especially for those with severe forms of this disorder, liver transplant prevents metabolic crises and allows for diet liberalization.7

<a id='80b235a9-d39d-4f67-873d-9ff39331faba'></a>

The nutrition treatment of MSUD includes the following⁹⁻¹¹:
1. Provide appropriate calories and fluid for age.
2. Restrict intact protein sources to limit intake of leucine to meet age-appropriate requirements, avoiding excessive or deficient intake (for infants younger than 6 months, leucine tolerance ranges from 40 to 100 mg/kg).
3. Provide a BCAA-free medical food (protein substitute without leucine, valine, and isoleucine [ie, MSUD Anamix Early Years, Nutricia North America]) to minimally meet the age-appropriate dietary reference intake (DRI) for protein.
4. Prevent isoleucine and/or valine deficiency by supplementing these amino acids, as needed.
5. Adjust nutrition plan based on leucine, valine, and isoleucine concentrations in plasma amino acid profiles to meet goal concentrations, listed next.

<a id='8eed4aee-6ea5-47d8-97fd-3463b7d1ff40'></a>

## Routine Monitoring for MSUD
Routine monitoring includes plasma amino acids (or BCAAs on dried blood spots)¹²:
* Treatment goals¹,³.
  * Leucine: 100–300 umol/L (100–200 umol/L in infants)
  * Isoleucine: 100–300 umol/L
  * Valine: 200–400 umol/L

<a id='a1e89b7d-57fd-459c-8d68-a3f5842c7975'></a>

## Acute Care for MSUD

During illness or other catabolic events, individuals are likely to require aggressive nutrition support.<sup>10,14</sup> Promoting protein anabolism is key to reducing leucine concentrations. Check BCAA concentrations in plasma amino acids every 12–24 hours to guide treatment adjustments.

1.  Provide optimal nonprotein caloric support.
    a.  Energy
        *   Individuals may require 1.5 to more than 2 times the estimated energy expenditure for age from enteral and/or parenteral sources.<sup>10</sup>
    b.  Dextrose
        *   Start with 10% dextrose (D10) intravenous (IV) fluids at an age-appropriate glucose infusion rate (GIR) but consider a higher concentration by central access to meet high caloric needs.
        *   Insulin may be needed in the presence of hyperglycemia to allow for adequate caloric support.<sup>14</sup>
    c.  Intralipids
        *   Initiate age-appropriate dosing with goal of 30%–50% of nonprotein sources from lipid.
    d.  Fluid
        *   Avoid excess fluid administration and hypotonic solutions, given the high risk for cerebral edema. Ensure normal serum osmolarity.
2.  Initiate a source of BCAA-free amino acids as soon as possible.
    a.  Hold leucine intake with elimination of intact protein sources until the leucine concentration is <300 µmol/L.
    b.  Initiate BCAA-free medical food by continuous nasogastric (NG) feeding to provide amino acids to promote protein anabolism.
        *   Goal: 2.0–3.5 g/kg for infants; it is greater than the DRI for all ages.<sup>10,14</sup>
    c.  Initiate addition of valine and isoleucine solutions (100 mg/mL) to the medical food to prevent deficiency of these amino acids. The goal concentration is >400 µmol/L in plasma amino acids for both.
    d.  Consider parenteral BCAA-free specialty amino acid solutions if the patient is unable to tolerate an enteral medical food. (See "Resources" section in this chapter.)
3.  When the leucine concentration has decreased (<300 µmol/L), reintroduce a source of leucine from a standard enteral formula or expressed breast milk for neonates.
    a.  Initiate enteral feeds (NG and/or oral) to provide leucine at approximately 25% of usual leucine tolerance.
        *   Continue isoleucine and valine supplements to ensure concentrations of both remain above 400 µmol/L as leucine is added.
    b.  Increase leucine intake based on tolerance and plasma leucine concentrations.
    c.  If enteral feeding is not possible, initiate a standard amino acid parenteral solution to provide leucine needs.
4.  Reduce parenteral fluids as enteral feeding increases to maintain adequate caloric intake.

_**Disorders of the Urea Cycle**_

Inborn errors of the urea cycle, called urea cycle disorders (UCDs), are a group of 8 disorders affecting the enzymes or transporters associated with the urea cycle with an overall incidence of 1 in 35,000 births¹⁵ (Table 17-2). Except in arginase deficiency, the hallmark of UCDs is hyperammonemia, which can be rapidly lethal in those with severe neonatal forms of these disorders. However, milder forms of these disorders can present at any age.¹⁶ Later-onset symptoms include cognitive delay, neurological/psychiatric symptoms, and chronic liver disease. Only argininosuccinic acid synthetase, argininosuccinic acid lyase, and arginase deficiencies can

<a id='500131f5-e273-4a48-95a8-84a2a5536aa5'></a>

be detected by NBS; thus, it is essential to include ammonia in the initial laboratory evaluations of critically ill infants. 15,17

<a id='649cadb2-6a54-471c-82a0-a91b4369c55f'></a>

Except in milder forms of these disorders, diet treatment is typically paired with medications, including nitrogen scavengers (ie, Ravicti, Hyperion Therapeutics) or enzyme cofactors (carglumic acid for N-acetylglutamate synthase [NAGS] deficiency; Carbalglu, Recordati Rare Diseases).¹⁵ The outcome of treatment varies depending on the severity of the enzyme defect and prevention of hyperammonemia with aggressive illness management. For those with severe forms of these disorders, early liver transplant is often indicated.¹⁸

<a id='07acbb30-8b7a-4d65-bc33-ab486d72f222'></a>

## Example: Ornithine Transcarbamylase Deficiency

The most common UCD is ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency. OTC deficiency can present in neonatal crisis or later in infancy or childhood, depending on the degree of enzyme deficiency. 15 Unlike the other UCDs, which are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, OTC is X-linked; female carriers may not be diagnosed until they have a child with this disorder or when experiencing severe catabolism, such as during delivery and the postpartum period. 19

<a id='66b63ca7-9300-4b1a-9d66-7d6ce06e8376'></a>

**Medical Nutrition Therapy Basics for OTC Deficiency**
The goal for nutrition management of OTC deficiency is to maintain normal ammonia and plasma amino acid levels with protein restriction while providing sufficient energy sources to promote normal growth and development. In OTC deficiency and other UCDs, total protein is

<a id='3d370626-bac9-41c6-92f6-3eb5337ce7a0'></a>

limited. This is different from many other IEM wherein total protein is not limited but is provided as medical food without the offending amino acid(s).20,21

The nutrition treatment for OTC deficiency includes the following20,21:

1.  Ensure adequate energy intake to prevent catabolism.
2.  Total protein restriction is typically at DRI for age or below.
3.  Protein composition includes essential amino acids (EAAs) and intact protein sources.
    a. Provide 30%-50% of total protein from a medical food providing only EAAs (ie, Cyclinex 1, Abbott Nutrition).
    b. The remainder of total protein will come from intact sources.
4.  Amino acid supplementation: In all UCDs except arginase deficiency, arginine becomes a conditionally EAA to replace arginine that is typically produced by the urea cycle.22
    a. In OTC deficiency, supplement with l-citrulline (100-200 mg/kg) to prevent arginine deficiency.
    b. See Table 17-2 for amino acid (L-arginine or L-citrulline) to supplement in other UCDs.
5.  Frequent monitoring of amino acid profiles is the primary marker for diet adjustments.

# Routine Monitoring for OTC

Routine monitoring for OTC includes the following:

1. Ammonia: Often only checked during acute situations, given the difficulty of laboratory draw and processing, which can lead to false elevations.²³
2. Amino acid profiles
   a. Glutamine: Primary marker to adjust protein prescription; can be elevated even without hyperammonemia.²⁴
   b. Arginine and citrulline are used to assess success of supplementation.
   c. BCAAs (leucine, valine, isoleucine) are used to assess the overall sufficiency of protein intake; BCAAs may be low with nitrogen scavenger medications.

**_Organic Acidemias_**
Organic acidemias (OAs) are a group of inherited genetic disorders involved in the degradation of BCAAs, methionine, and/or threonine with production of non-amino acid organic acids that cause disruption in normal metabolism (Table 17-3).2 Organic acids bind to carnitine (as acylcarnitine) and are detected in the blood and urine. Thus, supplemental L-carnitine is included

<a id='fe6ee9f8-8c24-4047-9ba2-4c7dbc43c693'></a>

in the treatment for OAs to avoid depletion of free carnitine stores.²⁷ OAs can present in a severe neonatal form; milder forms present during the first year or later.²⁸

**Example: Propionic Acidemia**
Oxidation of the propiogenic amino acids valine, methionine, isoleucine, and threonine results in the production of propionyl–coenzyme A (CoA) by the enzyme propionyl-CoA carboxylase. In

<a id='9b0a9f7a-7a50-4a2b-8227-e39a3a20b605'></a>

individuals with propionic acidemia (PROP), this enzyme deficiency results in the accumulation of propionyl-CoA and its metabolites, which inhibit the Krebs cycle and other pathways, resulting in a secondary energy deficit.29 In the United States, the incidence of PROP is thought to be 1 in 105,000–130,000 births.30

<a id='d30d9a9a-5b5e-46a6-b63a-c68e6ce9efb5'></a>

**Medical Nutrition Therapy Basics for PROP**

The goals for nutrition management of PROP include restricting the propiogenic amino acids to reduce production of toxic metabolites while providing adequate total protein and calories to allow for normal growth and development.27,31 The effectiveness of diet treatment varies with the severity of the disorder. Liver transplant is an option; however, complications can remain, and patients still require some protein restriction and L-carnitine supplementation.32

The nutrition treatment for PROP includes the following27,31:

<a id='b60c7d08-410c-4df8-b428-9a0eb62727a8'></a>

1. Provide age-appropriate calories and fluid depending on activity level.
2. Restrict intact protein to reduce intake of the propiogenic amino acids, without resulting in deficiencies.
   a. Intact protein goal intake is 60%-100% of DRI recommendations for age.
3. Provide a medical food (protein substitute without isoleucine, valine, methionine, and threonine [ie, MMA/PA Anamix Early Years, Nutricia North America]) if the patient's intact protein tolerance remains below total DRI requirements; the goal for total protein is 120% of DRI requirements.
4. L-carnitine supplementation: Provide L-carnitine to maintain free carnitine levels in the normal range; 50-100 mg/kg/d is often used as a starting dose.

<a id='ad3471d7-2162-4ace-81c5-b55fe7409fa1'></a>

# Routine Monitoring for PROP

Routine monitoring for PROP includes the following''':

1. Plasma amino acids:
   a. Maintain low normal concentrations of valine, methionine, isoleucine, and threonine; each laboratory will have its own normal range for various amino acids.
   b. Low BCAAs (leucine, valine, isoleucine) can suggest overrestriction of protein.
   c. Glycine will be elevated in all individuals with PROP.
2. Plasma carnitine profile (total, free, esterified fractions)
   a. Supplemental carnitine dose is adjusted to prevent deficient free carnitine.
3. Complete blood cell count and chemistry panela. Evaluate for neutropenia, metabolic acidosis, and liver impairment. These laboratory values are expected to be normal in a well state.
4. Ammonia
   a. Some individuals with PROP are prone to hyperammonemia. Goal is to maintain normal concentrations.''

<a id='c2321bd3-81e1-41a8-8113-f66ebc9c4079'></a>

## Acute Care for PROP
Management of an acutely ill individual with PROP or another OA focuses on promoting anabolism, detoxification, and other supportive treatments.<sup>27,33</sup> In less severe decompensation, providing dextrose (D10 IV fluids) at an age-appropriate GIR for 24–48 hours may be sufficient to allow the individual to start/resume their usual nutrition plan of care.

<a id='36edfff1-3ad7-4a4d-b384-44cb467641fe'></a>

If the individual remains acutely ill, escalation in nutrition support may be needed. Nutrition support guidelines for individuals with PROP are available.27,31 Individuals may require 110%–120% of usual energy needs using age-appropriate dextrose and intralipid recommendations.
Protein recommendations are as follows:27

<a id='f081f660-8906-4c93-a601-37de34287506'></a>

1. Restrict protein intake no longer that 24-48 hours, depending on clinical status.

<a id='45a527d2-77f6-4dd4-9947-347051558b99'></a>

2. Initiate or restart an enteral source of intact protein when ammonia, plasma amino acids, and other laboratory results indicate metabolic stability. Add a medical food to meet the total protein goal.
   a. Initial goal is 0.50 g/kg/d; increase by 0.25 g/kg/d, as tolerated.
3. If parenteral support is needed long term and protein goals cannot be met, consider a combination of a standard amino acid solution and specialty amino acid solutions without the propiogenic amino acids.

**_Disorders of Fatty Acid Oxidation_**

Fatty acid oxidation disorders (FAODs) are a group of inherited genetic disorders involved in the carnitine cycle for the transport of fatty acids across the mitochondrial membrane, β-oxidation, or ketone use (see Table 17-4).2,34 Prevention of extended fasting and attention during intercurrent illnesses or other catabolic events is essential for all FAODs. Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) is one of the most common metabolic disorders with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 13,000–19,000 in the United States.35 MCAD does not require a specific diet intervention. However, the long-chain FAODs (LC-FAODs) typically require restriction of long-chain fat (LCF) sources and supplementation of medium-chain triglyceride (MCTs).

### Example: Very-Long-Chain Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency

The very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase enzyme allows for oxidation of fatty acids of 10–20 carbons in length. Very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (VLCAD) has a wide spectrum of phenotypes. Those with severe VLCAD can present with cardiomyopathy in the neonatal period and are at risk for episodes of hypoketotic hypoglycemia with illness. Those with mild VLCAD can remain asymptomatic but may develop exercise intolerance with episodes of

<a id='7b894afe-94bf-48e8-9949-d5f60a2048e7'></a>

rhabdomyolysis in adolescence. Nutrition management for other disorders of long-chain fatty
acid metabolism is similar to that for VLCAD.36,37

<a id='26af76d5-02bf-41ef-8070-0f57bdeb21b3'></a>

**Medical Nutrition Therapy Basics for VLCAD**

The goals for nutrition management of VLCAD include providing fasting precautions and providing adequate calories for normal growth and development. LCF from diet sources is limited, and a source of MCTs is added to bypass the enzymes involved in β-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids. MCTs provide a source of fatty acids for continued β-oxidation and production of ketones. 36,37

<a id='8e1b937c-0c93-479d-8ebc-a1daf83ac238'></a>

The nutrition treatment for VLCAD includes the following³⁶,³⁷:

1.  Avoid extended fasting: Maximum 3–4 hours for those under 4 months of age; 8–10 hours above 1 year of age.³⁸
2.  Provide appropriate energy and fluid needs for age.
3.  Meet age-appropriate recommendations for total fat intake from dietary fat and MCT sources.
4.  Restrict intake of LCF from dietary sources, depending on age and disease severity.
    a. All sources of dietary fat can be counted as LCF and include triglycerides with unsaturated or saturated fatty acids of 10 or more carbons in length. The most common fatty acid found in food is palmitic acid (C16:0).
    b. Those with severe forms of VLCAD need to limit dietary fat to 10%–15% of total calories.
5.  Provide a source of MCTs.
    a. Choose a low-fat, MCT-supplemented medical food (ie, Enfaport, Mead Johnson). MCT oil or powder can be added to the diet after 1 year of age.
    b. MCT doses range from 10% to 45% of total kilocalories, or 2–3 g/kg in infants and 1.0–1.25 g/kg after the first year, depending on age and disease severity.
    c. Replacement of standard sources of MCTs with triheptanoin (Doljolvi, Ultragenyx Pharmaceuticals), an odd-chain fatty acid, may improve cardiac function and reduce metabolic crises, especially in those with severe forms of LC-FAOD.³⁹,⁴⁰
6.  Supplement with sources of essential fatty acids (EFAs) to maintain normal plasma concentrations, if needed.
7.  Higher protein intake may preserve lean body mass and reduce hepatic fat deposition.⁴¹
8.  Adjunct therapy
    a. L-carnitine: Supplementation may not be needed unless free carnitine is <10 umol/L. Starting dose recommendation is 1025 mg/kg/d.³⁷

<a id='8a7983e8-4c2f-4808-bf02-c5b4c4b9a843'></a>

# Routine Monitoring for VLCAD

Routine monitoring for VLCAD includes the following³⁶,³⁷:

1.  Creatine kinase
    a. Elevations suggest muscle injury and possible rhabdomyolysis. Normal or mild elevations can be seen in individuals with VLCAD in a well state.
2.  Plasma carnitine profile (total, free, esterified)
    a. Maintain plasma-free carnitine at above 10 umol/L.
3.  Chemistry panel
    a. Evaluate for hypoglycemia and liver impairment.
    b. In a well state, normoglycemia is expected. Individuals with VLCAD can have mild elevations in liver enzymes.
4.  EFA profile
    a. Normal concentrations of linolenic acid, α-linolenic acid, arachidonic acid, docosahexaenoic acid and ratios (ie, Holman ratio) should be maintained.
5.  Troponin and brain natriuretic peptide should be used to evaluate cardiac status. Elevations can be seen in a compromised cardiac state.

<a id='93ae2631-8930-4dca-be74-1632ec176f87'></a>

**Acute Care for VLCAD**

The management of an acutely ill individual with a LC-FAOD focuses on promoting anabolism, maintaining blood glucose, addressing rhabdomyolysis, and other supportive treatments.

<a id='0c5a0948-7060-49b6-beeb-207c22292284'></a>

Providing dextrose (D10 IV fluids) at an age-appropriate GIR for 24-48 hours may be sufficient to allow the individual to start/resume their usual nutrition plan of care. If the individual remains acutely ill, escalation in nutrition support may be needed. Individuals with VLCAD can be prescribed age-appropriate recommendations for energy, dextrose, protein, and micronutrients.

<a id='4bd18f94-1bf2-446c-a8e1-75a4d6bded56'></a>

Recommendations for IV lipids include the following$^{36,37}$:
1. Initially hold IV lipid sources because of the inability to use long-chain fatty acids.
2. Provide an IV lipid source for EFAs if there is a prolonged nothing-by-mouth status.
   a. Infants: Add by day 7.
   b. Adults: Add by day 10.
   c. SMOFlipid (Fresenius Kabi) may be beneficial because of its MCT content.
3. Initiate or resume enteral feedings following usual age-appropriate guidelines.

_**Inborn Errors of Carbohydrate Metabolism**_

Disorders of enzyme deficiencies in the metabolism of glucose, fructose, and galactose include hereditary fructose intolerance and galactosemia (Table 17-5).42,43 Glycogen storage diseases (GSDs) result from deficiency of enzymes involved in the synthesis or use of glycogen primarily in hepatic and/or muscle tissue, although other tissues such as heart or brain tissues can be involved.44,45 GSDs involving the liver often present with hypoglycemia, hepatomegaly, hyperlipidemia, and lactic acidosis.44,46 Those involving muscle present with muscle wasting, hypotonia, and/or rhabdomyolysis.44,47

Example: GSD, Type I (Von Gierke Disease)

<a id='92f499e8-1224-4689-bfe2-589e99bf301e'></a>

GSD I is the most common of the GSDs with a prevalence of 1 in 100,000 live births.48 In GSD I, a deficiency of the hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase complex can result in severe hypoglycemia because the enzyme complex is involved in both glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. There are 2 subtypes: (1) GSD Ia, which involves deficiency of glucose-6-phosphatase, and (2) GSD Ib, which involves deficiency of the glucose-6-phosphate transporter. GSD Ib has the same characteristics as GSD Ia but with the addition of neutropenia, increasing the risk of recurrent infections and chronic inflammatory bowel disease. Without sufficient glucose-6-phosphatase activity, fructose and galactose cannot be converted to glucose-6-phosphate, therefore, limiting fruit (fructose), sugar (sucrose), and dairy products (lactose) is recommended.49,50

<a id='4b9e829b-652b-4348-b4a7-aec3bd05536b'></a>

## Medical Nutrition Therapy Basics for GSD Ia and Ib

The goals for nutrition management of GSD Ia and Ib is to maintain normoglycemia (>70 mg/dL) by preventing excessive fasting and supplementing with uncooked cornstarch (UCCS) as a slow-release source of glucose. Avoiding excessive intake of fructose and galactose is necessary because both contribute to glycogen synthesis. 49,50 Poor metabolic control can contribute to development of hepatic adenomas, renal failure, gout, and inadequate bone density.

1.  Avoid excessive fasting.
    a. Fasting should be 2–3 hours maximum in infants and 4–6 hours maximum in adults.
    b. Evaluate blood glucose frequently to guide fasting tolerance.
    c. Gastrostomy feeding with a nighttime drip is often required to avoid hypoglycemia in younger patients.
        * Use a sucrose-free, soy-based formula for infants or a high-carbohydrate elemental formula for older individuals.
2.  Carbohydrates (60%–70% of total energy)
    a. Emphasize complex sources; avoid simple sugar sources.
    b. Limit fructose to 2.5 g per meal, and limit dairy to 1 serving per day.
    c. UCCS can be used to provide a slow-release source of glucose.
        * Initiate in infants over 9–12 months of age because insufficient pancreatic amylase enzyme activity exists for digestion of UCCS before this age.
        * Initiate UCCS with 1 g per dose, increasing by 1 g per dose each week until the optimal dose is achieved.
        * Mix in formula or cold water, and do not heat or add to acidic foods; 1 g of UCCS mixes in 2–3 mL of fluid.
        * UCCS needs vary with age, weight, and fasting tolerance. 50,51 Use the Bier equation to determine the ideal carbohydrate dose for each feeding (includes formula + UCCS) for children under 8 years of age and weighing <30 kg:

<a id='fabe1ad4-56ff-440b-8ae5-77f71e84781d'></a>

Y = 0.0014X³ - 0.214X² + 10.411X – 9.084
Y = mg/glucose/min and X = weight in kg

<a id='ba5e0775-8a51-44c9-85be-7dd37500d1bc'></a>

- 1 g UCCS provides 0.9 g glucose. UCCS is typically divided into 4–8 doses per day and adjusted based on blood glucose monitoring.
d. Glycosade (Vitaflo USA) (55 g of UCCS = 60 g Glycosade) is a high-amylopectin cornstarch that may extend overnight fasting tolerance in those over 5 years of age. Efficacy is greater for those with GSD Ia than for those with GSD Ib.⁵²,⁵³
3. Lean protein (10%–15% of total energy)
4. Low fat (<30% of total energy)
5. Micronutrient supplementation: Complete vitamin and mineral, calcium, and vitamin D supplementation is needed because of dietary restrictions.

## Routine Monitoring for GSD Ia and Ib
Routine monitoring for GSD Ia and Ib includes the following$^{49,50}$:
1. Blood glucose: avoid hypoglycemia (Goal >70 mg/dL)

<a id='b4a53d76-599f-441c-a84e-a74198c70e40'></a>

a. Frequent monitoring of blood glucose is required.
b. Consider a continuous glucose monitor to assess blood glucose trends. 54
2. Other laboratory tests include lactic acid, lipid panel, uric acid, liver transaminases, and renal function. Individuals under good metabolic control can maintain levels in the normal range; however, elevations in some of these laboratory markers will remain.

<a id='9af0db2a-a841-40bf-85f2-21f5a2ebd631'></a>

### Acute Care for GSD Ia and Ib
Management of an acutely ill individual with GSD type I focuses on preventing hypoglycemia and minimizing lactic acidemia.<sup>49,50</sup> Providing dextrose (D10 IV fluids) at an age-appropriate GIR for 24–48 hours when ill may be sufficient to allow the individual to start/resume their usual nutrition plan of care.

<a id='aa95542c-2e4d-4e3b-aba5-c1a555cfcfed'></a>

For individuals that are unable to resume UCCS regimen and oral diet after several days, additional nutrition support may be needed. Follow age-appropriate guidelines for energy, dextrose, protein, lipids, and micronutrients. When resuming UCCS therapy,
1. Begin with 25%-50% of usual cornstarch doses and advance toward the goal.
2. Taper IV support as UCCS is increased and tolerated and maintain blood glucose above 70 mg/dL.

# Introduction

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by inflammation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and can involve the entire tract from the mouth to anus. It consists of Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), and indeterminate colitis; UC affects only the colon, but CD can affect the entire GI tract. The disease results from a complex interplay of genetic, immune, and environmental factors. Diet may contribute to the pathophysiology and is suspected to be a risk factor, thus the interest in nutrition therapies for CD. However, the use of nutrition therapy in UC is not supported by data. Inflammation of the GI tract often leads to malabsorption and poor oral intake. Children with IBD, and especially CD, are at risk of growth failure and malnutrition. Prevention of malnutrition, micronutrient deficiencies, and promoting optimal growth and development is important. In this chapter, we will review the nutrition therapies in CD and optimal nutrition strategies to prevent micronutrient deficiencies and malnutrition.

Assessment and Nutrient Requirements

<a id='1253d1af-7209-408c-91f7-9584a3f94624'></a>

Children with IBD are at increased risk for nutrient losses during times of active disease from diarrhea, vomiting, and decreased appetite. In addition, chronic inflammation associated with IBD and medications such as steroids may impact their growth. For these reasons, a detailed nutrition assessment is critical:
* History: Nausea, vomiting, appetite, and dietary recall of 3–5 days
* Nutrition-focused physical examination
* Anthropometric data: Weight, height, body mass index, height velocity
* Laboratory assessment: Iron studies (ferritin, total iron binding capacity, transferrin saturation, serum iron), a complete blood cell count, and vitamin D levels should be measured annually. Additional laboratory assessment may be needed in select patients (Table 18-1).

**Nutrition Therapies for Crohn's Disease**
The mainstays of nutrition therapy for patients with CD include exclusive enteral nutrition, which can promote mucosal healing in active luminal CD. It is used as first-line induction therapy as an alternative to anti-inflammatory medications.1-3 Other nutrition therapies for CD include partial enteral nutrition (PEN) and CD exclusion diet (CDED). CDED + PEN can be considered for induction by 6 weeks and maintenance of remission at 12 weeks (see Table 18-2).1-3

**Prevention of Malnutrition**
Children with poor energy stores and active inflammation require 5%–
35% more energy than healthy children. Patients with active
inflammation or infection, and patients who are recovering from surgery
require higher protein intake than healthy children. If oral nutrition is
inadequate, enteral nutrition (EN) may be recommended, and if EN is not
feasible, parenteral nutrition may be required.4

**Prevention of Vitamin and Micronutrient Deficiency**
Vitamin D, iron, and zinc deficiencies most commonly occur in children with IBD (Table 18-1). To prevent deficiency, patients with IBD need careful monitoring and supplementation as needed.4,5

# Introduction

The primary causes of pediatric renal disease differ greatly from adult disease. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined by the "Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes Guidelines" as abnormalities of the kidney structure or function or by decline in glomerular filtration rate below 60 mL/min/1.73 m², present for more than 3 months, which has been categorized via a continuum of stages (see Table 19-1).¹ About 50% of pediatric CKD is related to structural abnormalities at birth known as congenital anomalies of the urinary tract, which often affects males more than females, with the most common diagnoses being congenital obstructive uropathy and aplastic, hypoplastic, or dysplastic kidneys. Functional abnormalities can encompass glomerular diseases, with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis being a common diagnosis of children with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). With less than 2% of the ESRD population being pediatric, the population is small, but the nutrition challenges are profound and complex.²

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is an abrupt decrease in kidney function with rise in serum creatinine or decrease in urine output. Etiologies of AKI are often categorized as prerenal, intrinsic, and postrenal, with the resolution of etiology aiming to improve and reverse kidney dysfunction.² Nutrition interventions depend on the degree and length of kidney dysfunction, often using staging of CKD (although temporary) and intensive care fundamentals.

<a id='e335930f-4d56-43ce-b5a0-befde4bc4679'></a>

Nephrotic syndrome is a combination of symptoms including
proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia, anasarca, and oliguria.2
Nephrotic syndrome can be idiopathic or congenital, with idiopathic renal
diseases being most common; specifically, minimal change disease
accounts for about 80% of nephrotic syndrome cases in childhood.3
Nutrition interventions such as decreasing sodium and fluid intake along
with pharmacologic care are imperative to medical management of
nephrotic syndrome.

Nephrolithiasis, or calculi within the urinary tract, also known as
kidney stones, can have significant nutrition modifications for preventing
recurrence of stone formation. Although some have genetic or familial
origins such as primary hyperoxaluria, much of pediatric kidney stone
formation is related to lifestyle habits, environment, and diet. Increased

<a id='94b61140-5410-45ca-ae98-afb4affdd4d4'></a>

risk factors for kidney stones include obesity, hypertension, living in a warm climate, and secondary diagnoses such as short bowel syndrome and Crohn's disease. More than 50% of kidney stones contain calcium and oxalate, with many children exhibiting hypercalciuria and hypocitraturia.2 Eliminating risk factors for stone formation through diet (see Table 19-2) and lifestyle is strongly recommended.

*Renal Replacement Therapy*
**Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy**
Continuous renal replacement therapy is continuous or nearly continuous fluid and/or solute removal, with multiple methods of therapy depending on the needs of a critically ill patient to replace kidney function.

<a id='47bc72b9-3e91-435e-8629-19d9aff902dd'></a>

# Hemodialysis

Hemodialysis (HD) or intermittent HD is fluid and/or solute removal from blood via a central venous catheter or surgically constructed arteriovenous fistula using passive diffusion with a semipermeable membrane. Pediatric HD treatments are often 3–4 hours 3–5 times per week, most often in a dialysis center depending on the child's size, fluid status, metabolic abnormalities, and tolerance.²

<a id='4d7ff599-d9dc-48ca-bf88-a01a178507e2'></a>

# Peritoneal Dialysis

Peritoneal dialysis is fluid and solute removal via a surgically placed catheter into peritoneal cavity using passive diffusion with the peritoneal membrane. Therapy is typically 10–12 hours nightly, with dialysate fluid being infused and drained (a cycle) often using an automated cycler machine in pediatrics.² Dialysate solutions contain various degrees of dextrose (1.5%, 2.5%, or 4.25%), sodium, chloride, magnesium, calcium, and lactate to create gradients for diffusion.

<a id='7b6d37d2-6375-4702-92cd-b5a7a53c69d9'></a>

## Transplant
Solid organ transplant of a living or deceased donor kidney can be preemptive or for children with ESRD on dialysis if the patient meets criteria as a surgical candidate by the transplant team. Children often need to be around 10 kg or more to be eligible to proceed with transplant because of the size constraints of receiving an adult kidney.

# Assessment and Nutrient Requirements

## Assessment and Growth

Poor weight gain and linear growth continue to be the most challenging and recognizable adverse events and can result in decline of quality of life and risk of hospitalization and mortality for pediatric CKD.² Reasons for this decline can be decreased nutrition intake, hormonal abnormalities affecting appetite, urinary or dialysis losses of nutrients, renal

<a id='9d9d54c7-7dfa-48a7-803f-4f7fb21d121c'></a>

osteodystrophy, acidosis, uremia, growth hormone abnormalities,
prematurity, steroid use, and inflammation.² Obtaining and monitoring
anthropometrics are extremely important in this population.⁴

<a id='1633f90a-b22b-4ef7-ac7e-9428a8b17346'></a>

**Euvolemic Weight**
Determine the weight at which the child is neither fluid overloaded nor
dehydrated, which can be based on physical examination, vital signs, and
symptoms. See chapter 1, “Nutrition Screening and History,” for
nutrition-focused physical examination. Use euvolemic or “dry” weight
for nutrition calculations and growth monitoring. 2,4

<a id='f2322284-a920-4a42-88c9-031bed91b89f'></a>

**Body Mass Index and Body Composition**

Children can have decreased lean mass with higher adiposity. Because of short stature, the body mass index (BMI) of individuals that fall below the third percentile for height may overestimate the prevalence of underweight and lean body mass. It is recommended to adjust BMI for age using the height age of the child, for which the child's height would be at the fiftieth percentile, to better estimate lean mass and adiposity. However, once the child has reached adult height, this method is no longer appropriate.4

<a id='089831c2-4007-42b0-b65e-49f0bb72cdb2'></a>

**Estimating Needs**

Despite poor weight gain and linear growth, estimating energy needs in
pediatric kidney disease should be based on age-appropriate calculations
and methods. Patients with nephrotic syndrome, progressing CKD, and
receiving renal replacement therapies may require adjustments of energy
and protein intakes to achieve goal weight gain, growth, and serum levels
as listed in Table 19-3.

### Electrolytes and Micronutrients

Electrolyte and micronutrient intake in pediatric kidney disease continue to be the most challenging to manage because patients require individualized prescriptions that must be monitored and adjusted based on laboratory values, age, growth, and degree of kidney function.

<a id='60f54683-f190-43cb-a97c-ef0fbbfc4967'></a>

Micronutrient considerations are listed in Table 19-4, including restrictions, monitoring, and rationale for concern. See also Table 19-5.
