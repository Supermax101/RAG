Plotting under the 20th percentile for weight for age on the CP growth charts places children in the “zone of concern,” which is demarcated on the charts. Plotting in this region places children at increased risk of morbidity and mortality based on their nutrition status alone. Plotting _above_ the zone of concern does not mean the child's nutrition has been optimized; it simply reflects how they plot with respect to other children similarly affected by motor impairment. Despite their limitations, these growth charts are valuable tools for discussions regarding nutrition rehabilitation with families and the possible need for a significant change in their child's nutrition care plan.38

**Interpreting Patterns of Growth**

The following scenarios trigger a deeper look into a child's nutrition and general health status:

* sharp inclines or declines in weight gain or growth,
* plateau of weight or growth percentiles or z scores, and/or
* unexpected movement downward from a previously established growth pattern on weight or growth percentiles or z scores.

<a id='eccad107-600a-4256-88fc-d0a28f4ae42c'></a>

Investigation of changes in weight and height should occur before a child has crossed 2 percentiles on a growth chart or has experienced a decline in BMI-for-age z score or weight for length for age z score of 2. In the first 2–3 years of life, children may cross percentiles as they are finding their own growth trajectory.39

<a id='9357e21c-99c6-4d44-b2d6-a911f778d5c0'></a>

Use of z Scores (SDs vs Percentiles)

<a id='573b3ab0-a5ad-4fdd-80bf-4e8135ba02e5'></a>

Percentiles are commonly used and indicate the child's position within the context of the reference population (ie, when measurements are within the third and 97th percentiles [2 SDs]). Percentiles indicate what percentage of the population will be less than or greater than the individual being compared with the reference standard. This is a descriptive standard.

<a id='37200ec7-1034-4510-9861-057e074a8792'></a>

Values expressed as z scores describe how far, in SDs or SD units, the child's measurement is from the mean (average). Values expressed as z scores are more precise in describing anthropometric status than percentiles, as they compare actual numbers (vs percentiles).

<a id='6a795a30-2396-40bd-8c18-1e74fdbf90f0'></a>

The use of z scores is beneficial when the child plots far from the expected growth percentiles on a standard growth chart. Changes in weight gain or growth may be seen more clearly when they are expressed as z scores instead of percentiles. A z score <-2 SDs indicates a growth pattern of concern requiring close monitoring and investigation.

Table 1-11 shows percentiles from set 1 of the WHO child growth standards and the corresponding z score. This references percentiles that closely correspond to z score cutoff points that define pediatric malnutrition. 18,34

<a id='50bfc44a-acbf-4c5c-8a54-005c6b921e94'></a>

*Nutrition-Focused Physical Examination*
The nutrition-focused physical examination (NFPE) is an important part of the overall nutrition assessment of the child. It is the subjective assessment by the nutrition provider of the presence of malnutrition in children. The techniques of inspection and palpation are used to identify both macronutrient and micronutrient deficiency.

<a id='ad6867a1-2934-459c-8232-c0c9249872b5'></a>

The clinical signs of malnutrition due to potential nutrient deficiency and the clinical data that support these physical findings can be assessed through a thorough hands-on examination of the child. Table 1-12 provides details on NFPE clinical signs of potential nutrient deficiency, physical signs of those deficiencies, and potential clinical support data. 23,40,41

Using a checklist format (as shown in Table 1-13) when performing a NFPE allows the practitioner to select signs and symptoms present during the examination, for further consideration following the exam.42,43 These indicators of malnutrition can then be recorded in the medical record to support the diagnosis.

# Assessments of Muscle Wasting and Strength

Malnourished children can have muscle wasting, fatigue, and decreased muscle strength. 44–46 This change in functional status can be measured by handgrip strength which is a good indicator of overall muscle strength.47 However, the handgrip strength test can be more difficult to perform and interpret in children than in adults, in whom it is more studied. Because considerable cooperation is required, young children and those with neurodevelopmental challenges may have trouble with performance and cooperation. Figure 1-5 demonstrates the technique for using a handgrip dynamometer.41

A 6-minute walk test measures how far an individual can walk in 6 minutes. It has broad applications in assessing pulmonary function in children with chronic cardiorespiratory illness (eg, cystic fibrosis, congenital heart lesions, or pulmonary hypertension) and in endurance in children with neuromuscular conditions like CP, spinal muscular atrophy, and muscular dystrophies. It is thought to reflect capabilities in the activities of daily living. However, reference levels for interpretation of the 6-minute walk test vary widely, and its use as a nutrition indicator is not validated, which makes interpretation challenging.48

<a id='bae5b090-9a7a-40a6-935b-76ebe8b92379'></a>

If children are undergoing regular 6-minute walk tests for other reasons, the results could be used in conjunction with other nutrition data to assess changes in muscle function and strength, which can be an important indicator of nutrition status. (See "Subjective Global Nutrition Assessment" section in this chapter.) It may be difficult to tease out whether cardiopulmonary function, primary muscle dysfunction, or nutrition status was the cause of a change in distance walked in a 6-minute walk test.

## Assessments of Fluid Status

Fluid status and hydration in children should be assessed as part of the overall nutrition assessment. In general, fluid intake and fluid output should be in balance. Decreased intake or increased losses can lead to dehydration, just as increased intake and/or decreased output can lead to fluid retention and overhydration. Table 1-14 provides information that can be used to assess hydration status in children.49

_**Subjective Global Nutrition Assessment**_

The Subjective Global Nutrition Assessment (SGNA) is an assessment tool that has been validated for the assessment and diagnosis of malnutrition in the pediatric population including children with developmental differences and growth rates.50-52 This tool can be used to assess for the presence of malnutrition and is often used as the reference standard against which other tools are validated. Table 1-15 shows all the assessment components of the SGNA to identify normal nutrition status or moderate or severe variation in the expected nutrition status for age.

# Laboratory Evaluation

Laboratory evaluation of nutrition-related factors depends on the child's cooccurring medical conditions, their nutrition status, and the route of intake. There is no single indicator that can be used to determine nutrition status. Prealbumin and albumin were traditionally used as such markers; however, they are not useful nutrition indicators but instead are more important markers of inflammation.53 The NFPE or the SGNA may help point the way to laboratory evaluation based on the targeted history and clinical signs that it encompasses. Although there is some debate about whether children on stable enteral nutrition require regular laboratory evaluation, Romano et al suggest that for children with NI, assessment of their blood counts, iron status, zinc, and bone health status (vitamin D, calcium, and phosphate) is warranted.54 (See chapter 13, "Neurological Impairment and Developmental Disabilities.") They also note that in children with NI, micronutrient status may need to be monitored because of restrictions in dietary intake.

The same applies for all children with limited dietary repertoires. Deficiencies in iron (especially if vitamin C intake is limited), zinc, copper, calcium, phosphorus, carnitine, folic acid, vitamin B12 (when using anticonvulsant medications), and vitamin D (if there is limited sunlight exposure) all need to be considered.52

**Summary of Nutrition Assessment**

All children should be screened for nutrition risk in all settings, including inpatient (acute care), outpatient (ambulatory care), and community care settings. Simple pediatric nutrition risk screening tools are available that can be used in all settings. These can be administered by trained staff or by caregivers under the instruction of trained staff. A thorough nutrition assessment that is a follow-up to a positive score on a nutrition risk screen has been shown to lead to improved delivery of care for pediatric patients.

The assessment of nutrition status that includes all the information from the
dietary and medical history, serial anthropometric measurements, NFPE, and
laboratory data should be used to diagnose the nutrition problem(s) present. These
data should be compared with accepted reference standards or established goals for

<a id='0d3bb029-29e7-447c-9ccc-e7bf6ea24efc'></a>

the child. This information should be documented and communicated to the medical team to ensure that appropriate treatment, coding, and billing are provided for the care of the child. Once a nutrition plan is developed, the process continues with monitoring, reassessment, and adjusting of the plan as needed to ensure appropriate growth and wellbeing for the child.

# Malnutrition in Children

In the assessment for malnutrition in children, it is beneficial to use established standards to identify and diagnose the presence of the condition and to document its severity. In the United States, the most commonly used set of criteria for malnutrition are the Pediatric Academy of Nutrition and Dietetic and ASPEN consensus-derived "Indicators of Malnutrition" (pAAIM).¹ Table 2-1 provides the pAAIM and the billing codes associated with the various indicators and gradations of malnutrition. ¹,² When assessing a child for malnutrition using the pAAIM, it is recommended to include all the indicators in the assessment for which information or data for the child is available. A thorough nutrition assessment helps ensure accurate identification of the cause and acuity of malnutrition. Table 2-2 identifies the age-based criteria for children.¹

Weight gain velocity assessment for malnutrition is based on an average daily or monthly weight gain required children to remain stable on the growth curve. These rates are determined by the trajectory of the growth curve, and they vary by age. The reference standard for ages 1 month to 24 months are the World Health Organization (WHO) velocity standards for weight. They are presented as a 1-month increment

table from birth to 12 months, and as 2- to 6-month increment tables from
birth to 24 months. The calculation of weight gain velocity percentage of
normal is based on the WHO weight gain velocity 1- to 2-month interval

Children identified with severe acute malnutrition by a low MUAC (<115 mm) and those identified by a low WHZ (z score < -3) have a similar mortality hazard, which is about 4 times higher than those without an anthropometric deficit. Having a low MUAC and a low WHZ was associated with an 8 times higher hazard of dying compared with children within the normal range.4,5

_**Coding and Billing for Malnutrition**_

<a id='3ceeaf2d-5645-44b7-97c2-aca920f09d50'></a>

The use of terms such as “failure to thrive” (FTT) to diagnose growth failure are less beneficial in documenting and communicating information regarding the child's nutrition state. FTT is a nonspecific, poorly defined term used to describe poor growth or the inability to maintain growth, usually in early childhood. It lacks the descriptive information required to diagnose malnutrition.¹

<a id='ccbab8ce-51cd-4c86-91da-1fb530d4dcae'></a>

"Malnutrition Matters: A Call to Action for Providers Caring for Pediatric Patients” provides information on documentation, coding, and reimbursement for malnutrition. It states that early recognition and intervention can reduce length of hospital stay and readmission, and that accurate coding improves reimbursement for the costs of care. 7-10

Inflammation related to malnutrition leads to adverse outcomes through poor appetite and decreased food intake. It causes increased energy expenditure and increased muscle catabolism. It can lead to derangements of micronutrient function of vitamin D, iron, and zinc. Inflammation interferes with a child's response to nutrition interventions and may render medical therapies less effective.11 For children, inflammation also affects growth. It suppresses hepatic production of insulin-like growth factor and causes growth factor resistance at the growth plate.12 Being aware of the presence of inflammation in the assessment, identification, and treatment of malnutrition in children is a critical part of the nutrition plan of care. Biochemical markers of inflammation in pediatric patients are described in Table 2-5.1,10,13

# Malnutrition in Preterm Infants and Neonates

Malnutrition in the preterm infant and neonate can have a lifelong negative impact. The data used to assess the presence of malnutrition of the preterm infant or neonate are like those used for the pediatric population. Evaluations of nutrient intake, anthropometric measurements, and growth velocity are used to determine if an infant is malnourished. The 2013 Fenton preterm growth chart¹⁴ or the 2010 Olsen intrauterine growth curves¹⁵ are the reference standards and should be used for infants born earlier than 37 weeks' gestation (both are available at https://www.peditools.org). The WHO child growth standards should be used for infants born at 37 0/7 weeks' gestation and older.¹⁶

<a id='4c1c7c43-33c4-4a47-83af-9b1b2eb49000'></a>

Growth assessment begins at birth by identifying whether an infant is small for gestational age (SGA), appropriate for gestational age (AGA), or large for gestational age, or has experienced intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). SGA is defined as a z score below -1.25 (less than the 10th percentile) for gestational age, AGA is a z score between -1.25 and 1.25 (10th to 90th percentile). IUGR is defined as a pathological process that causes weight to be less than the genetically predicted weight. IUGR is diagnosed by intrauterine growth failure with normal head circumference.17,18

Criteria for the diagnosis of preterm and neonatal infant malnutrition were suggested in an article published in 2018$^{16}$ and are used for this population in the neonatal intensive care unit setting. Two sets of malnutrition indicators are available:

1. Those that require only a _single indicator_ for diagnoses:

<a id='16d2e8a2-74e9-463c-8fcf-e3081ee0e97c'></a>

a. "Adequacy of nutrient intake": preferred indicator for diagnosing malnutrition in the first 2 weeks of life
b. Decline in weight-for-age z score and weight gain velocity lower than expected

<a id='7b6c70de-1863-4a3f-9311-ca13def19064'></a>

2. Those that require 2 *indicators* for diagnosis of malnutrition in preterm infants and neonates:
    a. Number of days to regain birth weight
    b. Length gain velocity
    c. Decline in length-for-age z score.

<a id='44fdca2c-99d1-4c3c-9608-c845221fa7cc'></a>

In general, these indicators are used in combination with inadequate nutrient (energy and/or protein) intake as outlined in Table 2-6.16

# Regain of Birth Weight

Most infants, both term and preterm, demonstrate an initial postnatal weight loss. This usually results in a loss of 7%-10% of birth weight during the first few days of life. It is generally expected that infants will regain birth weight by 7-14 days of age.19 When used in conjunction with adequacy of nutrient intake, the length of time required for the infant to regain birth weight, when longer than usual, suggests malnutrition, as delineated in the preterm/neonatal criteria.

<a id='a6e7b691-7686-4c97-b83b-b684735864e1'></a>

### Weight Gain Velocity

The growth goal for the infant to maintain a weight gain velocity that will allow them to improve or maintain stability of their weight-for-age z score ranges from 15–30 g per day.²⁰ As with older children, weight gain velocity that is less than the weight gain needed to maintain stable growth is an indicator of malnutrition.²¹

The rate of weight gain velocity needed to maintain a stable weight-for-age z score varies with weight, age, and sex; therefore, weight gain velocity goals are adjusted frequently. Weight gain goals can be established using preterm growth charts or a preterm growth calculator program or application such as PediTools (https://www.peditools.org).

<a id='cd63c487-c7f9-49af-b8c7-4246076aa352'></a>

**Change in Weight-for-Age z Score**

Faltering growth as indicated by a decline in weight-for-age z score is one of the recommended indicators for the identification of malnutrition in the preterm/neonatal population. The indicator for decline in weight-for-age z score is based on a large, international, longitudinal, observational study that reported infants with uncomplicated postnatal adaptation transitioned to a weight gain trajectory 0.8 SD below birth at day of life 21. The cutoffs for mild, moderate, and severe malnutrition also reflect the expected rate of weight gain of preterm infants and

<a id='f10c0fae-7303-4f30-80a3-99044be5f9af'></a>

neonates.²² Rates of weight gain vary depending on the infant and need to be calculated based on growth charts, weight gain velocity charts, or using a growth calculator such as PediTools.

<a id='32daf8bd-1510-4e43-be97-95b80d0aee3c'></a>

# Length

The indicators related to length include less-than-expected linear growth velocity and decline in length-for-age z score. Linear growth is dependent on fat-free mass accretion and adequate protein and micronutrient intake. Therefore, it is recommended that the indicators related to linear growth be used in conjunction with nutrient intake in the identification of malnutrition.²³

<a id='3bb1403c-7f5a-4535-bdf7-fc26c105f43b'></a>

The publication "Applying the Recommended Indicators for the Diagnosis of Preterm and Neonatal Malnutrition: Answers to Frequently Asked Questions" offers some additional guidance for the use of the indicators.24 There are a few simple steps to follow to diagnose malnutrition in an infant:22

1.  Determine which set of criteria to use to diagnose the infant.
    a. Is the infant preterm—is the infant term and less than 30 days old?
        *   Use the preterm/neonatal indicators.
    b. Is the infant a term baby and/or are they 1 month of age or older?
        *   Use the pediatric criteria.
2.  Assess all criteria for which data are available.
    a. Preterm-neonatal criteria
    b. Pediatric criteria for 1–24 months of age
3.  Select the criteria with the highest acuity/severity on which to base the diagnosis.
    a. Mild vs moderate vs severe malnutrition
4.  Document the diagnosis and the assessment on which the diagnosis is based.
    a. State the diagnosis, the criteria, and the severity
5.  Communicate the diagnosis and treatment to the medical provider responsible for the care of the child.

# Developmental Feeding Stages

As part of the nutrition assessment, noting the child's achievement of their developmental milestones related to feeding skills is an essential part of the process. This information will help the provider in developing an appropriate treatment plan for the child. Table 3-1 outlines important features of feeding development and transitions to age-appropriate foods.1-4 Useful guidance on breastfeeding can be found in the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Policy statement, "Breastfeeding and the Use of Human Milk."5

Feeding, Eating, and Drinking Difficulties, Including Swallowing Problems (Dysphagia)

<a id='bf374a1d-91e0-495f-9615-cbe3db170945'></a>

Feeding oneself or feeding someone else involves more than just swallowing. Food is imbued with a tangle of emotions and meaning for all of us. It is how we celebrate, relate, and communicate and how we learn about our cultures. For infants, the most important developmental task is learning how to eat because it lies at the heart of communication.

<a id='9d65ee51-70b6-4ce4-b021-0b49ac704b17'></a>

The same holds true for children with feeding, eating, and drinking difficulties. They and their families want the same shared sensory and social experiences, although these may be more difficult to achieve. Because of the broad range of challenges with food consumption, the help of a multidisciplinary team in the assessment of feeding, eating, and drinking difficulties is invaluable.

<a id='11195494-0b22-471f-93e9-e06f9d3e653e'></a>

Dysphagia is difficulty swallowing. It has different connotations for different people; hence, we will refer to “feeding, eating, and drinking difficulties” because the phrase is more inclusive of some of the ancillary problems associated with eating. “Penetration” means that swallowed material enters the upper airway but does not pass below the vocal cords, whereas “aspiration” means that food or liquid has passed below the vocal cords when a child swallows. Aspiration can occur before, during, or after swallowing, as well as from gastroesophageal reflux (GER).

<a id='7d063c45-9277-497b-83a3-6e34b5799a5c'></a>

_**Three Phases of Swallowing**_

The process of swallowing is usually divided into three phases: oral, pharyngeal, and esophageal phases, all of which can be impacted by anatomic or physiologic variation, thereby impacting food intake.2 Although reflexively driven in early infancy, as the oral phase matures, it is voluntary. Once it is volitional, food is to be put closer to the front of the mouth for more manipulation of texture.

<a id='cc03bddf-8b1b-4aed-af36-0f7747b9ee46'></a>

Once triggered, the pharyngeal phase is involuntary. It involves the following:

* Moving food or liquid through the pharynx
* Automatic closures of the
  * Nasopharynx with the uvula and soft palate rising
  * Larynx and the epiglottis retroflexing over the airway
* Brief cessation of breathing followed by an exhalation

<a id='949777df-bcb6-4c31-8fce-a85e881d391d'></a>

The esophageal phase is also involuntary. The upper esophageal sphincter opens, and food is propelled to the stomach by peristaltic action. The delicate, millisecond choreography among the neurological, gastrointestinal (GI), and respiratory systems is important in every swallow. That is why eating and drinking are difficult tasks and why swallowing safety can be so easily disrupted by developmental, physiologic, or anatomic variation.

<a id='3c1bad26-82af-4043-bc07-9252f2c6e183'></a>

Feeding, eating, and swallowing difficulties include⁶ food processing issues occurring in the preparatory and oral stages of swallowing, also known as oromotor problems, which are most common in children with neurological impairment (NI). Children with NI may be completely dependent on others and unable to signal hunger or thirst, thereby limiting their intake. Swallowing difficulty and aspiration are problems related to the pharyngeal and esophageal stages and are most often present in children with disabilities or anatomic variations in the aerodigestive tract.

<a id='ba3aa801-5129-496d-a744-d69f4137eb1e'></a>

Oral-sensory problems occur most often in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), although they can be present with any developmental disability, and are one of the reasons for food selectivity in children with ASD. The sensation, smell, texture, presentation, and viscosity of food can result in aversive behavior in some children and limit their food intake. Behavioral challenges that impact intake and increase stress in caregivers can occur in any child, whether they are typically developing or have NI. Self-feeding difficulties may be related to behavioral challenges, NI, or anatomic variation of their limbs.

<a id='6b4cf6a1-4c3e-4093-b36f-a98b581db654'></a>

***Conditions Causing Feeding, Eating, and Swallowing Difficulties***

Feeding, eating, and swallowing difficulties may occur in children with any of the following conditions.

<a id='e95f7592-c8f5-4124-842d-98da8a3c1cd1'></a>

# Craniofacial Anomalies
* Choanal atresia may cause difficulties because infants are obligate nasal breathers.
* A cleft lip may also cause difficulties, so consider using a nipple with a broad base or alternating different positions during breastfeeding so that the baby gets a good seal.

<a id='86b9d2fc-3a43-4b8f-a1d7-fbaee3c1229f'></a>

- A cleft palate can impact food/liquid intake, processing, and swallowing, so special bottle systems with a one-way valve can help infants who cannot develop suction because of the open palate.
- Chiari malformations may impact swallowing function because of brain stem effects.

<a id='01647961-9097-475f-8799-f5898d5db1c8'></a>

# Aerodigestive Tract Anomalies

*   Laryngomalacia: It is important to pay close attention to infants' respiratory effort expended for drinking by monitoring weight gain.
*   Vocal cord dysfunction: Can occur congenitally or after cardiothoracic surgery and can impair airway protection, so consider the following:
    *   liquid modification,
    *   adjusting liquid flow, and
    *   alternative positions for breastfeeding may help.
*   Tracheolaryngeal clefts: Success of feeding depends on the depth of the cleft. Some require surgical intervention. Swallowing can be affected long after the surgical repair.
*   Tracheoesophageal fistula with or without esophageal atresia: Requires surgical intervention and there can be ongoing challenges with swallowing after repair.
*   Vascular rings
*   Tumors/growths

<a id='5c080ef7-d726-49a0-8084-3c3c8c370491'></a>

**Neurological Conditions, Developmental Variation, and Genetic Conditions**

Any condition impacting the nerves or muscles can affect the complex choreography between swallowing and breathing that is required for successful eating and drinking, from accepting food to swallowing. Children benefit from a concerted look at all the factors that affect feeding, from co-occurring medical conditions, their oromotor and swallowing skills, their nutrition status, and the feeding environment to their families' values around feeding or eating.

<a id='c83371d8-4bdd-4d31-b685-5bb02f7d3487'></a>

**Chronic Lung Disease and Cardiovascular Disease**

Chronic lung disease can impact the respiratory rate and effort during eating or feeding, which can impact swallowing safety. Changes in the respiratory rate and effort can impact swallowing safety. Cardiovascular disease can also impact feeding, eating, and swallowing. The energy required during the process of food consumption can be high in children

<a id='2ed3d27f-1b98-4083-b3bc-af0d8b653174'></a>

with heart disease. This can result in the energy cost of drinking/eating
exceeding their caloric intake.

<a id='ad3e4b3d-4ae0-46a8-8e2d-2d2340c3f729'></a>

# GI Tract Disturbance

GER disease can impact swallowing function by affecting the esophageal phase of swallowing. It can also cause aspiration of refluxate. Allergic phenomena such as food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome, eosinophilic esophagitis, or IgE-mediated food allergies can all affect intake and change a child and family's approach to food. Limited dietary repertoires may have to be initiated. Constipation can also have significant negative impact on intake of food.

<a id='80cfa7f0-7f43-4391-95f9-bae3495a1f2e'></a>

**Preterm Birth**

Preterm birth can affect the feeding process because preterm infants often have chronic lung disease, which can be associated with feeding difficulties. They may have difficulties transitioning from enteral nutrition (EN) support to oral feeding, so consider the following:
* oromotor work,
* positioning, and
* flow control from the nipple.

<a id='a539a604-d2aa-4052-8f9c-f1a6697deb2e'></a>

A lot of patience with very cautious increases in intake can facilitate safe feeding.

<a id='ab523346-6e51-48b2-b6d6-ba4594f4c46d'></a>

**An Approach to Feeding, Eating, and Drinking Difficulties**

The International Classification of Function, Disease and Disability? can be used to map feeding difficulties regardless of the underlying problems. If one can identify a barrier to oral intake, then it is potentially amenable to intervention by one of the multidisciplinary team members, the family, or other players involved in the child's care and feeding.

The following are considerations for approaching feeding, eating, and drinking difficulties. All the factors are interdependent.

1. Fitness to eat
   a. Cognition, awareness, and sensing hunger and thirst

<a id='f3013ed0-459c-4e50-b671-9d87c5ca0141'></a>

b. Strength, control, and endurance
c. Impact of illness and hospitalization on intake

2. Health
   a. Nutrition and hydration
   b. Secretion management
   c. Aspiration
   d. Respiratory illness
     * Chronic lung disease
     * Obstructive sleep apnea
   e. Cardiovascular disease
   f. GI disturbances
     * Food protein-induced syndromes
     * GER
     * Constipation
   g. Pubertal status affecting weight gain and growth rates⁸

3. Functional motor ability to consume food
   a. Sensory factors affecting intake
   b. Positioning challenges for children with skeletal deformities
   c. Oromotor skills
   d. Swallowing competence

4. Adaptation of the environment to foster participation in eating
   a. Safety of eating across all environments
   b. Training all caregivers
   c. Participation in the "activity of eating," when possible, with family, at school, and in community settings

5. Environmental factors
   a. Family values around food
   b. Adequate time to eat
   c. Appropriate utensils
   d. Access to appropriate, affordable food
   e. Food preparation for appropriate texture and viscosity
   f. Air quality affecting lung health and thereby affecting oral intake and swallowing competence

6. Personal factors
   a. Behavioral issues interfering with intake
   b. Food preferences

<a id='38fb4a00-ab07-4ce8-9cb3-8e7d185f88dc'></a>

_**Medical Tests in the Assessment of Eating and Drinking Difficulties**_

A good history, physical examination, and feeding observation lie at the heart of a complete feeding assessment. Instrumental swallowing assessments such as a videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS) or a

<a id='7fc4ed5e-944f-464f-a3e3-193c52253ad9'></a>

fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) are extensions of the clinical information obtained in the feeding observation and are the only way to definitively diagnose swallowing dysfunction and aspiration.

<a id='63f29e46-7554-49e9-9dc1-09dc39b3fe1f'></a>

## Other common tests for children with eating and drinking difficulties
include the following:

*   Chest x-ray to assess chronic signs of aspiration.
*   VFSS, also known as a "modified barium swallow," can be used to assess all phases of swallowing and assist in the decisions about making the oral feeding experience safer.
    *   Food and liquids of different skill level—appropriate consistencies, viscosities, and textures are mixed with contrast and offered to the child sitting in a chair that supports them well.
    *   The VFSS is not the same as an upper GI series, which is also sometimes called a "barium swallow." Whereas the VFSS focuses on the path of a food bolus from the mouth, through the pharynx and esophagus, an upper GI series looks more broadly at the upper GI anatomy.
*   FEES, an evaluation in which a laryngoscope is placed above the larynx while feeding is observed. Although the FEES can determine aspiration by direct visualization, part of the swallowing process cannot be seen because the food/liquid bolus envelopes the scope.
*   A salivagram is a nuclear medicine test showing the transit of saliva from the mouth to the stomach or, if not swallowed correctly, into the lungs. A small amount of tracer is placed on the child's tongue, and the progress of the tracer is followed to see if any saliva enters the lung.
*   In an upper GI series, an x-ray contrast study is often done when reflux is suspected and one wants to clarify the anatomy to ensure that there are no factors predisposing the child to GER (ie, outflow obstruction of the stomach or malrotation of the intestine). Although the study does not quantitate GER, it does provide valuable information about the upper GI tract, through which the food boluses must travel.
*   Endoscopy of the otorhinological system, respiratory system, and the GI tract may be required to fully diagnose complex conditions involving all 3 systems (anatomic and physiologic).

***Interventions for Swallowing Dysfunction***

Swallowing safety is impacted by a host of factors, which have been mentioned in previous sections. One of the mainstays of managing swallowing dysfunction is ensuring that the food texture and viscosity are appropriate for the child's skill level. In small infants for whom thickening may not be appropriate (see the following list), swallowing safety may be improved by positioning, pacing the feeding, and changing the flow from the nipple. In older children, texture changes may be

<a id='172d9b44-375a-48aa-bd6f-b113a64d93be'></a>

required to ensure that the bolus is homogeneous because of poor oral
processing skills or because a cohesive food bolus is required to prevent
the bolus from dividing in the pharynx and causing aspiration.

<a id='d19ff950-b49b-4122-90d6-a92fea4cbd2b'></a>

Improving swallowing safety may involve thickening the liquids, which changes the swallowing mechanics and improves pacing as the bolus moves through the oropharynx.⁹

* The effect of thickening may lie in the inherent properties of a thickened liquid being more cohesive.
* Thickening may, however, result in more residual food in the pharynx that a child is unable to clear because of pharyngeal muscle weakness. This residual material causes a risk of aspiration.
* Thickening may also decrease liquid palatability and increase the risk of dehydration.¹⁰ AVFSS or FEES can help determine the most appropriate food consistency, texture, and viscosity for a child and help improve swallowing safety.

_**The International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative**_

The International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative (IDDSI) was founded with the goal of developing new international standardized terminology and definitions to describe texture- and viscosity-modified foods and thickened liquids. Aligning our vocabulary with the IDDSI terms in our clinical assessments and in commercial and home kitchens where food modification is required will result in a common language that improves our understanding and communication of a child's needs with colleagues and members of assessment teams. Figure 3-1 illustrates the IDDSI categorization of food and liquid viscosities and consistencies.

The IDDSI group also developed the "syringe flow test" to measure
the consistency, thickness, and flow properties of foods by using utensils
that can easily be sourced for home. The tool allows families to try
different thickeners to improve palatability and thereby increases
adherence to the use of thickened liquids, which may mitigate the
aspiration risk.

<a id='a0e4d342-9617-4ca5-a02a-b0eeb81f465e'></a>

However, the IDDSI syringe flow test does not always match the viscosities as measured by a viscometer.12 The testing is impacted by the degree of blending and, among other factors, the residual fiber size after the blending process has been completed and whether a kitchen strainer has been used to remove them. These fiber particulates can clog the test syringe and thus overestimate the thickness or viscosity of the preparation tested.13 The IDDSI syringe test is illustrated in Figure 3-2.

THE IDDSI Flow Test is used to classify liquid thickness

<a id='3fc957eb-9f7a-4090-abda-bcfcd4eb2d8d'></a>

IDDSI uses an objective measurement tool for liquid thickness, 10 mL syringe. In the near future funnels that have been specifically designed for IDDSI testing may be available.

Sometimes, viscosity, consistency, or texture changes achieved by using blenderized tube feeding is recommended for the treatment of retching, GER, or GER-related aspiration events. In that case, the IDDSI syringe flow test may need to be carried out after using a kitchen strainer to minimize the impact of the particulates on the flow measurement.

Thickening Agents

<a id='f3d0dd73-7d79-4fb9-bbe6-1e09f3359c09'></a>

Commercial thickeners need to be used with caution in preterm infants, especially before they reach 44 weeks' corrected gestational age. In these small infants, there is a risk of late-onset necrotizing enterocolitis. 14 Most commercial thickeners carry a warning not to use them before certain ages. Thickeners can negatively impact gastric emptying and the palatability and digestibility of the infant formula or breast milk. When considering thickener use, close teamwork among dietitians, swallowing specialists (speech language pathologists, occupational therapists, or feeding team pediatricians), and the medical team is invaluable in achieving a nutritious diet that is safer for infants and children to swallow. Table 3-2 outlines the use of thickening agents for children with dysphagia. 14,15

**Options for Route of Intake**

When oral feeding is unsafe or insufficient to meet the nutrition
requirements, enteral feeding may be required. Family considerations are
very important when discussing the move from oral to enteral feeding. In
general, families value oral feeding and eating because they are so
important to all cultures and heritages. It is around the table that we learn

<a id='40cd9d37-263e-44c9-92f0-0bc226caf4f8'></a>

communication skills, where we learn about celebrations and family traditions.

<a id='fb41371f-01ae-4ae3-a3ea-898723636f59'></a>

When introducing the concept of enteral feeding, it is important for team members to explore the family values around eating and drinking. Family goals about oral feeding should be discussed, and when there are foods with textures or viscosities that are safe for the children to continue eating, these should be incorporated into an overall nutrition care plan.

<a id='ce70bca9-2f51-465c-9d20-bb1d84869356'></a>

It is important for team members evaluating oral feeding to appreciate that skills do change over time for many children, and therefore, enteral feeding may only be required temporarily. Thus, developing an “exit strategy” from EN support may be appropriate early during enteral feeding, whether by nasogastric tube, gastrostomy tube, or postpyloric tube. Table 3-3 describes the various types of enteral access devices (EADs) for nutrition support and the advantages and disadvantages for use. 16–21 (See also chapter 5, “Enteral Nutrition,” for more information on various types of EADs.)
