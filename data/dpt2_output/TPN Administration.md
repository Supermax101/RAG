I. PURPOSE:
The purpose of this procedure is to ensure the safe administration of 1) parenteral nutrition and 2) lipid (fat) emulsion.

Who May Perform: Registered Nurse (RN)

II. DEFINITIONS
A. Parenteral nutrition (PN):
1. Consists of a dextrose and amino acid preparation which is prescribed to meet nutritional requirements of patients who cannot receive adequate nutrition via the gastrointestinal tract.
2. Administered as
a. Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) through a central venous access device (CVAD)
b. Peripheral Parenteral Nutrition (PPN) through a peripheral catheter.
3. Cyclic TPN is the administration of TPN solution over less than 24 hours a day.
B. Lipid (fat) emulsion: Is a component of PN used to prevent essential fatty acid deficiency and provide an additional source of calories; may be a separate infusion from the other components of PN.
C. Licensed Independent Practitioner (LIP): Any practitioner permitted by law and the organization to provide care and services, without direction or supervision, within the scope of the practitioner license and consistent with individually assigned clinical responsibilities and can perform within their scope of practice.
D. Advanced Practice Providers (APP): include but not limited to physician assistants (PAs), nurse practitioners (NPs), certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs), certified nurse midwives (CNMs), and clinical nurse specialists (CNSs) who can provide care and services under the supervision of a LIP.

III. SUPPORTIVE INFORMATION:
A. Indications/Contraindications
1. Indications
a. Patients who are malnourished or at risk of malnutrition when enteral feeding is contraindicated, not tolerated, or insufficient to maintain or restore nutritional status.
B. Precautions
1. Reduce infection risk
a. Verify order to use central line is present before the catheter is used for TPN.
b. It is preferred to dedicate a single lumen to PN administration when a multi lumen CVAD in place.
i. For bone marrow transplant (BMT) patients, refer to Appendix B

<a id='466960e3-c49f-4f9a-a110-485aedeaaaba'></a>

c. Schedule bag, tubing, filter, and dressing changes at the same time whenever possible to minimize manipulation and entry of the system.
d. Change tubing, filter, and solution every 24 hours:
    i. TPN/PPN
    ii. Lipids
    iii. Replace with a new bag even if not completely infused. Refer to [Labeling Standardization - Process Maps](Labeling Standardization - Process Maps)

2. Lipid administration
    a. Do not give lipids to patients with egg, soy, peanut, or fish allergies without a discussion between the patient and treatment team.
    b. Lipid emulsion is isotonic and can be given safely through a peripheral line or CVAD

3. Monitor labs for tolerance, glucose levels, and metabolic and nutritional status
    a. Serum glucose levels should be checked at a minimum once daily on all patients receiving TPN.
    b. If there is any interruption in the administration of the TPN or PPN solution, notify APP/LIP immediately for dextrose containing solution order.

4. Extravasation risk
    a. PPN may increase risk of phlebitis.
    b. May administer PPN via peripheral IV if PPN solutions/emulsions have a final concentration of 10% dextrose or lower.
    c. Do not use midline catheters for TPN or PPN administration.
    d. In the event of extravasation, refer to: [Extravasation - Early Identification and Management of intravenous Vesicant and Irritants (Cytotoxic and Non-Cytotoxic Agents)](Extravasation - Early Identification and Management of intravenous Vesicant and Irritants (Cytotoxic and Non-Cytotoxic Agents))

<::diagram of TPN/PPN/Lipids Tubing Set-Up:

The diagram illustrates a medical tubing setup for administering TPN (Total Parenteral Nutrition), PPN (Peripheral Parenteral Nutrition), and Lipids.

At the top, two bags are suspended from a vertical pole:
- A grey bag labeled "Lipids".
- A yellow bag labeled "TPN/PPN".

Tubing (represented by green lines) connects these bags to a central pump.

From the 'Lipids' bag, an "Extension Set DEHP-Free (#10942011)" connects to a vertical grey component labeled "LIPIDS". This then leads to a larger grey rectangular "Pump".

From the 'TPN/PPN' bag, tubing connects to a vertical grey component labeled "TPN". This also leads to the "Pump".

Below the pump, the tubing from the 'LIPIDS' side and the 'TPN' side converge at a "Y-Site".

After the "Y-Site", there is a green rectangular filter labeled "1.2-micron Filter Tubing DEHP-Free (#20127E)". A bracket below the filter and Y-site indicates "Place filter BELOW Y-Site".

The tubing terminates with three colored connectors (purple, red, and blue).

## Appendix B: Considerations for BMT population

[Back to Appendices](Back%20to%20Appendices)

<a id='522ecc61-151f-42df-9c5d-1d004460509a'></a>

1. Do not use a TPN or PPN line for any other purpose, including blood drawing, medication administration, "piggy-backing" of other solutions, or central venous pressure (CVP) measurements.
   a. Exceptions to the above include blood and marrow transplant recipients (BMT).

<a id='7743e3ba-48b4-4b83-9269-a7c469ea0fe6'></a>

2. BMT patients with limited access may have compatible medications infused through the TPN line if necessary.
   a. These drugs are infused by attaching a multi-access connector (e.g., three-four way stopcocks/manifold) to the TPN line setup. All other patients must have a LIP/APP order to "piggyback" solution or medications.
