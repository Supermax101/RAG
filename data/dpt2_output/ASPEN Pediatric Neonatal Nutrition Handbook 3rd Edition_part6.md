## Introduction
A food allergy is an adverse reaction arising from a specific immune response that occurs reproducibly on exposure to a given food. Based on the pathophysiologic characteristics, food allergies are classified as immunoglobin E (IgE)-mediated, non-IgE-mediated, or mixed type (Table 8-1). Major food allergens include cow's milk, eggs, soy, fish/shellfish, peanut/tree nuts, and wheat. IgE-mediated reactions are rapid, beginning within minutes to 2 hours from ingestion with a wide spectrum of manifestations involving the skin, respiratory system, gastrointestinal (GI) system, and cardiovascular system. Non-IgE-mediated reactions are more subacute or chronic and usually involve the GI system and skin. The mainstay of management of food allergies is avoidance of the specific food.¹

Children with food allergies may have nutrient deficiencies because of food restriction and are at risk of growth failure, micronutrient deficiency, and feeding difficulties. The child's growth should be closely monitored, and a dietitian should be involved to ensure appropriate dietary intake, particularly when more than one food allergy is present. The role of the dietitian is 2-fold: education of the child and family to avoid the allergenic foods and suggestion of replacement foods that are of similar nutritional value.

<a id='7fc935ac-3614-4aad-8450-2f44d17ea08b'></a>

**Assessment and Nutrient Requirements**

Because of allergen avoidance, children with food allergies are at risk for nutrient deficiencies. Assessment involves careful history taking and thorough physical examination.

* History: feeding history, dietary recall, and use of food substitutes
* Nutrition-focused physical examination
* Anthropometric assessment: weight, height or length, head circumference, body mass index, weight for length, and mid-upper arm circumference

<a id='d51157a9-3833-4771-bece-94a2a9647e84'></a>

Implementation of Nutrition Plan and Monitoring

<a id='47c43a79-7954-4bc1-80fb-76fd9daaa895'></a>

The mainstay of managing food allergies is allergen avoidance, therefore
it is important that patients and families are educated on the following:

*   reading and understanding food labels,
*   prevention of cross-contamination through shared utensils and other means, and
*   careful replacement with foods that are nutritionally similar and micronutrient
    supplementation when needed.

<a id='91373dfa-2e85-4e69-9371-4265cb0100fe'></a>

# Milk Allergy
Maternal restriction of cow milk protein is not required for IgE-mediated allergies in breastfed infants. For non-IgE-mediated allergies in infants, maternal dairy elimination is recommended. Infants with a true milk allergy should be given substitute formula like elemental formula or protein hydrolysate formula until 2 years of age. These formulas are complete sources of calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D, vitamin B12, riboflavin, and pantothenic acid. For toddlers with cow milk protein allergy, an elemental pediatric formula can be an appropriate replacement.

<a id='ed385eb3-ac86-4dca-b693-334bcd9ac69b'></a>

Some plant-based milks like enriched soy milk may be a suitable replacement. Pea protein-based milk, depending on the specific energy, protein, vitamin, and mineral content of the product, may also be an alternative for children who are allergic to both cow and soy milk. In general, almond, rice, coconut, hemp, flax seed, and cashew milks do not meet protein, calcium, and vitamin D needs of toddlers and should be avoided when used as the primary nutritious beverage. 1,2

<a id='f46b1ea5-f759-47b7-ab44-cc6cb84b9c03'></a>

_**Egg Allergy**_

Eggs are a source of vitamins B₂, B₃, B₁₂, E, folic acid, biotin, selenium, iron, and chromium.³ Other foods such as milk, soy, meat, and fish can be the source of these micronutrients. Because eggs do not account for a large percentage of daily diet, sole egg avoidance is unlikely to cause significant deficiencies. Eggs are frequently used in recipes, so parents should know how to replace eggs in such recipes.¹

<a id='49738cbf-da8f-4212-b1df-52ccae7a4d1f'></a>

**Soybean Allergy**
Soy is rich in thiamin, vitamin B², niacin, iron, zinc, selenium, chromium, and folic acid.³ Soy does not constitute a large portion of diet, therefore sole soy restriction is unlikely to cause nutrient deficiencies. Soybeans are found in products like tofu, edamame, tempeh, and soy sauce. Heat-pressed soybean oil and lecithin, commonly found in packaged foods, are highly refined and generally well tolerated because soy protein is removed. Children with concomitant cow milk and soy allergies are at high risk of nutrient deficiencies and require very careful nutrition management.¹

<a id='2e32b8d7-57af-421c-9cda-d703e88ab718'></a>

**Wheat Allergy**

Wheat is a major source of carbohydrates. Wheat is also rich in micronutrients like thiamin, vitamin B₂, niacin, iron, zinc, selenium, chromium, and folic acid.³ Alternative grains and flours like rice, corn, oat, barley, quinoa, buckwheat, millet, amaranth, potato, and arrowroot can serve as suitable replacements. Patients can have allergy to multiple grains, so tolerance of other grains should be monitored.¹

<a id='3bfdc4f7-8cb2-4e2c-a60a-52a7440e8cfd'></a>

# Nuts

Nuts do not form a large portion of daily dietary intake and hence do not need replacement. Tree nuts include almond, cashew, chestnut, macadamia, pecan, pine nut, pistachio, Brazil nut, filbert/hazelnut, and walnut.¹ Nuts are commonly found in confectionery foods such as candy and cookies, and food labels need to be read very carefully. Peanut oil is safe if it is heat pressed, but crude peanut oil should be avoided.

<a id='b7b90d81-b685-4a84-a476-305b4f093e31'></a>

## Food Protein–Induced Enterocolitis

Food protein–induced enterocolitis (FPIES) is a potential emergency, which can present in infants and young children with vomiting and diarrhea severe enough to cause hemodynamic instability. Symptoms

<a id='71313279-d99c-4795-9b4c-1907ca29a5cf'></a>

develop 1–4 hours after ingestion and resolve 24 hours after ingestion. The diagnosis is made clinically with improvement after withdrawal of the allergen. The mainstay of management of FPIES is elimination of trigger foods from the diet.

<a id='ff2f6914-39af-4fb2-a259-ba5259544ff5'></a>

### Implementation of Nutrition Plan and Monitoring

Particularly with FPIES to multiple foods, the risk of nutrient deficiency increases, and consultation with a dietitian is recommended. Infants with FPIES should be on extensively hydrolyzed formula. Some children may require elemental formula. Foods that enhance feeding skills with various tastes and textures are recommended. Timely introduction of different flavors and textures positively impacts feeding skills.4

<a id='b3b5cf35-5575-4252-a1c4-d25ff8748fd8'></a>

# Eosinophilic Esophagitis

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic allergen-mediated esophageal inflammatory disease. Classic symptoms include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, malnutrition, feeding disorder, and food impaction. Diagnosis is usually made by upper endoscopy and biopsy confirmation of elevated eosinophilic counts in esophageal tissue. Treatment includes dietary therapy and medications. Medications include proton pump inhibitors, topical corticosteroids, and monoclonal antibodies. Dietary therapies include elemental diet, allergen-directed elimination diet, and empiric elimination diet. We will focus on the dietary management of EoE.

<a id='e8fd6a6d-1c21-41eb-84c9-12c0122b3836'></a>

***Implementation of Nutrition Plan and Monitoring***

Elemental (or amino acid-based) formula eliminates all potential food allergens. It is 90% effective in the treatment of EoE in children and adults. The approach is very effective but because the diet is restricted solely to formula with poor palatability, it is associated with a lower quality of life.

<a id='6bd8fe22-ee99-4083-86e4-e95966379111'></a>

An allergen-directed elimination diet refers to the avoidance of foods
that are identified as allergens via allergy testing. It has been successful
only in less than 50% of patients with EoE and is not recommended.

<a id='33214963-c748-43a5-9d2c-e90ef0d9ee1f'></a>

Empiric elimination diets involve removing the most common food allergens (cow's milk, wheat, soy, egg, peanut/tree nut, fish/shellfish). The efficacy of the 6-food elimination diet, wherein all the most common food allergens are eliminated, is around 70%. However, in an effort to decrease food restriction and improve quality of life, decreasing the number of eliminated foods and a step-up of empiric diet is possible.

<a id='8d655bf3-f887-4d36-a684-0a2238ab2704'></a>

The rates of success vary from approximately 50% for elimination of cow's milk alone (the most common food allergen implicated in EoE) to 64% for 4-food elimination diet (cow's milk, soy, egg, and wheat).

<a id='9f0ebb17-d925-4efd-9570-c7c3dbe8c402'></a>

With the empiric elimination diets, histologic response is monitored,
and foods can be sequentially eliminated (when response is inadequate)
or reintroduced (when response is good) to enable the patient to be on the
least restrictive diet needed for the optimal therapy for EoE.⁵

<a id='81bd4d80-af8d-4fb0-ac19-f2872bb818d5'></a>

With the avoidance of foods that constitute a major portion of the diet,
understanding how to avoid the allergenic foods and then optimally
replace them is crucial. Such education by a registered dietitian is
important to avoid malnutrition and nutrient deficiencies.

# Introduction

Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth anomaly in children with a prevalence in 9 of 1000 live births.¹ A significant proportion of neonates with a CHD diagnosis will not survive without a surgical or catheter-based intervention in the newborn period.² As survival has improved, both short-term and long-term morbidities assume greater importance and have been brought to the forefront. Issues with feeding and growth are major concerns for children with CHD.³ Most neonates with CHD are born at term with anthropometric measurements that fall within the reference range, but they quickly begin to experience nutrition challenges that place them at high risk for growth failure and malnutrition. All neonates who require cardiac surgery within the first few days to weeks of life are at risk for growth faltering. Length is affected as much as weight with less recovery of length compared with weight. In fact, short stature is a life-long issue for children with CHD,⁴,⁵ particularly for those with univentricular or single-ventricle heart defects.

<a id='ff3eed1a-1b49-4db4-b9fa-1715e9eda2bc'></a>

To identify best nutrition practices to improve growth, the National Pediatric Cardiology Quality Improvement Collaborative (NPC-QIC) formed a Feeding Workgroup composed of surgeons, physicians, dietitians, speech and occupational therapists, nurses, and parents from over 50 centers across North America.6 This workgroup has provided best practice recommendations to promote a uniform approach to nutrition of children with CHD across institutions. The value of a structured nutrition program with establishment of best practices in nutrition (assessment, prescription, delivery and evaluation) is well recognized in the current era among patients with heart defects.6,7

<a id='7c982947-142c-4589-a166-dd3cccdeecfa'></a>

In this chapter, we focus on nutrition considerations in neonates who
require cardiac interventions within the first few days to weeks of life.
These principles can also be applied broadly to older children with
congenital and acquired cardiac defects, including those presenting with
heart failure.

<a id='c2afbffe-58d6-4889-be7f-043edacb1f6e'></a>

**_Risks and Special Considerations_**

The etiology of growth failure is multifactorial from a combination of inadequate caloric intake; high metabolic demand; gastrointestinal (GI) pathology, including malabsorption and gastroesophageal reflux (GER); and endocrine and genetic factors.3

Factors that impede the delivery of adequate enteral nutrition in the cardiac population include vocal cord dysfunction, poor oral coordination and endurance, emesis, and feeding intolerance.

Other challenges include concerns for poor cardiac output, the need for inotropic support, limitations of fluid intake, the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), and frequent interruptions in nutrient delivery because of both patient-specific factors as well as diagnostic and therapeutic considerations.

<a id='216de03c-dc49-4420-b627-ab3b13ea8d97'></a>

Neonates with CHD experience NEC more commonly compared with healthy neonates who have reported incidence of 2.5%–5% and may experience significant morbidity.⁸ Neonates with CHD who are treated with prostaglandin infusion to maintain patency of the ductus arteriosus are at risk for splanchnic ischemia owing to the presence of diastolic vascular runoff and reversal of flow in the mesenteric artery. This risk

<a id='357af7ff-315c-4093-9753-86dfab9290e6'></a>

persists in infants with shunt-dependent circulation, including those with an aortopulmonary shunt or a stent in the patent ductus arteriosus. Prematurity substantially increases the risk of NEC. Other potential risk factors include chronic cyanosis, the presence of umbilical arterial catheters, and the inflammatory cascade activated by cardiopulmonary bypass. The Feeding Workgroup of the NPC-QIC has focused on addressing these concerns in single-ventricle patients who are considered the highest risk for intestinal hypoperfusion and NEC.9

Assessment and Nutrient Requirements

**_Anthropometry and Energy Expenditure_**

For hospitalized neonates with CHD,

* weight should be measured daily (unless hemodynamically unstable)
* length should be measured weekly
* head circumference should be measured monthly

<a id='f339235b-dc56-4a60-809a-d4d5c748ebcf'></a>

Fluid shifts and fluid overload may affect anthropometric measurements, especially weight. There is no evidence to support the use of biochemical markers to monitor nutrition status. Studies have shown that standard predictive equations frequently overestimate energy needs in the postoperative period. While it is technically challenging to accurately measure resting energy expenditure (REE) in mechanically ventilated patients, indirect calorimetry (IC) may be used to measure REE in postoperative patients.10 When IC is not available or practical, use the Schofield equation to estimate energy needs.

## Implementation of Nutrition Plan and Monitoring

Nutrition therapy for infants and children with CHD is vital to the care continuum and life span—from acute critical illness through chronic illness and from infancy through adulthood. Accurate assessment of nutrition requirements and provision of adequate nutrition through the most physiologically appropriate route play an important role in

<a id='8d3a34aa-cc19-45c4-9ea5-9c60dac8dcb9'></a>

enhancing outcomes. 11 Close monitoring and evaluation are required to minimize risk of malnutrition and its complications.

<a id='0d130897-0694-4a4f-87fd-5849b26962e1'></a>

_**Preoperative Feeding Guidelines**_

Prostaglandin infusions are not a contraindication to enteral feeding. There is sufficient evidence to support the safe provision of enteral feeds in the preoperative period in hemodynamically stable neonates treated with prostaglandin infusion.⁹ Enteral feeding can be achieved safely with appropriate vigilance and intensive monitoring. Oral ad lib feedings should be encouraged, although early feeding intolerance may suggest poor systemic perfusion and/or impending shock or NEC states.

<a id='6dd741be-3be5-4e7f-af11-ba8b2f4e6723'></a>

Human milk is the preferred feeding option given its immunologic benefits and high biologically available protein. Standard infant formula is used when human milk is not available with specialty formula preparations as dictated by the clinical condition. Early initiation of parenteral nutrition (PN) is important to promote positive nitrogen balance and mitigate perioperative risk of malnutrition. Umbilical catheters are not a contraindication to enteral feeding.

<a id='2516f9a5-5d14-4000-9cb3-49defdf654a9'></a>

## Postoperative Nutrition Support

The best surgical outcomes are accomplished when patients can establish positive nitrogen balance and maintain good nutrition status postoperatively. The goal of postoperative nutrition management is to optimize nutrient delivery while accounting for changes in the hemodynamic and medical stability of the patient. Evidence suggests that there are 3 predominant phases in critically ill children during which macronutrient requirements change considerably:

1. Acute phase
2. Stable phase
3. Recovery phase

<a id='eee08855-942f-47fc-b8bb-458fba71a14e'></a>

Metabolic targets and nutrition goals change based on the phase of
disease state, but generally growth is not a critical priority in the
immediate postoperative period. Growth does not resume until the

<a id='0b873088-0398-465a-af52-6e68552fa7e0'></a>

postoperative stress response resolves, and positive nitrogen balance is attained.

<a id='9324ee22-a046-4a6a-aed5-acae2db8a741'></a>

Studies of REE in critically ill infants after cardiac surgery have observed that outcomes are improved with a minimum intake of 43 kcal/kg/d. Energy needs are reduced for the first 3–5 postoperative days: approximately 55–65 kcal/kg/d. As patients recover, energy needs increase substantially: at least 120–150 kcal/kg/d. Estimated nutrition needs require reassessment at regular intervals (see Table 9-1.)12

A standardized approach to nutrition therapy using clinical pathways has demonstrated positive outcomes in infants with CHD, including reduced time to achieve goal calories, increased percentage of patients meeting energy and protein targets, decreased incidence of NEC, decreased duration of postoperative PN, decreased hospital length of stay, and improved weight-for-age z score change over the course of hospitalization. 7,13–15

The following are general guidelines for provision of nutrition in the

postoperative period:

*   Use PN in the early postoperative period while advancing enteral feeds.
*   Initiate enteral feeds as early as possible once hemodynamic stability is established.
*   Consider use of a standardized protocol or algorithm for nutrition delivery that includes guidance on type of feeds, mode of feeding, feed advance, and relative contraindications/considerations or ‘’red flags’’6,7 (see Figure 9-1).

Types of feeds include the following:

* Human milk is preferred but often needs to be fortified, and higher concentration standard formulas are frequently required.
* In infants with a history of NEC or significant feeding intolerance, the use of semi-elemental or elemental formulas may be more appropriate.

<a id='c11493ba-9889-4963-9798-e93c30d8ab60'></a>

* Emerging literature suggests that peptide nutrient-energy dense formulas can be safely provided to neonates and infants with CHD.16

<a id='28e3d7db-40f9-484c-b681-9b8adc53bb4f'></a>

Postpyloric rather than gastric tube feedings are frequently used in infants with marginal respiratory status and in those with severe GER. Optimization of therapy for GER includes the use of alternative formulas, appropriate positioning, and medications such as prokinetic agents and proton pump inhibitors. Standardization of airway evaluation and assessment of safe swallowing ability in infants with suspected or confirmed vocal cord injury and feeding difficulties with oral aversion is key to facilitate and establish oral feeding.

# Special Situations

## Chylothorax

Chylothorax, or an accumulation of milky-appearing chyle within the pleural space, is a well-known and increasingly more-prevalent complication of cardiac surgery and is associated with greater postoperative morbidity and mortality. This condition is estimated to occur in 2.5%-4.7% of patients after cardiac surgery. 17 Chylothorax occurs most often as a result of traumatic injury of the thoracic duct or its surrounding lymphatic tributaries during surgery (eg, repair of coarctation or vascular ring), thrombosis of the superior vena cava resulting in occlusion, or elevated central venous pressures postoperatively (as seen in cavopulmonary connections).17 Children with genetic syndromes, including trisomy 21, Noonan and Turner syndromes, and cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome, frequently have abnormalities in their lymphatic system and are also at higher risk for developing chylothorax after cardiac surgery.

<a id='bf6c8443-c6a9-4c3e-b642-ee6409b07acf'></a>

Recognizing the large and often unnecessary practice variation in management of chylous effusions and leaks, a Pediatric Critical Care Consortium Chylothorax Workgroup representing 22 cardiac centers has recently published an algorithm to standardize and guide for making diagnostic decisions, selecting first line medical therapies, and identifying timing and duration of interventions (Figure 9-2).¹⁸

BOX 1: Diagnostic Studies to Consider
Concern for chylothorax may include: milky CTO, CTO >20mL/kg/day beginning 24 hours after chest closure, surgeon concern based on surgical findings, etc.
Pleural fluid studies confirmatory for chylothorax (at least 1 of the following must be positive):
- Triglycerides (>110 mg/dL)
- Lymphocyte predominance (>80%)
- Positive chylomicrons
- Pleural>serum triglycerides

<a id='3c4505cd-9f27-49f3-9255-c0c651feaa08'></a>

BOX 2: Etiology Work-up (Risk factors: previous chylothorax, elevated venous pressure, decreased function, and VTE)
- Venous doppler head/neck ultrasound: If VTE present, provide anticoagulation per institutional standard.
- Echo to include evaluation of SVC for thrombus and consider venogram with negative echo but suspicion for VTE remains high.
- Prior to referral to lymphatic center, complete echocardiogram and diagnostic cardiac catheterization are recommended.

Box 3: Diet Modifications Following Chylous Effusion Diagnosis

Defatted human milk, fortify as below with MCT based formula for <1 year of age. Supplement with ADEK multivitamin.

MCT based enteral formulas:
< 1 year of age: Monogen*, Enfaport, Lipstart*, or Vivonex Pediatric* (for milk protein intolerance). Supplement with 400 IU Vitamin D/day.
1-13 years of age: Monogen, Vivonex Pediatric (for milk protein intolerance), or Portagen.**
Medium Chain Triglyceride (MCT) Based Calorie Modulars: MCT oil (8 Cal/ml), Nutricia Liquigen (4.5 Cal/ml), Vitaflo MCT Procal (112 Cal/1 powder packet).

Oral Fat Modified Diet:
Start ≤10g fat/day from long-chain triglycerides to provide 2-4% total calories from linoleic acid (LA) and 0.25-0.5% from alpha-linolenic acid (ALA).

Essential Fatty Acid (EFA) Deficiency Monitoring:
EFA deficiency may develop in 1-3 weeks on no/low exogenous EFA delivery. Watch for physical symptoms including dry/scaly rash, sparse hair, poor wound healing.
For prolonged restriction or manifestation of symptoms: obtain EFA profiles, monitoring triene:tetraene ratio (>0.4 diagnostic of EFA deficiency), LFTs, platelets.

Parenteral Nutrition: Optimize calories and protein. Protein may need to be increased by 1.5-2x RDA/DRI (0-2 years old: provide 3-4 g/kg; preterm: provide 3.5-4g/kg).
Dose lipids (IL) per needs/tolerance but with minimum of 0.5g/kg/day 20% IL or 1g/kg/day SMOF (goal is 2g/kg/day SMOF for 0-12 months of age) in order to deliver ~0.1g/kg/day LA. For preterm infants, double lipid dose in order to deliver the minimum 0.25g/kg/day LA to prevent EFA deficiency.

Parental Nutrition Screening Labs: daily until stability: electrolytes (BMP) including Mg, PO4; 1-2x/week: triglycerides, LFTs and albumin.

*Nutritionally complete but off label use in patients less than 1 yo
**Not nutritionally complete, requires trace mineral supplementation

<a id='82b004ac-ef6d-4e4d-96ea-b57c658779f6'></a>

BOX 4: Additional Therapies
Additional considerations for refractory chylothorax: defined as 7 cumulative days of NPO with chest tube output remaining >10ml/kg/day
Please refer to Supplemental Table 3 for a review of potential additional therapies.

<a id='37583948-b127-4ca6-bd30-51cbcfefd562'></a>

BOX 5: Fat-modified Diet Duration
Concurrent PC4 Chylothorax Work Group project aims to decrease current fat-modified diet duration at individual institutions by 2 weeks from the previous instituional standard to a minimum of 2 weeks.

If no current **institutional standard**, we recommend no more than **4 week duration** of fat-modified diet duration.

Chylothorax management involves strategies to decrease thoracic flow, allowing the lymphatic channels to heal primarily through pleural space evacuation via chest tubes and the minimization of exposure to long-chain triglycerides (LCTs). LCTs bind with chyle to form chylomicrons for absorption and transport to the bloodstream by intestinal lymphatics, whereas medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) are directly absorbed by enterocytes into the portal venous system and do not stimulate an increase in lymphatic flow. 19 Diet modification, with use of low-fat diets supplemented with MCTs for 4-6 weeks, has been successfully used as a conservative strategy to reduce lymphatic flow (see Table 9-2).

Inadequate dietary intake of linoleic acid (LA) and \u03b1-LA (ALA)
associated with prolonged dietary fat restriction can cause essential fatty-
acid deficiency. Minimal intake of 1% of energy from LA (C18:2) and at
least 0.2% from ALA is recommended to decrease risk of deficiency.20

<a id='62a379a2-323f-4c2b-bbe7-0d92afdf8c2f'></a>

An abnormal triene/tetraene ratio (> 0.2), is indicative of essential fatty-acid deficiency. 21

<a id='4bcdf5eb-2164-48b9-a593-68dd150a78e0'></a>

Prolonged dietary restriction is not recommended and may be
harmful, resulting in nutrition deficiencies of essential fatty acids and fat-
soluble vitamins, elevated transaminases, thrombocytopenia, poor wound
healing, scaly dermatitis, hypertriglyceridemia, and growth failure.
Vitamin D and calcium supplementation are necessary in patients on
MCT oil-rich diets.

<a id='d467b4a4-ccac-46d7-a9aa-3b1bd624e93c'></a>

Resumption of regular diet, human milk, or standard formula in a stepped approach 4–6 weeks after resolution of chylous drainage and completion of low-fat diet therapy is necessary to minimize the risk of essential fatty-acid and fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies. Patients may need PN formulations containing LA and ALA to prevent essential, fatty-acid deficiency.

**_Protein-Losing Enteropathy_**

Protein-losing enteropathy (PLE) occurs when excess albumin and other protein-rich materials leak into the intestine, causing general abdominal discomfort/bloating, malabsorptive diarrhea, electrolyte derangements, and ascites. PLE occurs almost exclusively after the Fontan operation. An elevated level of stool α-1-antitrypsin indicates a general state of GI protein loss and is the primary diagnostic marker for PLE. A diet rich in protein is recommended for patients with PLE. There is no evidence to support the use of a fat-restricted diet in the management of PLE.

# Introduction

Celiac disease is an autoimmune enteropathy triggered by the intake of gluten, a protein complex found in wheat, barley, and rye. Patients can present with growth failure, osteopenia, and anemia. Celiac disease causes villous damage in the small intestine that leads to malabsorption and risk of various nutrient deficiencies. With the exclusion of gluten, patients need to avoid cereals that are either rich in or fortified with vitamins and minerals and hence are at risk of micronutrient deficiencies. Also, commercially available gluten-free foods are typically not fortified and contain lower amounts of micronutrients. Treatment of patients with celiac disease should include strategies to prevent nutrition deficiencies. At the time of diagnosis, patients may be deficient in iron, vitamin D, zinc, calcium, and folic acid. These deficiencies improve with treatment, and there is lack of consensus on usefulness of periodic assessment for micronutrient deficiencies.

**Assessment and Nutrient Requirements**
A careful history review, examination, and evaluation are critical for all patients with celiac disease to ensure appropriate nutrient provision.

<a id='b7ba1410-6c63-42d6-b3dc-3f8561a81db7'></a>

* History: Extensive review of dietary history to identify any inadvertent exposure to gluten
* Nutrition-focused physical examination
* Anthropometric assessment: Weight, height/length, head circumference, body mass index, weight for length, and mid-upper arm circumference
* Laboratory assessment: screening for micronutrient deficiency at diagnosis and periodically, if needed

<a id='4bcb9ea7-7e04-4cdb-9725-22cce8075e44'></a>

**Implementation of Nutrition Plan and Monitoring**

The fundamental treatment of patients with celiac disease is a lifelong gluten-free diet, which involves avoidance of wheat, barley, and rye (Table 10-1). Natural gluten-free foods such as meat, fish, legumes, and vegetables should be encouraged because their nutritional value is higher than commercially prepared gluten-free foods in terms of lipid composition and vitamin content.

Detailed food-label reading and education with a registered dietitian to ensure patients are not inadvertently consuming gluten is recommended. For example, oats that are labeled as gluten free can be consumed, whereas other oats may be contaminated with wheat during processing (Exhibit 10-1). Pseudocereals such as quinoa and buckwheat are considered good alternatives because they have ample fiber, vitamin, proteins, and polyunsaturated fatty acids. For foods to be labeled gluten free, the gluten level should be less than 20 ppm. Consumption of more than 10–100 mg/d can cause mucosal damage.¹

**Prevention of Micronutrient and Vitamin Deficiency**
Celiac disease can affect bone health. Age-appropriate calcium and
vitamin D intake and regular exercise to promote bone health should be
encouraged.2

<a id='0d3c0def-50d9-48eb-84c6-35a821ef3eb4'></a>

With prolonged delay in diagnosis of celiac disease or symptomatic patients with rickets or bone pain, laboratory testing including 25-hydroxy vitamin D, calcium, phosphate, and parathyroid hormone levels should be considered. Patients with deficiencies should be treated, and annual screening should be repeated until levels normalize. At diagnosis, because of malabsorption, an evaluation for iron-deficiency anemia with iron studies is recommended. A complete blood cell count and iron studies should also be obtained annually.

<a id='963c96b9-143e-451f-86a4-d97c1744166d'></a>

Gluten-free diets are known to be low in vitamins D, E, and B12,
folate, iron, magnesium, potassium, calcium, zinc, and sodium. Long-
term, a complete multivitamin-multimineral preparation that is gluten
free should be considered.3

# Introduction

Critical illness or trauma in children is a complex state characterized by abnormal vital organ function that, if untreated, will progress to life-threatening physiologic deterioration and mortality.¹ During critical illness, the mechanical, hormonal, immunologic, and motility functions of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and associated organs are disrupted to varying degrees, resulting in pathologic changes in nutrient absorption, digestion, and metabolism. The stress response to critical illness is further influenced by pre-illness metabolism and nutrition status.²,³ It is well established that preexisting malnutrition can be a major determinant of patient response to intensive care unit (ICU) therapies.⁴⁻⁷ Irrespective of nutrition status, current evidence supports the provision of nutrition therapy early and throughout the course of critical illness.⁴,⁸

<a id='f15593cc-ab28-4182-a38b-0412ea54e0a5'></a>

The physiologic route for delivery of nutrition is via the GI tract and is preferred even during critical illness states. Nutrition delivery using the GI tract is not only physiologic and cost efficient but also helps to maintain mucosal integrity through modifying the microbiome and decreasing the risk of bacterial translocation, which can exacerbate the

<a id='6e787009-7d70-4dea-9cdd-43db66fd9add'></a>

course of critical illness. Studies of critically ill children who received enteral nutrition (EN) early in the course of illness demonstrate association with tolerance of feeds, decreased intensive care and hospital lengths of stay, decreased need for mechanical ventilation, reduction in the rate of acquired infections, and overall improved outcomes. 4,8–11

<a id='a568744d-48f2-4503-8c52-7ec655f00584'></a>

The decision of when to initiate nutrition involves recognition of the pre-illness nutrition status and keen understanding of the multifactorial dynamic changes that occur during critical illness. Initiation and assessment of nutrition during critical illness requires a team of professionals. The registered dietitian (RD) plays a key role together with the physician, nurse, pharmacist, and parents/caregivers of the child to optimize prescription, delivery, and monitoring of nutrient intake.<sup>12</sup> Using a team-based approach, nutrition therapy during critical illness aims to meet both baseline metabolic needs to promote growth while simultaneously counteracting the stress response to illness to support a positive nitrogen balance and preserve lean body mass.<sup>2,3</sup>

Assessment of Nutrition Status

<a id='39c20b7b-3dad-4cbb-9b48-d46911fbdae7'></a>

**General Principles**
A comprehensive nutrition status assessment is the first step and key component to optimizing nutrition therapy during critical illness. The RD plays a key role in nutrition assessment to facilitate accurate and appropriate nutrient prescription. 12 Full dietary and medical history should be obtained as soon as possible following pediatric ICU (PICU) admission to facilitate early initiation of nutrition therapy. Current pediatric nutrition screening tools can be helpful as part of a general nutrition assessment and screening to examine patients at risk for nutrition deterioration. 13 However, these tools have not been validated in critical illness.

Anthropometry

<a id='e4555084-5971-459b-a046-814bdd5124d7'></a>

Traditional anthropometric measurements, consisting of weight, length, and head circumference, should be obtained as soon as possible upon admission to the PICU to facilitate assessment of the child's nutrition status and guide delivery of care. Additionally, mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) is a measure of combined muscle and fat mass and may be used as a proxy for fat stores and muscle accretion. MUAC is considered more sensitive to changes in muscle and fat mass and less sensitive to fluid shifts in critically ill states. 14

<a id='d25eb052-60b9-40be-84e9-1b57277866a9'></a>

No published standards exist to define optimal frequency for obtaining anthropometric measurements in critically ill children. The clinical status of the patient, essential therapies, and unit- or hospital-specific standards typically guide the frequency of obtaining anthropometric measurements during critical illness. Factors to consider include the following:

<a id='1985ef84-f0c6-4e44-a962-103aedd0dc1a'></a>

* Weight may be measured daily but may also be obtained less frequently (weekly to several times per week) and must be interpreted with caution, as this parameter is easily influenced by patient age, clinical status, and changes in fluid balance due to resuscitation and fluid shifts, fluid administered, and use of medications, including diuretic agents.
* Stature/length/height should be assessed at least monthly or more frequently based on clinical concerns especially in very young infants and children.
  * Length is measured in children less than 2 years of age.
  * Height is measured in children equal to or greater than 2 years (if clinically appropriate). Note: Many critically ill children are unable to stand for a height measurement, and alternative methods to obtain height may be necessary.
* Critically ill children with contractures or other skeletal deformities (eg, scoliosis) require alternative measures for stature measurement (forearm length, knee–heel length, upper arm length, arm span, etc). These must be obtained by trained personnel who are experienced with these measurements (see chapter 1, “Nutrition Screening and History”).
* Head circumference (also referred to as frontal–occipital circumference) should be obtained every 2 weeks in children up to 3 years of age (or more frequently with specific clinical indications or concerns) because this is an important clinical indicator for brain growth and associated abnormalities (eg, hydrocephalus from raised intracranial pressure).
* MUAC can be used to characterize growth and nutrition status and to monitor body composition, using the child as their own control.14
  * MUAC can be used in special circumstances, including, but not limited to, body edema (particularly lower extremity), ascites, and steroid therapy.
  * MUAC should be obtained by RDs or other trained personnel experienced with these measurements.

<a id='2cfdfb6d-3378-47ac-aaa8-20f768cf5997'></a>

The critical illness state poses several challenges to obtaining accurate anthropometric measurements:

* severity of illness,
* competing priorities,
* time of day,
* patient clinical state and device challenges (weight),
* safety concerns,
* patient contractures and limb anomalies (stature), and
* medical devices (weight, length, and head circumference).

<a id='39e4a1a4-ed93-40c4-8767-87f97dc49d87'></a>

Serial assessment and monitoring of clinical severity and risk for nutrition deterioration should be conducted.

# Malnutrition
Malnutrition is a severe imbalance (either deficiencies or excesses) between nutrient requirements and intake manifesting as cumulative alterations of energy, protein, fat, and micronutrients, negatively impacting growth and development¹⁵ (Table 11-1; see also chapter 2, “Malnutrition,” Table 2-1). Malnutrition can be classified as acute or chronic malnutrition¹⁵:
* Acute: Typically severe and sudden in onset, less than 3 months
* Chronic: Develops and increases in severity over an extended timeframe (3 months or longer)

Malnutrition is associated with immune system dysfunction leading to increased risks of infection, postoperative complications, impaired wound healing, and development of pressure injuries with overall greater morbidity and mortality. Critically ill children are at increased risk for malnutrition during PICU admission. The reported prevalence of malnutrition in the PICU population ranges from 7.2% to 65%,¹⁶ with the widespread range being due to pre-illness nutrition status, patient age, and the parameters and standards used for assessment.¹⁴,¹⁷

<a id='acfa749b-0c51-469c-be9d-52e5dae37ec0'></a>

### Biomarkers/Laboratory Assessment

There are no biomarkers specific to clinical GI function available for measurement during critical illness. The visceral proteins, serum albumin

<a id='2830610c-ddb3-4f9f-b419-374ee4c9d42a'></a>

and prealbumin, should not be used or interpreted as nutrition markers as they do not specifically and independently reflect nutrition status during acute critical illness states. 18 These laboratory values correlate to a greater extent with inflammation and may have an association with the overall clinical status.

Implementation of Nutrition Plan and Monitoring

<a id='83ef8957-081d-46bc-afb7-a07e3253f2a4'></a>

**Nutrition Prescription**

Prescription for nutrition therapy should be adequate and individualized to meet energy, protein, and fat requirements to satisfy the metabolic needs of the critically ill child. Clinical status and severity of illness must be considered when prescribing nutrient intake, which will often vary individually by patient. In general, sedation, neuromuscular blockade, or therapeutic hypothermia decrease metabolic demand, whereas persistent fever, seizures, and paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity will increase metabolic needs. For example, the mechanically ventilated patient who is treated with sedation and/or neuromuscular blockade will typically have less energy requirements than the patient treated with noninvasive ventilation support. In contrast, the neurologically impaired patient with autonomic dysfunction and episodes of “storming” often experiences periods of substantial increase in energy expenditure. Similarly, patients with sepsis and uncontrolled inflammation may have increased metabolic needs.

<a id='c9dba401-c1f1-40ef-827f-fba7dedbe1a7'></a>

The RD must work with the clinical team to determine appropriate nutrient intake over the course of illness. The clinical status of the child will dictate these needs and may fluctuate throughout the PICU stay, resulting in need to titrate prescriptions for nutrition therapy.

<a id='1c636023-4ad6-4ecf-8b27-34ee7712071d'></a>

Indirect calorimetry (IC) is a noninvasive, per-breath measurement of respiratory gas exchange (oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production) to determine energy use. 19 IC is considered the gold standard to determine energy expenditure. The output of IC measurements can be used to facilitate individualization of the nutrition prescription. Limitations to IC use include the following:

<a id='8017bfdd-b4e4-49ec-9e42-0abec89e4dc2'></a>

* FiO2 greater than 0.60
* Presence of air leak (eg, pneumothorax, uncuffed endotracheal tube or tracheotomy, inability to capture all exhaled gases)
* Levels of positive end-expiratory pressure; greater than 10 cm of water
* Changing dynamics of clinical status

<a id='fe9887a8-4871-4433-9d05-c9f4e124f31d'></a>

Considerations for IC use are as follows:
* Cost of equipment
* Need for trained operators
* Accurate interpretation of serial measurements
* Alignment of output with clinical status of the patient
* Knowledge regarding application of these measurements for appropriate decision-making to modify nutrient prescription.

<a id='fd6d7cde-4e5c-4c5a-b72e-c461985859bb'></a>

Current nutrition intake guidelines recommend use of the Schofield
equations²⁰ or WHO²¹ equations to determine energy needs when IC is
not used or unavailable⁴,²² (details available in chapter 4, “Infant to
Adolescent”). Nutrition therapy prescriptions should be reassessed
serially in critically ill children because energy and nutrient needs often
dynamically fluctuate over the course of illness, reflecting the state of
inflammation and injury. Exogenous protein intake is necessary to
prevent muscle degradation, minimize catabolism, limit negative nitrogen
balance, and prevent loss of lean muscle mass.

<a id='cfcecd0d-9c80-4f80-94ae-9ae42e703529'></a>

Current ASPEN/Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) guidelines
recommend a minimum of 1.5 g/kg/d for protein intake in critically ill
children.4 The clinical status may dictate the need for higher levels of
protein intake to prevent and/or reverse negative nitrogen balance and
support wound healing. Infants and children up to 2 years of age require
an intake of 2-3 g/kg/d.23

<a id='44c86b50-ac35-4965-9147-fec3932cabb8'></a>

**Nutrition Delivery**

EN is the preferred delivery method, because it is physiologically most appropriate based on clinical status. Placement of a nasogastric tube for feedings is common practice in the PICU. Care must be taken to ensure proper placement and tube location verification, both at initial placement and at regular intervals to confirm that proper tube placement is maintained. Feeding into the stomach is the preferred approach to

<a id='a21af094-a340-42a7-9848-cb54b8cebe2c'></a>

enterally delivered feeds but may be affected by other factors including
risk of gastric reflux and pulmonary aspiration in critically ill
children. 4,24

<a id='8d83f048-2eef-4757-bf64-fea7ae318141'></a>

Findings from a recent study of mechanically ventilated critically ill children suggest that intermittent gastric feedings are well tolerated in comparison with continuous gastric feedings. Target energy and volume intake were safely attained within 18 hours of feeding initiation in the intermittently fed group and slightly earlier than children receiving continuous gastric feedings.²⁴

<a id='6a2c3ee4-88ed-4491-a520-100d3a00e6b9'></a>

Postpyloric/transpyloric feedings may be more appropriate when there is evidence of delayed gastric emptying or concern for pulmonary aspiration as judged by the clinical team. Limitations of post/transpyloric feeding include accurate placement of the postpyloric/transpyloric feeding tube (ideally in the distal duodenum or jejunum) and time to tube placement (which may delay initiation of enteral feeds). Numerous methods exist for successful post/transpyloric placement, but they require trained personnel and often necessitate patient transport to radiology for use of fluoroscopy to facilitate tube placement. Electromagnetic devices and ultrasonography are increasingly more useful to facilitate placement of post/transpyloric feeding tubes.

<a id='679f3ca2-0aba-4d02-af05-8c53b1d04ef2'></a>

Postpyloric/transpyloric feeds must be administered continuously because the duodenum and jejunum are not anatomically designed as a reservoir. Monitoring for symptoms of "dumping syndrome" with occurrence of hypoglycemia as feeds are initiated is important. Once EN is initiated, many patients also require initiation of a bowel regimen to facilitate regular bowel movements. Considerations for EN in hemodynamically unstable children who are treated with vasoactive medications include type of medication, dose, and evidence of GI tract dysfunction. Patients requiring vasoactive medications may benefit from EN because it may play a protective role by stimulating blood flow, enhancing gastric emptying, and decreasing risk of bacterial translocation. 25,26

<a id='c220aea4-9e74-41b5-a6a3-a97b0f98f130'></a>

Monitoring tolerance of EN is vital for a successful approach to using EN in critical illness. No specific global definition exists for EN

<a id='650ed012-ed37-4613-8854-5405625acf46'></a>

intolerance. Symptoms of EN intolerance requiring investigation and

Use of a systematized feeding algorithm/guideline/pathway can help
facilitate an organized approach to the initiation and advance of EN. Such
an approach is associated with increased EN delivery, decreased EN
interruption, and improved patient feeding tolerance. 4,28–30

Parenteral nutrition (PN) is not recommended as the major source of nutrient intake in the initial 24 hours of critical illness/admission.
However, PN may be necessary in the following circumstances:

*   EN is contraindicated (eg, abdominal operation, trauma).
*   Anticipated delay for initiation of EN beyond 3-5 days.
*   Supplementation of EN with PN is necessary to meet all metabolic needs.
*   Timing and route of PN initiation depends on the patient's clinical status:
    *   Consider at day 3 if moderate to severe malnutrition is present.
    *   Consider at day 4-5 for patients in whom enteral feeds are unable to advance to meet minimum nutrition needs.

Special Considerations

**Postsurgical Nutrition**

Poor nutrition status is associated with suboptimal postsurgical outcomes.25,31 Surgical intervention subjects the child to physiologic stress, organ function disruption, and transient or prolonged alteration in energy requirements. It is therefore imperative that the nutrition assessment and preparation for surgery occur as early as possible in the course of illness. It is necessary to identify and correct derangements and optimize the child's clinical status prior to surgical intervention. Considerations for the child undergoing surgical intervention include the use of the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery guidelines to limit surgical stress and enhance treatment and therapies supportive of nutrition therapy25:

<a id='7ae47f58-c523-4dcc-976a-0e9cd4f79567'></a>

* Preoperative oral or enteral feeds for as long as possible
* Intraoperative modified use of opiates and increased use of regional anesthesia to promote the early resumption of oral or enteral feeds.
* Postoperative early reintroduction of oral or enteral feeds to mitigate catabolism following surgery
* Use of a bowel regimen as appropriate

# Burns

Thermal injuries are characterized by hypermetabolic and hypercatabolic states associated with dramatic losses in lean body mass especially in children.32 There is an acute increase in energy expenditure and protein metabolism in the early phase following burn injury with negative protein balance that persists as long as 9 months after the initial injury. Early nutrition initiation within 24–48 hours of the burn injury is paramount to counter the catabolic state. EN is the preferred mode of nutrition therapy and can be delivered continuously and safely without interruptions even during intraoperative periods for skin debridement and grafting. PN

<a id='400c0aca-3928-437d-a5b0-8c957e01a603'></a>

should be used if EN is not tolerated or is inadequate to meet energy and protein needs.

<a id='ed5d8ab6-cd14-4ae2-99d7-0f206c4ea354'></a>

Hyperglycemia is common and may require administration of insulin infusions to maintain an optimal strategy of glycemic control to minimize complications. Typically, energy needs often exceed 1.5 × basal metabolic rate and protein needs usually exceed 2.5 gm/kg/d³² (see Table 11-3). Children with major burns should receive the following vitamin supplementation³³:

* Vitamin A: 5000–10,000 U daily
* Vitamin C: 250–500 mg twice daily
* Zinc: 100–220 mg daily
* Multivitamin supplementation

In situations with resistant hypercatabolism, pharmacologic adjuncts such as recombinant growth hormone, beta-blockers, and anabolic steroids may be used.

***Extracorporeal Life Support***

<a id='a59b2945-07af-497a-8de5-302f6b2db7be'></a>

Children supported with extracorporeal life support and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) experience variable total energy expenditure (TEE). Contrary to belief that ECMO is a hypermetabolic state with increased TEE, many children are either hypometabolic (33%) or experience normal metabolism (30%).34 An individualized approach to prescription and delivery of nutrition is desirable.

<a id='a89696b9-54a1-4d4a-ac0f-4ff2506a22ac'></a>

Measurement of TEE is challenging because IC cannot be easily used with ECMO. Predictive energy equations are often imprecise in this setting. Alternative methods such as respiratory mass spectroscopy, bioelectricalimpedance analysis, and dilution techniques with isotopes have been explored to assess energy expenditure but are not widely validated.35 Current guidelines lack consensus on energy and protein requirements in children supported on ECMO. In general, ASPEN guidelines for nutritiontherapy in critically ill children are extrapolated to this setting because most children on ECMO are supported with invasive mechanical ventilation and/or vasoactive agents.

<a id='8acbc709-dafa-4d63-9622-1122314b138f'></a>

The impact of ECMO on micronutrients is unclear. Circuit losses of essential amino acids (EAAs), such as isoleucine, and other nutrients, such as calcium, vitamin A, and vitamin E, are common. ECMO patients requiring continuous renal replacement therapy experience micronutrient losses such as vitamins B1, B6, B9, C, and trace elements (especially selenium). EN should be initiated within 24–48 hours of ECMO therapy initiation and often requires PN for supplementation of energy and nutrient needs because of numerous barriers to EN initiation and advancement. Barriers include
* challenges with device insertion for delivery of EN,
* contraindications such as ongoing resuscitation,
* severe hemorrhage with suspected or proven GI ischemia, and
* feeding intolerance.

<a id='f0a31fa4-2069-4fa3-afe2-8df96b7f55bf'></a>

The use of a center- or facility-specific feeding/nutrition guideline in consultation with the RD is highly recommended for nutrition therapy for patients on ECMO. In the absence of standardized guidelines, frequent monitoring of nutrition status and assessment of efficacy of nutrition therapy are essential in pediatric ECMO to optimize metabolism and improve overall outcomes. Each center should establish its own

<a id='c32e42a9-2002-4bb0-a9a6-7feceb21ff46'></a>

guidelines and provide recommendations to closely follow these patients,
including the use of alternative measurements, such as MUAC, because
of difficulties with obtaining weights in these patients.

**_Nutrition Therapy for Pressure Injury and Wound_**
**_Management_**

Macro- and micronutrient intake is necessary to maintain skin integrity to protect against foreign microbes and noxious substances and prevent pressure injury (PI). PI is defined as localized damage to the skin and underlying soft tissue. In critically ill children, the incidence of PI ranges between 10% and 27% and can be as high as 43%. A multidisciplinary comprehensive approach to care involving physicians, surgeons, nurses specializing in wound care, and the RD is ideal to address PI and wound management in critically ill children.36,37

<a id='32455924-8154-4853-9341-382be90340d2'></a>

PIs are staged according to severity, with a scale of 1–4, with 4 being the most severe and having the greatest protein needs. PIs occur because of intense and/or prolonged pressure with or without shearing of the skin:
* Often over a bony prominence
* May be related to medical or other necessary devices

<a id='b8adf78e-d1a9-4660-b9c3-90449e9fb5b8'></a>

Malnourished children—both underweight and overweight or with obesity—are at increased risk of PI, particularly during critical illness. Adequate energy delivery is needed to attain and maintain positive balance to support protein use for collagen and nitrogen synthesis. Protein requirements in critically ill children are increased compared with healthy states. When PI or wounds are present, protein intake will need to exceed the current ASPEN/SCCM minimum recommendation of 1.5 g/kg/d during critical illness to support positive nitrogen balance and anabolism.⁴

<a id='ea180a84-3c06-4dfe-9843-3b8ee7f2b5e6'></a>

Comorbidities affecting protein metabolism and use such as acute kidney injury and other organ dysfunction must be taken into consideration. Fluid requirements may need to be increased if surface areas of wounds are large and there is a moderate-large degree of insensible losses from wound drainage.38

<a id='86d8e615-1eea-49e2-ac01-1d68531c8503'></a>

Micronutrients for management of PI and wounds³⁶ (Table 11-4) include the following:

* Zinc—a mineral: Vital role in wound healing, cell division, immune function, and synthesis of DNA and RNA
* Vitamin C—an antioxidant: Key role in fatty acid transport, collagen synthesis, neurotransmitter synthesis, prostaglandin metabolism, and nitric oxide synthesis; poor wound healing may indicate deficiency
* Vitamin A—an antioxidant: Role in collagen synthesis, gene transcription, and cell and tissue differentiation; deficiency may impair wound healing
* Iron—a mineral: Essential for skin health; necessary for collagen synthesis, red blood cell production; risk for iron deficiency anemia, with transition from iron-fortified formula to cow's milk
* Arginine—EAA: Role in collagen synthesis and immune modulation that may contribute to wound healing
