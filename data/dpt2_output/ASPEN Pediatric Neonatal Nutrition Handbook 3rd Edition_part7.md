# Introduction

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multisystem genetic disease caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (*CFTR*) gene. *CFTR* encodes the CFTR protein. Dysfunction of this protein leads to impaired transport of sodium and chloride across the epithelium and cell membranes. This leads to abnormally thick mucus, which causes impairment in functioning of organs such as the lungs, pancreas, liver, gallbladder, and intestines.¹

<a id='c7c3ade1-1692-4887-b4cd-f3364e8885b7'></a>

Patients with a CF diagnosis are at risk of malnutrition secondary to increased metabolic demand, pancreatic insufficiency, chronic infections, pulmonary exacerbations, and feeding disorders. 1,2 Optimal nutrition status is strongly correlated with pulmonary function and survival. To prevent malnutrition in these patients, it is important to screen these patients for malnutrition and include a diet that is high in energy, fat, and protein to meet the increased energy demands if needed. Treatment also includes pancreatic enzyme supplementation and supplementation of vitamins and micronutrients. 1

Assessment and Nutrient Requirements

<a id='f3328274-274d-4db1-af44-c4431b6ac767'></a>

*Frequency of Assessments*
Infants should be assessed monthly until they are 1 year of age and then every 3 months. Children can be assessed more frequently if they are malnourished.²

<a id='c2bb0cdc-d98f-4796-9027-ce330151d20c'></a>

_**History, Physical Examination, and Assessment**_

A careful history review, examination, and evaluation are critical for all patients with cystic fibrosis to ensure appropriate nutrient provision.

* History: 24-hour dietary recall, assessment of appetite, feeding problems (picky eating, family mealtimes), assessment of malabsorption (stool frequency and consistency), adherence to pancreatic enzymatic replacement therapy, and intake of fat-soluble vitamins
* Nutrition-focused physical exam
* Anthropometric assessment: Weight for age, head circumference (up to 2 years of age) length/height, weight for length, body mass index [BMI]) and assessing muscle mass by assessing lean BMI.
* Laboratory and imaging: Annual assessment of fecal elastase¹; bone mineral density examination by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, which should be assessed after 8–10 years of age³; and fat-soluble vitamin and iron studies annually. ¹,²

<a id='69f806e0-4e3b-45c5-877b-fe996862ab10'></a>

**Goals**
The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation recommends weight for length higher
than the 75th percentile for age by 2 years of age (World Health
Organization growth charts) and BMI greater than or equal to the 50th
percentile for age for children more than 2 years of age (Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention growth charts).¹

Implementation of Nutrition Plan and Monitoring

<a id='b8391574-d409-49de-95b9-e053f30690cb'></a>

_**Nutrition**_

Traditionally, a well-balanced, high-energy, high-protein, high-fat diet has been encouraged in patients with CF. With the advent of CFTR-modulator therapy, patients have demonstrated decreased energy

<a id='9a935bc8-9de4-44ef-ab25-1c795c89844b'></a>

expenditure. Thus, patient will need an individualized plan to meet their nutrition needs.3

<a id='868b38ce-00a1-49f8-855c-67d9fe6b0e80'></a>

## Increasing Energy Provision

Increasing fat additives, frequency of meals and snacks, and increasing calories in general through energy-dense foods is recommended if the patient's weight for length or BMI are not meeting goals.¹ Appetite stimulants can be used if decreased oral intake is the underlying barrier. Enteral nutrition (EN) can be implemented, if patient fails to meet goals despite high-energy foods, addressing mealtime behaviors, and treatment of malabsorption. The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation recommends using nocturnal enteral tube feeding and encouraging oral intake throughout the day.¹ For infants, human milk or infant formula is recommended. Fortification of breast milk or infant formula can be implemented if there is slow weight gain.¹ During solid food introduction, pureed meats are recommended early because of their higher content of protein, zinc, and iron. Early introduction of eggs and nuts is helpful as well.¹ Barriers to achieve optimal nutrition including small bowel bacterial overgrowth, gastroesophageal reflux disease, constipation, and CF-related liver disease and should be addressed. Evaluation of CF-related diabetes (CFRD) should be considered. Undiagnosed CFRD can contribute to poor weight gain, faltering linear growth, and decreased pulmonary function.

<a id='cca14641-e633-46be-9476-2ee64da4495c'></a>

**Essential Fatty Acids**

Foods high in linolenic acid and monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats should be encouraged. Children with CF are at risk of essential fatty acid (EFA) deficiency due to pancreatic insufficiency. Dietary sources like vegetable oils and cold-water fish are rich sources of essential fatty acids. EFA deficiency can be assessed by triene/tetraene ratio if there are concerns for deficiency.¹

<a id='744cadd7-8c14-46ec-830c-2ddc3dc6e9af'></a>

**_Sodium Supplementation_**

<a id='14e20b9d-2127-4a25-8ae9-fe78324c5ff8'></a>

Salt supplementation is recommended because of high sodium losses.
Infants should be supplemented with 1/8 teaspoon of salt until 6 months
of age and 1/4 teaspoon from 6 to 12 months of age. After 1 year of age,
a high-salt diet should be encouraged.

<a id='64c50b81-003b-4943-b243-5fff8bb8c342'></a>

In warm environments or during exercise, salted sports drinks or adding 1/8 teaspoon to 12 oz of sports drink should be used to combat sodium losses.²

<a id='509623a3-1e2c-48ac-9af4-041ad698cb1b'></a>

*Vitamin Supplementation*

Patients with CF are at risk of fat-soluble vitamin deficiency because of fat malabsorption. Vitamin supplementation should be guided by actual laboratory values rather than the patient's age (Table 12-1).4

_**Zinc Supplementation**_

Fat malabsorption can also cause zinc deficiency. The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation recommends zinc supplementation for 6 months (dose of 1 mg elemental zinc/kg/d) in infants and children with poor growth.²

<a id='5f3571af-66ba-4c05-884d-cc73dcc70f1d'></a>

***Pancreatic Enzyme Supplementation***
In cases of severe CF mutations identified by newborn screening, pancreatic enzyme supplements can be started even without confirmation of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.

<a id='d97a89b5-bb8c-41db-bd29-8b9bb2ddef68'></a>

Currently, FDA-approved preparations are enteric coated to prevent damage from gastric acid degradation (Creon, Abbvie, Inc.; Pancreaze, Vivus Inc; Zenpep, Nestlé Health Science; Pertzye, Digestive Care, Inc). Pertyze is bicarbonate buffered, which leads to better release in case the gastric environment is too acidic.

<a id='81a6e772-a875-4790-b34f-9d62aec713f1'></a>

For infants and young children who cannot swallow capsules,
capsules can be opened and placed directly into the mouth or mixed with

<a id='5e5d7cca-9c61-49f9-aac2-bd2480bc9592'></a>

a small amount of acidic food like apple sauce or prepared baby foods
like pears. The food should be soft and not require chewing. Non-
enteric-coated tablets like Viokace are typically not recommended first-
line intervention for enzyme replacement and should be taken with an
acid blocker. The tablets can be crushed into a fine powder and added
directly to the formula.

<a id='106e4708-bec6-452f-95ba-2742bf10156b'></a>

Enzyme-containing cartridges like Relizorb or Alcresta contain only pancreatic lipase and are used with continuous EN. Enzyme dosing is usually based on the weight of the child, or the amount of total fat consumed. Dosing for replacement with enteral formula is usually recommended by the total amount of fat in the diet in the enteral formula (Table 12-2).

# Introduction

Good nutrition is the cornerstone of health and well-being for all children, whether they are typically developing or have neurological impairment (NI).¹² It is the most important tool in our rehabilitation toolkit and a powerful prognosticator of survival in children with NI (Table 13-1).³⁴ For this section, NI will be used as the collective term to describe a large and heterogeneous group of children, many of whom have special nutrition requirements.

The challenges in achieving good nutrition status require creative solutions, which will vary in different jurisdictions depending on resources, supports, and team structures. The concerted effort and advocacy of all multidisciplinary feeding team members, families, and school staff is often required to ensure a safe feeding/eating environment for children with NI in all settings.

## Assessment and Nutrient Requirements

Given that nutrition status has such an impact on health and well-being in children with NI, it is important to evaluate it thoroughly. A comprehensive history of cooccurring conditions that affect nutrition is

<a id='4824c89c-0da2-4827-b022-dcbebcd08ddb'></a>

required at the beginning of a nutrition assessment. Some considerations are outlined in Table 13-2.

*Tools, Anthropometric Measurements, and Nutrition Targets in Children With NI*

Once the history has been taken and there is a good understanding of a child's intake and needs, the clinical assessment and anthropometric measurements need to be integrated with the history information to develop a nutrition care plan. Table 13-4 addresses these and nutrition targets for children with NI. For more detailed information, see also chapter 1, "Nutrition Screening and History."

## Implementation of Nutrition Plan and Monitoring

<a id='4adb515c-49d0-4b41-8368-83e4fec85bba'></a>

***Designing Diet Plans for Children With NI***
Many of the considerations required in developing appropriate diet plans for children with NI are imbedded in the information gleaned from the

<a id='7f880c80-309e-4c84-a3dd-60456a0d2615'></a>

nutrition assessment, the nutrition targets for children with NI, and the red flags for malnutrition.

<a id='32742016-15c8-40a9-8d29-9dfc1fa2e32e'></a>

Oral nutrition rehabilitation involves increasing a child's caloric and nutrient intake and improving the feeding/eating process itself. See the references and Table 13-6 for considerations to optimize oral feeding. 5,6
Similarly, enteral nutrition (EN) also requires the optimization of nutrient intake; however, the challenges experienced by oral feeding are replaced by problems related to skin management, enteral access devices, and feeding tolerance. Families often experience decisional uncertainty regarding gastrostomy tube (GT) placement; however, they have high satisfaction rates once the GTs are in place. Children generally have improved nutrition indicators and better health with the initiation of EN.7

# Introduction

In both type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), a variety of genetic, environmental, and other factors result in the progressive loss of beta-cell function, which results in hyperglycemia; however, the first line of treatment and treatment modalities may differ.

<a id='c297c4e1-b6fb-4a2e-9a70-6557a6665b9b'></a>

**Types of Diabetes**
T1DM is an autoimmune disease that results in a complete loss of beta-cell function, which results in elevated glucose levels and requires the administration of insulin for food consumption and maintenance of euglycemia. T2DM is a disease that results from insulin resistance due to declining beta-cell function, which is exacerbated by puberty and obesity in children. The progression in decline of β-cell function is much more rapid in youth with T2DM than T1DM or adults with T2DM, which is associated with higher risks for comorbidities than children with T1DM¹.
Symptoms of diabetes include polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, dehydration, weight loss, electrolyte disturbances, vision changes, fatigue, acetone-smelling breath, and vomiting². The onset of these symptoms is much more rapid in the T1DM population, occurring over

<a id='177ed714-9e82-42b2-a4cf-1c14632d367b'></a>

weeks or months, whereas in patients with T2DM, it may develop over
months or years.

_**Hemoglobin A1c and Goal Blood Glucose Ranges Based on Age**_

The hemoglobin A1c test is an indirect measure of a 90-day average glycemic control of an individual and may be influenced by other factors, such as blood cell turnover.2–3 Refer to Tables 14-1 and 14-2.

b HbA1c targets should be set in accordance with guidelines and consideration of
individual and family factors. It may adjust to a higher goal based on many individual
factors, such as toddlers or children who cannot articulate symptoms of hypoglycemia
(<7.5%) and those who have frequent severe hypoglycemia (<8%). Additionally, it may
be lowered (<6.5%) if a patient can reach the goal without significant hypoglycemia, a
significant burden on the child and/or family from the intensity of the regimen.

**Assessment and Nutrient Requirements**

In children with T1DM and T2DM, calorie needs are typically calculated on initial diagnosis. Few studies have assessed whether the caloric needs of children or adolescents with diabetes differ from the general population; thus, it is recommended to use the dietary reference intake (DRI) incorporating the individual's growth patterns, food history, physical activity, and nutrition-related laboratories. 5,6

<a id='29ee5941-2981-4701-8296-8f244b5b1d94'></a>

For children who are overweight and obese, attaining a body mass index (BMI) below the 85th percentile can help increase insulin sensitivity and decrease the risk for comorbidities. It should be noted that obesity rates in children with T1DM are the same as those of the general population.7 Refer to chapter 25, "Weight Management and Obesity," for estimating calorie needs for the overweight/obese population.

<a id='c5d3cf85-e06c-4bbe-9d49-adad74647777'></a>

Carbohydrate intake should be equivalent to the acceptable macronutrient distribution range of 45%-65% of estimated caloric needs being divided between meals and snacks. “Low-carb” diet is not well defined throughout the literature, making it more challenging to study, and is not well studied in pediatrics; thus, it is not recommended. A minimum of 130 g of carbohydrates per day is recommended and 14g

<a id='006a6ff6-676b-4441-81d4-b2f688c1e525'></a>

dietary fiber per 1000kcal.8,9 Emphasis should be placed on increasing intake of complex carbohydrate foods and limiting foods high in added sugars, particularly sugar-sweetened beverages. Education should be provided regarding the quality of the fat source10 and avoidance of overconsuming fat products to decrease consumption of carbohydrates.4,8,11

<a id='924a127b-f370-4b11-9146-d4a09e60b2fb'></a>

Protein, fat, and fluid needs do not differ from the average pediatric
population, and the DRI is recommended unless otherwise indicated. 10
Refer to chapter 16, "Dislipidemia" for the distribution of fats from the
diet.

Implementation of Nutrition Plan and Monitoring

<a id='1de4b1d2-3a56-45e1-9ebb-5b36e4b2ec19'></a>

**Assess for Food Insecurity and Social Determinants of Health**

These will impact nutrition education and/or delivery of information, including how to overcome these barriers, should they exist.

* Use the Hunger Vital Signs tool, which is validated in the pediatric population. 12
* Refer to social worker or case manager for assistance and/or resources.

<a id='cb880e1e-7db0-48aa-b26b-e05d4ec9b5d8'></a>

**Nutrition Support**

Use the age-appropriate formula as indicated by the patient's other medical conditions because a “diabetic" formula is not necessarily indicated.13 Subcutaneous insulin injections may be used to match the feeding regimen.14 In acute states, patients may have increased insulin resistance13 and may require working with the endocrinologist on adjusting insulin regimen.

It is important to consider the difference between simple verses
complex carbohydrates that contain fiber. Also consider the impact of
protein and fat on postprandial glucose rises. Sugar alcohols (polyols) are
not fully absorbed from the small intestine into the blood and therefore
have a lower impact on glucose levels than other sources of

<a id='aed025d0-4997-4984-ad0f-c743fb706eb3'></a>

carbohydrates; they may cause a laxative effect if consumed in large amounts (>20 g), especially in children. 15

<a id='b3294f43-d1b8-42e7-a515-27e3f646e2aa'></a>

For insulin dosing of foods that contain high fiber (>5 g) or sugar alcohols (>5 g), subtract half the fiber and/or sugar alcohols from total carbohydrates and dose for the remainder. 16 Dosing rules should be further discussed with the dietitian and physician on follow-up visits. Encourage limiting “snacking” between meals, even if carb free, to prevent excessive weight gain.

<a id='6d436757-c645-4caf-85d7-27cd3ceb6017'></a>

## Medications

For those on mealtime insulin, it is important to educate on dosing rapid or fast-acting insulin 10–15 minutes before the meal to prevent significant glucose rises postprandially. In certain circumstances (eg, toddlers or picky eaters), midmeal dosing may be appropriate and should be discussed with the diabetes team. Refer to Table 14-5 for details regarding the types of insulin.

# Exercise

For children and adolescents, encourage 30–60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous–intensity exercise daily in addition to strength and bone strengthening training at least 3 days per week. Limit non-academic screen time to 2 hours per day. 17

<a id='a049bc82-eeaf-416e-b360-bb4396e74637'></a>

For adults (>18 y), encourage 150 minutes or more of moderate-to-vigorous-intensity exercise per week, with no more than 2 days in succession without activity. In younger, healthy individuals, shorter durations of high intensity or interval training of \u2265 75 minutes is

<a id='b116e87f-a3cb-4bc6-bd0e-ef8850dcddad'></a>

acceptable. Moderate-to-intense exercise should be delayed if glucose
levels are ≥ 350 mg/dL [19.4 mmol/L]) and/or the child has moderate-to-
high urine ketones.17

<a id='85f21937-e2eb-4b6b-92d3-a8df6c37e667'></a>

A plan should be customized to promote euglycemia during exercise. For those on insulin, consumption of a carbohydrate- and protein- containing snack before or during activity can prevent hypoglycemia with physical activity. 18 In children with T2DM on oral medications, the risk for exercise-induced hypoglycemia is rare.

<a id='92baeb20-2a74-4482-9a9e-7e1da23c73e9'></a>

Weight Management. For children and adolescents 18 y, weight loss of 7%–10% body weight is suggested if BMI ≥ 85th percentile, however there is conflicting evidence to support this.⁴ For adults≥ 18 y, supporting weight loss of 15% is recommended.⁴

# Introduction

Disordered eating and eating disorders are often underdiagnosed disease states that affect many youths, adolescents, and young adults. Because of the secrecy and many of the signs and symptoms of disordered eating or an eating disorder, it may be difficult to identify; many cases go undetected and underdiagnosed. Although sources differ greatly, it is estimated that 30 million individuals are battling eating disorders in the United States, many of which have comorbidities with mental health illnesses.¹

<a id='dfdaab44-45ac-40f4-b4f5-3ed47fc40297'></a>

This chapter reviews the classification, diagnosis, assessment, general
etiology, therapy and treatment strategies, and interdisciplinary teamwork
and monitoring, including reviewing for refeeding syndrome and
planning for a continuum of care.

<a id='cb776980-bb44-4c78-a0e3-354bd92827b1'></a>

**Classification and Diagnosis of Disordered Eating**
The American Psychiatric Association recommends using a multiaxial system in the assessment and diagnosis of mental disorders and lists subcategories under "Feeding Disorders" in the *Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition* (Table 15-1).1–4
These may be associated comorbid mental health illnesses.2,4,5

**Assessment and Nutrient Requirements**

Establishing trust and rapport is vital to proper assessment and successful treatment with a nonjudgmental approach in interviewing. It is recommended to speak in low tones and calmly, maintain a nonthreatening posture, avoid surprise or showing disappointment, speak firmly but with empathy, gauge eye contact to match the patient, monitor nonverbal cues and body posture of the patient, ask open-ended questions, and allow time to respond because cognition can change or slow with malnutrition and starvation. 1,2,6

<a id='f787d5b6-abe9-4cf3-92a9-55de7706af0f'></a>

During the assessment process, the clinical practitioner should assess for signs and symptoms of malnutrition along with a thorough nutrition-focused physical examination (NFPE; Table 15-2). Additional information should be gathered on weight and development of not only the patient but also the history of the family, if available, to include in the assessment and treatment.¹ It should be noted that most often patients with anorexia will have normal test results for albumin levels.

***Macronutrient Requirements***

For patients with anorexia nervosa, estimated energy requirements are
30–40 kcal/kg of current body weight; with thermogenesis this may

binge eating disorder, energy requirements for weight maintenance are around 1.2–1.3 kcal/kg per resting energy expenditure.¹ Protein requirements are the same as the recommended dietary allowance and are calculated based on ideal body weight (IBW), and fat should make up 25%–30% of calories.¹

# Implementation Plan and Monitoring

Disordered eating is a complex process, and it is important that any protocol is adjusted based on patient factors including the patient's medical condition, cardiac and laboratory status, or probability of refeeding and prior intake.7-9 The following protocol is recommended unless your hospital policy/program dictates otherwise.

The laboratory assessment at presentation includes the following:
* Complete blood cell count
* Electrolytes, including magnesium, phosphorus, and calcium
* Glucose
* Zinc
* Ferritin, iron-binding capacity, and iron saturation
* 25-hydroxy vitamin D
* Thiamin

_**Nutrition Support Plan**_

When developing the nutrition support plan, the IBW should be used
(estimated 50th percentile for age/sex with consideration for height). The
estimated IBW may need to be adjusted during treatment. 4-7 Goals for
weight gain depend on program or hospital policy and the medical status
of the patient (while managing refeeding syndrome if present). Most
sources support a goal of 0.5-1.0 lb/wk for weight gain. 1,3,4

Recommendations for initiation and advancement of nutrition support in patients with disordered eating are outlined in Table 15-3. Energy provision should start at 20–40 kcal/kg/d of current body weight initially with an advance of 200 cal every other day if tolerated. Some resources suggest starting as low as 5 kcal/kg/d in extremely high-risk cases.
