# SELF-ASSESSMENT #1

A 54-year-old thin female (51 kg, 5'5") with a history of short bowel syndrome requiring her to be on long-term PN for the past 10 years is informed by her homecare pharmacy there is a national shortage of IV multivitamins. Which of the following doses of IV multivitamins would be MOST appropriate to use in this patient?

A. Continue same 10 mL daily dose until the supply is exhausted
B. Only provide 10 mL on Mondays each week
C. Only provide 10 mL on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays each week
D. Switch to standard dose of oral multivitamin 3 days per week

# SELF-ASSESSMENT #2

A 69-year-old diabetic male with bowel obstruction from colon cancer is to be sent home on PN. During the cycling of his PN in the hospital, he has required 30 units of regular insulin to be added to his PN to maintain glucoses in the 130-150 mg/dL range. One week after discharge, his caregiver reports his finger stick glucose readings have been in the 60-80 mg/dL range. What is the most likely reason for the change in his glycemic control?

A. Stress of being hospitalized has resolved and his insulin needs are lower.
B. His HPN formulation was incorrectly compounded with less dextrose than in the hospital.
C. He is not receiving his HPN daily as instructed.
D. He has received more insulin than prescribed.

- PN product shortages have occurred since 1988
  - Mostly isolated to IV multivitamins
    - Deaths from thiamine deficiency resulting in refractory lactic acidosis
  - 2010-2011 shortages resulted in almost every PN component used
    - FDA regulations, inspections, recalls, issues with raw materials, demand, loss of manufacturing sites and quality issues
- Substitute PN products must be evaluated for compatibility/stability with other ingredients in PN admixtures. Carefully identify therapeutic equivalents:
  - Communicate information to clinical staff
  - Prioritize patients and manage inventory

MANAGING PN PRODUCT SHORTAGES – AMINO ACIDS

*   Amino acids shortage strategies:
    *   Reserve high (e.g., > 10%) concentration amino acids for fluid-restricted PN patients
    *   Review entire portfolio of amino acids products available nationally
        *   Other concentrations may be available (e.g., 8.5%)
    *   Different brands of amino acids products are not always substitutable
        *   Different pH, calcium-phosphate solubility, amounts of phosphate and other electrolytes (e.g., sodium, acetate, chloride)
    *   Compound in a single, central location to decrease inventory waste
        *   Evaluate need for each amino acid product on ACD

    * Home or long-term patients on PN

  - Critically ill patients on PN receiving propofol do NOT require additional ILE for EFAD prevention
    * Propofol is formulated in 10% soybean oil ILE
  - Consider using an alternative ILE containing soybean oil
  - Monitor PN patients for risk of developing EFAD

▪ Commercially available ILEs are stabilized with egg yolk phosphatides providing a mechanical and electrical barrier to particle coalescence
▪ Phospholipid mixture imparts negative surface (anionic surfactant) charge on emulsified lipid particles and prevents coalescence by inducing electrostatic repulsion
  – Addition of cations to a TNA neutralize the negative charge on the surface of the lipid particles and lead to loss of the electrostatic and mechanical barrier created by the anionic surfactant
    • Monovalent = Sodium + Potassium
    • Divalent = Magnesium + Calcium
    • Trivalent = Iron dextran (greatest impact on destabilization)

        *   Described as dense white color at the top of a TNA
    *   Heavy creaming occurs prior to "cracking" where the oil globules coalesce on the surface and separates from water in the TNA
        *   Unsafe for infusion if heavy creaming or "cracked" marbled appearance in TNA visible
            *   Oil globules > 5 microns in size pose the risk of pulmonary embolism

  – Dual chamber bags may also be required in the home setting
• Unstable TNAs may only reveal visual evidence of "cracked" oil droplets 65% of the time
  – Visual assessment is only available in most pharmacies
  – Light obscuration analysis can detect unstable TNAs 90% of the time
    • Not routinely available

- Oil-in-water emulsion cracking more likely to occur at pH ≤ 5
  - Addition of monohydrated dextrose (pH ~4) directly to an ILE (pH 6-9) can contribute to instability
- Amino acids are considered to provide a protective effect by enhancing the TNA's buffering effect and reducing probability of coalescence
  - ILEs do not possess pH buffering capacity
  - Hydrolytic degradation of triglycerides forming free fatty acids can lower the pH over the course of an ILE shelf life

■ Mean droplet size of commercially-available ILE is between 0.2-0.5 microns
- Particulates are common in most large volume injectables
  * Foreign particles can produce phlebitis
    - Peripheral > central venous access
- Microprecipitates may lead to catheter occlusion
  * Solubility of calcium & phosphate is not entirely predictable
- 1.2 micron in-line filter will reduce these problems and can filter microorganisms (e.g., *Candida albicans*)
  * Should be used for no longer than 24 hours

PROCESS AND EDUCATION OF
HOME PN

<a id='cd6f896e-c1d0-40f2-9e60-5bb99d32773c'></a>

<::The image displays a process diagram illustrating the transition of a patient requiring PN (Parenteral Nutrition) from hospital to home care. 

At the top, "PN Indication Central Venous Access" is shown with two arrows pointing outwards: one to "Hospital Acute Phase (< 7 days)" on the left, and another to "Home Chronic Phase (≥ 7 days)" on the right.

The process is depicted as a U-shaped flow, starting from the hospital phase and moving towards the home phase.

On the left side, under "Hospital Acute Phase (< 7 days)", the following boxed elements are listed vertically:
- Refeeding Syndrome
- Electrolyte Stabilization
- Glucose Tolerance
- Fluid Assessment Needs

As the process moves from the hospital phase, it transitions through several steps at the bottom of the U-curve:
- Education begins
- Caregiver Identified
- Homecare Company Selected
- Cycling

An upward-pointing arrow, labeled "Discharge" in yellow text, signifies the transition from the acute phase to the chronic phase, leading towards the home setting.

On the right side, under "Home Chronic Phase (≥ 7 days)", the following boxed elements are listed vertically:
- Home Evaluation
- Psychosocial Issues

In the bottom right corner, the text "NUTRITION SUPPORT CERTIFICATE" is displayed.

Which of the following doses of IV multivitamins would be MOST appropriate to use in this patient?

A. Continue same 10 mL daily dose until the supply is exhausted
B. Only provide 10 mL on Mondays each week
C. Only provide 10 mL on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays each week

# SELF-ASSESSMENT #2

A 69-year-old diabetic male with bowel obstruction from colon cancer is to be sent home on PN. During the cycling of his PN in the hospital, he has required 30 units of regular insulin to be added to his PN to maintain glucoses in the 130-150 mg/dL range. One week after discharge, his caregiver reports his finger stick glucose readings have been in the 60-80 mg/dL range. What is the most likely reason for the change in his glycemic control?

A. Stress of being hospitalized has resolved and his insulin needs are lower
B. His HPN formulation was incorrectly compounded with less dextrose than in the hospital
C. He is not receiving his HPN daily as instructed
D. He has received more insulin than prescribed

CONCLUSIONS

*   PN product shortages will continue to occur in the U.S. and pharmacists are ideal to share management strategies with other healthcare professionals and patients.
*   Inline use of a 1.2 micron filter is required of all TNAs given the risks of compatibility and stability.
*   Calcium & phosphate final concentrations (_incorporating phosphates from all sources_) must be below amino acids brand-based solubility curves.
*   Education of HPN consumers and their caregivers is an on-going endeavor to provide the safest therapy.
