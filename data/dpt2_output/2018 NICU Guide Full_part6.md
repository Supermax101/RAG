c. Length of enoxaparin therapy: Length of therapy should be tailored based on observation of clot resolution, but is also tempered by the underlying condition. A recent prospective analysis of newborns and infants suggested that length of therapy ranges from 2-6 wks. Consult pediatric hematology! Therapy may be extended if follow-up ultrasound shows persistent thrombus.

Janene H. Fuerch M.D.

I. **Definition:** Thrombocytopenia is defined as a platelet count under 150,000/µl. It is classified as mild (100-150 X 109/L), moderate (50-99 X109/L), and severe (<50X 109/L).

<a id='fe0bcfbc-6b73-4ff9-8dde-b452cfb69f87'></a>

**II. Etiology:**

A. If the infant is sick, preterm or has medical complications consider:

1. Sepsis (bacterial, viral)
2. Necrotizing Enterocolitis
3. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC)
4. TORCH infections
5. Birth asphyxia
6. Inborn error of metabolism (e.g. propionic academia and methyl-malonic academia)

<a id='8f5af2d8-a6a3-45be-aab3-e44bea64635e'></a>

B. **If the infant is well appearing and has no congenital anomalies or dysmorphic features consider:**

1. Maternal pre-eclampsia: Evidence suggests thrombocytopenia is due to disruption of hematopoietic progenitor cell commitment to megakaryocytopoiesis.
2. Maternal autoimmune thrombocytopenia: The diagnosis should be considered in any infant with thrombocytopenia with a maternal history of either ITP or an autoimmune disease with or without thrombocytopenia. Infants should get a screening platelet count after birth. If the platelet count is normal no further evaluation is necessary. If there is mild-moderate thrombocytopenia then it should be repeated in 2 to 3 days, as the platelet nadir may not be achieved until 6 days after birth. If the platelet count is less than 50X10⁹/L despite a platelet transfusion, then administer IVIG (1g/kg X 2 days). In cases of active bleeding random donor platelets should be given.
3. Neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (NAIT): Early-onset (<72 hours) marked thrombocytopenia in a well appearing neonate is suggestive of immune thrombocytopenia caused by antiplatelet antibodies from the mother to the fetus. It occurs when fetal platelets contain an antigen inherited from the father that the mother lacks. There are sixteen Human Platelet Antigens (HPAs), but only three cause 95% of the NAIT cases (HPA-1a, HPA-5b, and HPA-15b). Infants can have mucocutaneous bleeding. 10% develop intracranial hemorrhage. Unlike Rh disease, NAIT develops in the first pregnancy and likewise future pregnancies can also be affected.

<a id='1bfa38e3-306f-4868-8e87-5064e3e69b6d'></a>

C. If the neonate has physical abnormalities or dymorphic features consider:

1. Kasabach-Merritt syndrome: Platelets are sequestered in a vascular malformation (hemangiomas), leading to thrombocytopenia.
2. Trisomies (3, 18, 21, or Turner syndrome).
3. Fanconi anemia: Form of aplastic anemia associated with a variety of congenital anomalies, such as abnormalities of hand (hypoplastic or absent thumbs) and the genitourinary system.

246 Part II-D: Hematology

4. TAR (thrombocytopenia absent radius) syndrome: An autosomal recessive disorder characterized by thrombocytopenia and skeletal abnormalities of the radius. Bilateral agenesis of radii is the most common. Congenital heart disease particularly ASD and TOF may be seen.

<a id='61f93616-1683-4032-999e-09eaa28848d7'></a>

### III. Approach

A. Confirm the platelet count with a repeat sample from a peripheral vein and also careful review of the peripheral smear.

B. Review maternal history for PIH, pre-eclampsia, HELLP syndrome, IUGR, ITP, SLE, maternal medication or a previous sibling with thrombocytopenia.

C. Is the neonate term, preterm or IUGR?

D. Is the neonate well appearing or sick? Thrombocytopenia can be the first presenting sign of a serious infection. Sepsis has to be ruled out in both preterm and term neonates with moderate to severe thrombocytopenia who are ill/well appearing.

E. Congenital anomalies or dysmorphic features?

F. Bruising, mucosal bleeding or petechiae?

G. If NAIT is suspected then blood should be collected from father and mother for confirmatory testing. Antigen screening should include HPA 1, 3, and 5. If this is negative then HPA 9 and 15 (HPA 4 for Asian descent) should be obtained. Imaging of the brain (US or CT or MRI) is mandatory for NAIT. Random donor platelet transfusions are first line of therapy. If patient is stable transfuse for platelet count <30X10⁹/L. If there is evidence of intracranial hemorrhage maintain the platelet count >100X10⁹/L. Once NAIT is confirmed or suspected, intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) 1g/kg for up to 2 consecutive days is recommended. If this does not increase the platelet count then matched platelets should be transfused. The condition resolves in about 2 weeks.

<a id='647772c1-1617-44d4-8415-e815dd78975d'></a>

IV. **Platelet transfusion guidelines**

A. Transfuse platelets to preterm neonates (<33 weeks) and to clinically unstable term infants during first postnatal week for platelet counts below 50X10⁹/L.
B. After the first postnatal week, the threshold can be lowered to 30X10⁹/L in clinically stable infants. Neonates should receive 10-15ml/kg of platelets

Suspected Sepsis in Newborn Infants 253

**Suspected Sepsis in Newborn Infants**

<a id='772532bf-6f36-4b79-81af-ad4757ffcec3'></a>

William Benitz, M.D. and Arun Gupta, M.D.

Suspected sepsis may be the most common working diagnosis in neonatal medicine. Bacterial infection is confirmed by positive blood cultures in only about 1 in 1000 newborn infants, but this strict criterion probably underestimates the true burden of disease. Signs of neonatal bacterial infection are nonspecific and sometimes subtle. Delays in antibiotic therapy may permit progression to respiratory failure, septic shock or meningitis. These concerns have prompted an aggressive approach to identifying, evaluating, and treating infants at risk.

<a id='76d8aea9-dbb6-41df-8a07-21cc41937660'></a>

# I. Management Principles

Our approach to management of infants is based on three core principles:

A. Prevent infection whenever possible
B. Identify and treat bacterial infection early and consistently
C. Focus or stop antibiotic therapy as soon as possible

Strategies for pursuit of these goals are outlined below.

<a id='d6464c00-d8c9-471d-82c5-3a637953fb46'></a>

II. **Classification of Neonatal Sepsis**

A. **Early-Onset Sepsis**

Early-onset sepsis is defined as invasive bacterial infection occurring in the first 3 days after birth. Early-onset sepsis is strongly associated with perinatal risk factors (Table 1) and almost always results in clinical signs of illness within the first 24 hours after birth. The bacteriology of early-onset sepsis is summarized in Figure 1.

254 Part II-E: Infection

**B.** Hospital Acquired Late-Onset Sepsis

a. Hospital acquired infection (HAI), including late-onset sepsis, is defined as invasive bacterial infection occurring on or after day 4 after birth through discharge from the hospital. HAI are associated with indwelling vascular catheters, prolonged parenteral nutrition, postnatal steroid exposure (including hydrocortisone), suppression of gastric acid secretion (H2 blockers and PPIs), prematurity, prolonged antibiotic use, and surgical conditions. The risk of HAI can be mitigated by adoption of the CLABSI prevention "bundle", minimizing exposure to antibiotics, steroids, and antacid medications, and facilitating the transition from parenteral to enteric nutrition. The bacteriology of hospital acquired late-onset sepsis is summarized in Figure 2.

C. Community Acquired Late-Onset Sepsis

Community acquired late-onset sepsis is defined as invasive bacterial infection occurring on days 4 through 28 after birth in previously well infants after discharge from the hospital. Community acquired sepsis is not strongly associated with perinatal risk factors. Late-onset GBS sepsis is associated with prematurity, lack of maternal opsonizing antibodies, and maternal GBS colonization, but late-onset GBS sepsis is not prevented by intrapartum or perinatal prophylaxis. The bacteriology of community acquired late-onset sepsis is summarized in Figure 3.

### III. Prevention of Neonatal Infections

<a id='21ce33b7-6429-409c-b277-dd682287cad2'></a>

A. Early Onset Sepsis

The landscape for Early Onset Sepsis has changed, and what was once a frequent occurrence now has an incidence of about 0.3-1.0 per 1000 live births. This is likely due to the impact of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis which has been very successful in prevention of early-onset GBS sepsis (Figure 4).

<a id='5e6be430-1ae4-4bc5-9943-73738e706003'></a>

Figure 4. Impact of intrapartum prophylaxis on early-onset group B streptococcal sepsis.
<::chart: The chart is a line graph showing the trend of early-onset and late-onset group B streptococcal sepsis cases per 1000 births from 1990 to 2010. The y-axis is labeled "Cases per 1000 births" and ranges from 0.0 to 2.5. The x-axis is labeled "Year" and ranges from 1990 to 2010. Two lines are plotted:
- A solid line with circular markers represents "Early-onset disease". This line starts around 1.75 cases per 1000 births in 1990, fluctuates slightly, peaks around 1.8 cases in 1993, then shows a general decline, especially after 1996, reaching approximately 0.25 cases per 1000 births by 2010.
- A dashed line with square markers represents "Late-onset disease". This line remains relatively stable, fluctuating between approximately 0.3 and 0.5 cases per 1000 births throughout the period.

Several events are marked on the timeline with arrows:
- 1990: "Group B Strep Association formed"
- 1992: "ACOG and AAP statements issued"
- 1995: "CDC draft guidelines published"
- 1996: "Consensus guidelines issued"
- 2001: "Revised guidelines issued"
- 2010: "Revised guidelines issued"::>

**B. Hospital Acquired Late Onset Sepsis**

Adoption of the CLABSI prevention "bundle" and assiduous attention to minimizing antibiotic days in our nurseries have substantially reduced the number of hospital-acquired infections in our inpatient population, with reduced rates of coagulase-negative *Staphylococcus* bacteremia and *Candida* fungemia, in particular.

**C. Community Acquired Late Onset Sepsis**

No strategies are known to be effective for prevention of community acquired late-onset neonatal infections.

<a id='bbd75e5a-a3d5-4c37-91e5-c7ff8b4dc365'></a>

IV. **Diagnosis of Neonatal Sepsis**

A. Sepsis should be suspected in babies with the risk indicators or clinical findings listed in Table 1. Essentially any sign of illness in a newborn infant may be an indication of bacterial infection.

B. Treatment for suspected sepsis has traditionally been based on risk factors (such as those listed in Table 1). However, for _asymptomatic_ term infants with perinatal risk factors (including but not limited to chorioamnionitis), the risk of early onset sepsis is low. Thus, it is no longer necessary to automatically treat well-appearing late-preterm (> 34 weeks) or term infants based on risk factors alone. Clinical signs of illness have been found to be more useful in the diagnosis of early onset sepsis as most neonates with early onset sepsis will become ill within 6-12 hours of birth.

1. Some risk factors, such as chorioamnionitis, may warrant the need for closer monitoring after birth (which can be accomplished via frequent serial exams or continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring) in order to determine if there are any clinical signs of illness in the infant.

2. Although some risk factors may be associated with increased risk for early-onset sepsis, none have sufficient sensitivity to allow reliance on them for either negative or positive predictive value. Universal monitoring of all newborn infants for at least 24 hours after birth with frequent focused examinations is a much more reliable strategy for identifying infants who may be infected.

C. The diagnostic evaluation of infants with suspected sepsis includes both indirect and definitive indicators of infection. The former consist of measurements of the inflammatory response, such as blood counts and measurement of serum acute phase reactant levels (e.g. CRP, procalcitonin, IL-6). These tests are notoriously unreliable for early diagnosis of sepsis. The performance of standard hematological measurements (note low sensitivity and PPV) is shown in Table 2. Acute phase reactants, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) are similarly insensitive early in an infection, as shown in Table 9 (see below).

There is little evidence that screening tests add to serial examinations every 2 to 4 hours over the first 24 hours after
birth. That approach (which should now be our practice at LPCH) is now an accepted alternative.

D. Definitive diagnosis of neonatal sepsis requires cultures, which should be obtained from each of the following *nonpermissive* sites:

- blood, whenever antibiotics are initiated or changed to broaden antibacterial coverage

- endotracheal aspirates, from babies with respiratory distress and a pulmonary infiltrate who are newly (1-2 days) intubated

- urine, in neonates > 72 hours of age

- cerebrospinal fluid, in neonates with clinical signs of illness or a positive blood culture

1. Blood Cultures - True-positive blood cultures are very likely to be positive after incubation for 36 hours (Figure 6A); those reported as positive after 48 hours of incubation are likely spurious, so 36 hours is sufficient for detection of 95% of true-positive results (Garcia-Prats, Pediatrics, 2000).

2. Tracheal cultures - Cultures of tracheal aspirates are valuable adjuncts to blood cultures in infants with respiratory distress and pulmonary infiltrates (Sherman, Pediatrics, 1980). In 3 to 4% of these patients, tracheal aspirates will yield the only bacteriological diagnosis (a positive tracheal culture with a negative blood culture; Figure 6B). Tracheal aspirate cultures therefore should be sent upon intubation of such infants, but intubation solely to obtain cultures is probably not justified. Tracheal aspirate cultures are not useful in infants who have been intubated for more than a day or two (even if the endotracheal tube has been just replaced), as those cultures reflect only bacterial colonization of the chronically instrumented airway. The one exception to this is that tracheal colonization with Candida is strongly associated with development of disseminated disease within the following week, and should be treated.

3. Urine cultures - Urine cultures obtained in the first 72 hours after birth are unlikely to produce additional diagnostic information; fewer than 1% of infants evaluated will have an isolated positive urine culture (Visser, J Pediatr, 1979). Specimens obtained in older infants are likely to be informative, however, as urine will be the sole source of bacteria in about 5% of them (Figure 6C). Collection technique for urine cultures is critical. Bacterial culture of "bag" specimens is useless in neonates; false-positive cultures are extremely frequent and they cannot be distinguished on the basis of low colony counts or isolation of a single bacterial strain (since heavy colonization with a single or strongly dominant strain is very common as infants acquire normal superficial microflora). Specimens obtained by urethral catheterization are better but are also often spuriously positive. Suprapubic aspiration (SPA) is the strongly preferred method for urine collection for culture in neonates; results of these cultures are rarely ambiguous, as the presence of any organisms is abnormal. SPA should be performed to complete a sepsis evaluation if urethral catheterization is unsuccessful or not feasible.

4. Cerebrospinal fluid - CSF should be obtained in any infant with clinical signs of illness or positive blood cultures. CSF culture provides the only bacteriological diagnosis in 15-50% of infants with meningitis (Wiswell, Pedatrics, 1995) (Figure 6D), so the specimen should be obtained before or very soon after initiation of antibiotic treatment. It is unlikely that truly asymptomatic infants will have meningitis, so lumbar puncture can be deferred in well appearing infants undergoing evaluation unless there is a positive blood culture. If the CSF specimen is obtained after the initiation of antibiotic therapy, CSF cell counts and chemistries must be relied upon to diagnose meningitis and determine the required length of therapy (see below). Normal ranges for CSF findings in neonates are summarized in Table 5. Bacterial meningitis is characterized by elevated WBC counts (predominantly granulocytic), low glucose levels, and high protein levels.

Use of cefotaxime rather than gentamicin for early-onset neonatal sepsis is associated with higher mortality rates (Figure 7), so gentamicin is the preferred agent (along with ampicillin). Currently, there is a manufacturing shortage of cefotaxime. If a third-generation cephalosporin is desired, ceftazidime should be ordered.

Cefotaxime should be considered (either instead of or in addition to gentamicin) in sick preterm infants whose mothers have received multiple antepartum antibiotic doses (because of the increased risk of resistance in _E. coli_ isolates; Figure 8) and for infants with meningitis (because of superior penetration into the CNS and CSF).

<a id='dc7958b6-95ab-4421-a32c-285e9cd038e0'></a>

Signs of skin or soft tissue infection, endocarditis, or osteomyelitis should raise concern for possible *Staph. aureus* infection and receive antibiotics tailored to treat this pathogen. For these instances of localized infection, vancomycin is the preferred *initial* drug until methicillin resistance is ruled out.

<a id='cdab69fa-8506-4f53-a100-602bd49d10fc'></a>

B. Adjustment of Treatment

If changes are made to antibiotic coverage because of an unsatisfactory response to empiric therapy, the new antibiotics should be chosen to ensure coverage of resistant Gram-negative enteric bacilli (consider meropenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftazidime, cefipime, or aztreonam) and Staph. aureus (consider

vancomycin). Remember that third-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems do not provide good coverage for *Listeria* or *Enterococcus*, and aztreonam does not cover *Listeria*, *Streptococcus* or *Enterococcus*.

<a id='8d9963b9-ac85-4dce-9cae-939f2f1aa160'></a>

Isolation of the causative organism from a nonpermissive site (see above) should prompt immediate narrowing of antibiotic coverage focused on the recovered bacterial isolate. Recommended responses to selected isolates are outlined in Table 7.

Coverage for anaerobic organisms is rarely necessary in neonates. Because newborn infants (preterm infants < 7-14 days and term infants < 3-4 days of age) are rarely colonized with anaerobes, anaerobic infections are rare and appear to be well tolerated. Coverage for anaerobic organisms may be appropriate for older infants with bowel perforation and peritoneal soiling; clindamycin or metronidazole are appropriate agents.

<a id='6e1c4915-4f2f-4eea-b43c-5042578a1814'></a>

When results of antimicrobial sensitivity become available, antibiotic coverage should be adjusted to use the most selective, least expensive, and (usually) oldest effective drug.

<a id='5538ea65-12cd-4e76-9737-e6c9ac411326'></a>

Certain isolates, including coagulase-negative *Staph*. (in the first few days after birth), diphtheroids, *Corynebacterium*, and *Propionobacterium*, are likely spurious and can be ignored.

C. Duration of Treatment

1.  Treatment can be discontinued when:
    -   it has been determined that the infant was not infected, or
    -   an effective course of therapy has been completed
2.  Exclusion of sepsis depends upon absence of ongoing clinical signs of sepsis, negative culture results, and reassuring ancillary laboratory test results. A framework for decision making is provided in Table 8.

Infants who are well appearing and have negative laboratory tests (including cultures) and those with positive cultures are the easy cases (no treatment or a full course of treatment, respectively). Well infants with negative culture results, in general, should also have antibiotic treatment stopped. Sick infants with negative cultures and normal CRP levels should have antibiotics discontinued, based on the excellent negative predictive value of serial normal serum CRP levels (obtained 8-24 hours after the initial evaluation and again 24 hours later); those results reduce the probability that the baby was infected by 85% or more (Table 9). Sick infants with negative cultures and elevated CRP levels represent the most difficult case; blood cultures may be negative in up to 40% of infants who are bacteremic, so negative cultures alone may not be reassuring. However, the positive predictive value of an elevated CRP is also low. Thus, these cases will require careful thought and clinical judgement.

Suspected Sepsis in Newborn Infants 263

The data provided in Table 9 support the utility of CRP levels for retrospective exclusion of sepsis, they do not support use of CRP levels for screening early in the course of illness (note the low sensitivity of CRP #1 for both early- and late-onset sepsis). Similarly, the positive predictive value for early-onset culture-proven sepsis of elevated CRP levels is modest (Figure 9). Elevated CRP levels therefore should not compel prolonged treatment of suspected early-onset sepsis; they merit more concern in late-onset cases (Figure 9B). An elevated CRP level with negative blood cultures, especially in an asymptomatic baby should prompt a search for nonbacterial causes of CRP elevation (Table 10)

Figure 9. Positive predictive values of CRP levels for early- (A) and late-onset (B) proven (open bars) or proven/suspected sepsis (solid bars).
<::chart: Two bar charts, labeled A and B, display the positive predictive values of C-Reactive Protein (CRP) levels for early-onset (A) and late-onset (B) sepsis.
Both charts share the same Y-axis, "Positive Predictive Value," ranging from 0.0 to 1.0, and the same X-axis, "Maximum Serum C-Reactive Protein Level in the 2 Days Following Initial Evaluation (mg/dl)," with categories: 0-1, 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6, 6-7, 7-8, 8-9, 9-10, and >10.
Each category on the X-axis has two bars: an open bar representing "proven sepsis" and a solid bar representing "proven/suspected sepsis."

Chart A (early-onset):
The positive predictive value for proven sepsis (open bars) remains relatively low across all CRP levels, showing a slight increase from approximately 0.0 at 0-1 mg/dl to around 0.2 at >10 mg/dl.
The positive predictive value for proven/suspected sepsis (solid bars) shows a clear increasing trend with higher CRP levels, starting from approximately 0.02 at 0-1 mg/dl and reaching 1.0 at >10 mg/dl. The solid bars are consistently higher than the open bars for corresponding CRP levels.

Chart B (late-onset):
The positive predictive value for proven sepsis (open bars) generally increases with CRP levels, starting from approximately 0.0 at 0-1 mg/dl, reaching a peak around 0.8 at 8-9 mg/dl, and then decreasing slightly to about 0.5 at >10 mg/dl.
The positive predictive value for proven/suspected sepsis (solid bars) also shows a strong increasing trend with higher CRP levels, starting from approximately 0.0 at 0-1 mg/dl and reaching 1.0 at 8-9 mg/dl, 9-10 mg/dl, and >10 mg/dl. Similar to Chart A, the solid bars are generally higher than the open bars, especially at lower CRP levels, but they converge or are very close at higher CRP levels (e.g., 8-9 mg/dl and 9-10 mg/dl).

There is very little empirical evidence to establish minimum durations of effective treatment, so we must rely upon prior experience with standard treatment intervals.

I. Introduction

A. All preterm infants should receive full doses of recommended vaccinations according to their **chronological**, not adjusted, age. Birth weight and size are not factors in deciding whether to vaccinate a clinically stable preterm infant, except for **hepatitis B** vaccination. Parents should be given written information about each of the vaccines and should sign the vaccine order and "Benefits and Reactions" form **before** immunization is given. Document the vaccines given in the infant's medical record and in the Discharge Summary.

The current recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) can be accessed at:
http://aapredbook.aappublications.org/site/resources/izschedules.xhtml and at
http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6002a1.htm.

B. Hepatitis B vaccine (Engerix B or Recombivax)

1. At birth

a. All newborns should receive monovalent Hepatitis B Vaccine soon after birth and before hospital discharge (for infants <2000g, see table 3.a.).

b. Infants born to **Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive** mothers:

i. **All infants**: administer HepB vaccine and 0.5 mL of hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) within 12 hours of birth

ii. For **preterm** infants weighing **<2000g**, the initial vaccine dose (birth dose) should not be counted as part of the vaccine series because of the potentially reduced immunogenicity of hepatitis B vaccine in these infants; 3 additional doses of vaccine (for a total of 4 doses) should be administered beginning when the infant reaches age 1 month.

iii. Continue vaccine series beginning at 1-2 mo of age according to recommended schedule for infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers (see Redbook schedule Table 3.21).

iv. Check anti-HBs and HBsAg 1-2 months after completion of vaccine series; typically around age 9-18 months. Use a testing method that allows determination of a protective concentration of anti- HBS (10 mIU/mL or greater). See Red Book for interpretation of test results.

c. Infants born to mothers whose **HBsAg status is unknown**:

i. Test mother for HBsAg IMMEDIATELY after admission to L&D.

ii. All infants of mothers with unknown status: administer HepB vaccine within 12 hours of birth.

iii. Term infants **≥2000g**: if mother tests positive for HBsAg or if HBsAg status remains unknown, administer HBIG within 7 days.

iv. Infants **<2000g** if mother tests positive for HBsAg or if HBsAg status remains unknown, administer HBIG within 12 hours.

2. Continue vaccine series beginning at 1-2 mo of age according to recommended schedule based on mother's HBsAg result and birth weight (Red Book Table 3.21).

3. Following the birth dose

a. The Hepatitis B Vaccine series should be completed with either monovalent Hepatitis B or a combination vaccine containing Hepatitis B.

b. The second dose should be administered at age 1-2 mos. Monovalent HepB vaccine should be used for doses administered before age 6 weeks.

c. Although the standard hepatitis B vaccination schedule is 3 doses, administration of a total 4 doses of HepB vaccine is permissible when a combination vaccine containing HepB is administered after the birth dose.

d. The minimum interval between dose 1 and dose 2 is 4 weeks, and between dose 2 and 3 is 8 weeks.

e. The final (3rd or 4th) dose in the HepB vaccine series should not be administered before 24 weeks (164 days) of age and at least 16 weeks after the first dose.

C. Inactivated polio vaccine: Minimum age 6 week

D. Rotavirus vaccine:

This is an oral vaccine that consists of 5 live reassortant rotaviruses. The first dose is generally given between 6-12 wks of age. Fecal shedding of virus occurs in approximately 8.9% of recipients after the first dose. Transmission of vaccine virus from healthy vaccinees to close contacts, especially immunocompromised contacts, has been reported, but the frequency of this event is not known. The safety and efficacy of rotavirus vaccine appears to be similar for pre-term and term infants, but data is limited. We do not currently administer Rotavirus vaccine in LPCH NICU.

1. If a recently immunized infant is hospitalized, standard precautions should be taken to prevent the spread of vaccine virus.

<a id='99705ba9-d619-4fa4-9ed7-7005218abd63'></a>

E. Immunizations to be given at 2 months chronological age:

1.  0.5 ml IM Pentacel (DTaP + HIB + IPV)
2.  0.5 ml IM Engerix B (HepB)
3.  0.5 ml IM Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Prevnar® 13)
4.  Meningococcal conjugate vaccines - Menveo (MenACWY or MCV4) or Menhibrix (Hib-MenCY)
    a.  For children with anatomic or functional asplenia (including sickle cell disease) or persistent complement component deficiency, administer an infant series of Hib-MenCY at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months (Menveo) or 2, 4, 6 and 12-15 months (Menhibrix).
    b.  If Hib-MenCY vaccine (Menhibrix) is chosen to be given to high-risk infants older than 2 months of age, Kinrix (DTaP, IPV) should be ordered instead of Pentacel (DTaP, HIB, IPV).
    c.  Infants traveling to endemic areas for meningococcus should receive Menveo rather than Menhibrix.

I. Introduction

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is the leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection in infants and young children.

A. Risk Factors for Hospitalization

The risk for hospitalization due to RSV infection is greatest in the following patients:

1. Preterm infants born before 29 weeks gestation
2. Infants and young children with chronic lung disease (CLD)
3. Infants with hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease (CHD)

B. Strategies for Prevention of RSV Infection

Strategies to prevent RSV and other viral respiratory infections include offering breast milk feeds, immunizing household contacts with influenza vaccine, practicing hand and cough hygiene, avoidance of tobacco or other smoke exposure, and avoidance of large group child care during the first winter season.

C. Passive Immunoprophylaxis

Data from controlled clinical trials support the efficacy of monthly 15 mg/kg IM injections of the passive monoclonal antibody palivizumab (Synagis®). Studies show reduced hospitalization due to lower respiratory tract illness in patient groups who are at greatest risk for RSV infections.

<a id='c2faef1c-fdb5-4df4-a855-c06bbcc61b96'></a>

## II. Prophylaxis Recommendations

### A. Who to Prophylax

1. Palivizumab prophylaxis is recommended for the following patient categories during the RSV season
   a. Infants <12 months post-natal age **AND** born before 29 weeks, 0 days gestation.
   b. Infants <12 months post-natal age **AND** born before 32 weeks, 0 days gestation **WITH** requirement for >21% oxygen for at least the first 28 days after birth (CLD).
   c. Infants <12 months post-natal age **AND** with acyanotic heart disease on medication to control congestive heart failure **AND** will require cardiac surgical procedures.
   d. Infants <24 months post-natal age **AND** has a transplanted heart, is in need of cardiac transplantation, required ECMO during the current admission for cardiac disease, **OR** required cardiac bypass during the current hospital admission.
   e. Infants <12 months post-natal age **WITH** moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension.
   f. Infants 12-24 months post-natal age **AND** born before 32 weeks, 0 days gestation **WITH** requirement for ≥28 days after birth (CLD) **AND** on chronic systemic corticosteroid therapy, diuretic therapy, bronchodilator therapy or supplemental oxygen in the 6 month period before the start of the second RSV season.

g. Infants ≤24 months post-natal age **AND** listed for **OR** status post solid organ transplant.

2. The following groups of infants with CHD are **NOT** at increased risk from RSV and generally should **NOT** receive immunoprophylaxis:

a. Infants and children with hemodynamically insignificant heart disease (e.g., secundum atrial septal defect, small ventricular septal defect, pulmonic stenosis, uncomplicated aortic stenosis, mild coarctation of the aorta, and patent ductus arteriosus).

b. Infants with lesions adequately corrected by surgery, unless they continue to require medication for congestive heart failure.

c. Infants with mild cardiomyopathy who are not receiving medical therapy for the condition.

d. Children in the second year of life.

3. Palivizumab immunoprophylaxis **MAY** be considered in infants <12 months post-natal age with neuromuscular disease or a congenital anomaly that impairs the ability to clear secretions from the upper airway.

4. There are insufficient data to support the routine use of palivizumab in children with Down syndrome unless qualifying heart disease, CLD, airway clearance issues, or prematurity (<29 weeks, 0 days gestation) is present.

5. Limited studies suggest that some patients with cystic fibrosis may be at increased risk of RSV infection; however, there are insufficient data to support the routine use of palivizumab in this patient population.

6. Palivizumab has not been evaluated in randomized trials in immunocompromised children. Although specific recommendations for immunocompromised patients cannot be made, prophylaxis **MAY** be considered for children younger than 24 months of age who are profoundly immunocompromised during the RSV season.

7. Palivizumab is not effective in the treatment of RSV disease and is **NOT** approved or recommended for this indication.

<a id='2818a9aa-14d5-4bc7-a64e-688f04e0412c'></a>

B. When to Prophylax

1. For qualifying patients, palivizumab administration should **begin in November** and continue for total of **5 monthly doses** (i.e., November, December, January, February, March) to provide protection for the duration of the typical RSV season of November-April.

a. Local respiratory virus activity is monitored weekly by the Integrated Infectious Disease Program. Results in graphic form are published in the LPCH Medical Staff News during the respiratory virus season.

b. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) also monitor outbreaks of respiratory viruses and publishes updates online at http://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/nrevss/rsv/natl-trend.html.

2. Once a child qualifies for initiation of prophylaxis at the start of the RSV season, administration should continue throughout the season. For infants born during the RSV season, fewer than 5 monthly doses will be needed (for example, a child born in December would receive their last dose in March). **Children should not receive more than 5 doses.**

<a id='ed92df90-bf6c-4820-b883-068ed1e61e9b'></a>

3. Patients who qualify for prophylaxis because of CLD, prematurity, or CHD may receive the **first dose**
**48 hours prior to discharge to home** or promptly after discharge.

<a id='1296a7e5-2979-412e-aee4-65eb0819e0f6'></a>

4. Children remaining as inpatients (in any unit) should **NOT** receive palivizumab, even if they meet the above criteria.

<a id='d83baeb4-321a-4050-9066-8164c1570497'></a>

C. Special Considerations

1. A postoperative dose of palivizumab (15 mg/kg) should be considered after cardiopulmonary bypass or at the conclusion of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for infants and children younger than 24 months.
2. If an infant or child who is receiving immunoprophylaxis experiences a breakthrough RSV hospitalization, prophylaxis should be **DISCONTINUED** because of the extremely low likelihood of a second RSV hospitalization in the same season (<0.5%).

<a id='e0f713cb-8446-443c-af47-322ffd4766a3'></a>

D. How to Order

1. Palivizumab administration on an outpatient basis should be coordinated by the patient's primary care provider. MediCal and many insurance companies, HMO, and IPA programs have approved Synagis® for high-risk patients, but individual approval for each patient is required. The patient's insurance will generally determine where and how the patient will receive the treatment. Parents can review education materials on the internet at http://www.rsvprotection.com.
2. Palivizumab is **NOT** indicated for inpatient use and providers will be required to select the appropriate indication for prophylaxis when ordering the drug. Clinicians considering prescribing doses for patients that do not meet the package insert, American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), or institutional guidelines outlined above will be required to contact the Pediatric Infectious Disease Consult service for approval.

I. **Introduction**

A. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) belongs to the same family as cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and varicella zoster virus (VZV). There are 2 types of HSV: HSV-1 is classically associated with oral lesions and HSV-2 with genital lesions. In recent years, an increasing number of cases of genital herpes have been caused by HSV-1. HSV-2 is the most common cause of herpes disease in neonates (75% of cases).

B. The incidence of neonatal HSV infection is estimated to be around 1:3,200 deliveries.

C. HSV is most commonly transmitted from mother to infant at the time of delivery. In some cases, babies are infected after birth when a parent or other individual with active oral or skin herpes kisses or holds the baby. Intrauterine infection is very rare.

D. The risk for HSV transmission to the neonate is greatest in mothers with a primary genital infection near the time of delivery. More than 75% of infants with HSV infection have been born to women with no history or clinical findings suggestive of genital HSV infection before or during pregnancy.

E. It is important to include neonatal HSV infection in the differential diagnosis of the ill neonate. Infection should be considered in neonates with fever, suspected sepsis, negative bacterial cultures, severe liver dysfunction, vesicular rash, seizure, and/or abnormal CSF findings.

<a id='cec056c6-48df-42e5-8000-a18c9907e6bf'></a>

II. **Clinical Presentation**

A. Neonatal HSV infection can manifest as:

1. Disseminated disease involving multiple organs, most commonly liver and lungs

2. Localized central nervous system (CNS) disease, with or without skin findings

1. Localized skin, eye, and/or mouth (SEM) disease

### III. Diagnosis

A. It is ESSENTIAL to ensure the appropriate diagnostic tests are obtained PRIOR to beginning acyclovir. If you have any questions regarding these tests please call the Pediatric Infectious Disease Fellow on call.

B. The diagnostic evaluation for neonatal HSV includes **ALL** of the following

1.  HSV PCR, blood
2.  HSV PCR, CSF
3.  HSV PCR, conjunctivae
4.  HSV PCR, nasopharynx
    Surface Sites
5.  HSV PCR, mouth
6.  HSV PCR, rectum
7.  HSV PCR, lesion (if any lesions/vesicles/pustules concerning for HSV are present)
8.  CBC with differential
9.  ALT
10. CSF protein, glucose, cell count, Gram stain, and culture
11. CXR (for infants with respiratory distress)

C. At LPCH, **ALL** HSV PCR's are orderable as "**HSV DNA PCR Qual**". Please select the specimen type and specimen source as appropriate.

D. Please do **NOT** send an HSV serology.

E. A flocked swab placed in viral transport media should be used for all surface site and lesion PCR's.

F. Please contact the Virology Lab (8-5575) with any questions related to specimen collection.

G. Differential diagnosis includes:

1.  Enteroviral sepsis
2.  Bacterial (e.g., Listeria, GBS, S. aureus, Gram negative) infection

3. Varicella zoster virus infection
4. Symptomatic cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection
5. Noninfectious conditions
   a. Erythema toxicum
   b. Incontinentia pigmenti
   c. Bednar's aphthae

<a id='56ced1af-1a86-426d-b646-4ebf807d2962'></a>

IV. **Treatment**

A. Parenteral acyclovir is the treatment of choice for neonatal HSV infections.

B. The dose of acyclovir is 60 mg/kg/day given IV and divided every 8 hours, regardless of site of infection. This dose may need to be adjusted for infants in renal failure.

C. Duration

1. Skin, eye, and mouth disease: Minimum 14 days
2. Disseminated disease: Minimum 21 days
3. CNS disease: Minimum 21 days
   a. Because the persistence of HSV DNA in the CSF is associated with poor outcome, some experts recommend that the lumbar puncture be repeated near the end of therapy to make sure that HSV DNA PCR is negative and that CSF parameters have returned to normal.
   b. Some experts recommend continuing antiviral therapy and repeating CSF HSV DNA PCR testing weekly until the CSF HSV DNA PCR is negative.

D. Suppressive Therapy

1. Oral suppressive therapy with acyclovir has been shown to improve neurodevelopmental outcomes and reduce the number of skin recurrences in infants with a history of neonatal HSV.
2. **ALL** infants with a history of neonatal HSV should be placed on oral acyclovir suppression, 300mg/m2/dose PO TID, immediately after completing the initial course of parenteral acyclovir.
3. The duration of suppressive therapy is 6 months.
4. At a minimum, it is recommended that an ANC is followed at 2 and 4 weeks after initiating therapy and monthly thereafter.

<a id='7ebab861-e055-49bf-9dc6-945ac40268a3'></a>

5. Prior to discharge, outpatient Pediatric Infectious Disease follow-up should be coordinated for all patients receiving oral suppressive therapy.

Suspected HSV Infection 279

A. Because the risk to infants exposed to HSV during delivery varies in different circumstances (from less than 2% for recurrent genital HSV to 25%–60% for first-episode genital HSV), management of the asymptomatic, exposed neonate is complex and **Infectious Disease consultation is recommended**.

<a id='1315b46b-d1dc-4579-90fc-fc645d4dbc29'></a>

B. In 2013 the AAP published a Clinical Report entitled "Guidance on Management of Asymptomatic Neonates Born to Women with Active Genital Herpes Lesions". In this report there is an algorithm for management of **asymptomatic neonates** born vaginally or by cesarean delivery to women with active genital HSV lesions.

*   This algorithm should be applied only in facilities where access to PCR and type-specific serologic testing is readily available and turnaround time for test results is appropriately short. In situations where this is not possible, the approach detailed in the algorithm will have limited, and perhaps no, applicability.
*   Evaluation and treatment is indicated prior to 24 hours of age if the infant develops signs and symptoms of neonatal HSV disease. In addition, immediate evaluation and treatment may be considered if:
    *   There is prolonged rupture of membranes (>4-6 hours)
    *   The infant is premature (≤37 weeks gestation)
† Conjunctivae, mouth, nasopharynx, and rectum, and scalp electrode site, if present.
‡ HSV blood PCR is not utilized for assignment of disease classification.
§ Discharge after 48 hours of negative HSV cultures (and negative PCRs) is acceptable if other discharge criteria have been met, there is ready access to medical care, and a person who is able to comply fully with instructions for home observation will be present. If any of these conditions is not met, the infant should be observed in the hospital until HSV cultures are finalized as negative or are negative for 96 hours after being set up in cell culture, whichever is shorter.

Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease

<a id='91722f62-0a5d-4dd9-9777-30f19af9ce13'></a>

William Berquist, M.D., and Carol K. Conrad, M.D.

I. **Definition of Gastroesophageal Reflux (GER)**

A. The important mechanism in GER is the transient relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter, which is often accompanied with poor coordination of esophageal motility and allows movement of the gastric content into the esophagus. It is usually unrelated to swallowing and may also be related to delayed gastric emptying in the immature infant.

B. GER is common and physiologic in infants during the first 6 months of life, occurs thirty or more times daily, usually last 3 minutes or less, occurs in the post prandial period, and causes few, if any, symptoms. It is much more common in preterm than term infants. The amount of reflux usually decreases over the first year of life with developmental maturation, upright posture and an increased intake of solid foods.

C. It is controversial when to consider GER pathologic, which is referred to as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). However, there is consensus that it is pathologic when it leads to complications such as **insufficient caloric intake** and **poor growth/failure to thrive (FTT)**, **esophagitis** (uncommon during infancy for the pre- term and full-term infant) and its sequelae (bleeding, anemia, stricture) or *tracheal aspiration*. GERD is present when the reflux of gastric contents causes troublesome symptoms and/or complications.

D. GERD may be associated with feeding problems, such as frequent emesis or nasal-oral regurgitation, feeding aversion, poor weight gain, posturing, grimacing, aspiration, and exacerbation of chronic lung disease.

E. In term infants, GERD may be associated with apnea and airway problems, such as hoarse cry and stridor, due to edema and inflammation caused by the gastric acidity of the reflux. Some infants may present with an "apparent life threatening event (ALTE)", due to the reflux. Clinical problems that have a greater incidence of GERD are infants following repair of tracheao-esophageal fistulae, gastroschisis, and congenital diaphragmatic herniae. Infants with Trisomy 21 also have an increased incidence of GERD.

F. Numerous carefully controlled studies have failed to demonstrate a temporal relationship or association of GER and apnea in preterm infants. Although both GER and apnea occur in the same infant, they tend to be separate events.

<a id='be35a3c9-e002-47d5-8f5f-ce2082aab142'></a>

II. **Diagnosis of GERD**

A. **pH Probe/Apnea Study:** Is the direct continuous measurement of intra-esophageal fluid reflux via impedance probe. The device measures all pH fluid movement at multiple levels. The device combines a single pH probing site that rests in the lower 1/3 of the esophagus, and also detects the presence of that fluid at multiple levels along the length of the esophagus, ideally over a 24-hour period. The current computerized ambulatory system available for clinical bedside studies allows video monitoring along with apnea, bradycardia, oxygen saturation, and intra-esophageal pH and fluid movement collected by a digital recorder. The probe is placed through a nostril with the pH measuring port positioned into the distal 3rd of the esophagus (infant should be NPO 2 hours prior to placement), verified by CXR as needed. The infant can receive either bolus feeds or continuous feeds. The standard values for interpretation are based on acid reflux events, so it may be prudent to place a hold order for H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors (such as ranitidine and omeprazole) for 48 hours, or other medications, which can increase the gastric pH prior to the study. However, if that is medically contraindicated, then the study is still interpretable with the caveat that non-acid events cannot be interpreted with respect to standardized values. To arrange the study, contact the Pulmonary Laboratory. Since the device has several ports for detection of acid or non-acid fluids, Multi-level GER recording is available via the impedance monitor and may be helpful in

detecting GER to the level of the proximal esophagus if reflux esophagitis or aspiration of refluxed contents is suspected. The routine for the NICU is the single level pH recording. Scoring of the recording is based on percentage of reflux time with pH <4, and the frequency and duration of reflux episodes. Baseline data for full-term and pre-term infants are available on the report. The pH probe studies may underestimate the number of refluxes by as much as 30-40% as many episodes are non-acidic, though all events are captured and interpreted within the context of the patient and purpose for the study.

B. Barium Swallow: Demonstrates gross reflux, but is not as sensitive as pH probe in determining reflux activity over 18-24 hours. The UGI can be helpful in identifying anatomic abnormalities and screen for delayed gastric emptying associated with partial upper GI obstruction or gastroparesis.

C. Gastric Emptying Study (Nuclear Medicine): This is used to identify prolonged emptying time and may also detect aspiration of gastric content into the respiratory tree. Esophageal and gastric outlet anatomy are not well evaluated.

D. Esophageal Manometry: This is used to assess LES tone and function and is not generally available for clinical testing and cannot dynamically assess reflux activity over 18-24 hours.

E. GER Impedance: Can record reflux events at multiple levels and may accompany pH (as above). It is useful to detect all reflux events including non-acid reflux events and correlate them to symptoms. Impedence studies lack pediatric control data. There are no standards for this measurement, and it has not been determined if this measurement is more clinically helpful than pH measurement alone. This methodology is currently utilized at the LPCH Pulmonary Laboratory, but continues to be interpreted utilizing the acid reflux standards that have been documented historically. As normal values are collected and published, the weakly acid and non-acid reflux data will be taken into account. Complex studies will be co-interpreted with the GI service.

### III. Non-pharmacologic Treatment for GERD

A. Antireflux positioning: Elevate head of bed 30°, position with left side down (this affects the position of the LES so that it is in a higher position). Prone position is also effective but is counter to the "back to sleep" recommendation known to reduce the risk for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).

B. Thickened feeds: There is scant evidence to support or refute efficacy of thickened feeds in infants with GER.

1. Thickeners may be used to increase the viscosity of formula, breast milk, or other thin fluids for patients with identified swallowing difficulties and risk of aspiration.
2. Thickeners will not be used to thicken foods or fluids unless a swallowing evaluation has been completed and recommendations have been made by the feeding therapist in conjunction with the patient's physician.
3. It is recommended that patients who will discharge to home on thickened feedings receive ongoing inpatient therapy and eventual outpatient therapy to provide ongoing assessment and treatment of a safe feeding plan.

<a id='a209914d-e00f-47eb-9dd6-a2e50887e9f7'></a>

A. Erythromycin ethylsuccinate as a prokinetic

1. Mechanism of action: may improve gastroduodenal contractility in FT and PT infant older than 33 wks GA via the action on the motilin receptors (immature in PT) but has no effect on esophageal motility or on the LES.
2. Dose: 10-20 mg/kg/day PO divided q 6-8 h. Recommend starting with 5mg/kg TID po and make clinical observations which either support improvement in symptoms or consider discontinuing if clinical status worsens.
3. Side effects: Associated with higher incidence of acquired pyloric stenosis and prolonged QTc (see package insert for full list of common and serious reactions). Metabolized primarily in the liver (>90%).

<a id='10ba2887-9987-43eb-bb07-cc6172f6491d'></a>

B. **Ranitidine (Zantac®)**

1.  **Mechanism of action**: H2 blocker used to decrease gastric acidity.
2.  **Dose**: 2 mg/kg/day twice daily PO and may increase to 2 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours. Max dose 6 mg/kg/d.
3.  **Side effects**: constipation, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. It is important to check the gastric pH for effect (pH 5-6).

C. **Omeprazole (Prilosec®)**

1.  **Mechanism of action**: proton-pump inhibitor (PPI). Used for severe cases of GER in which an H2 blocker has not maintained a decrease in gastric acidity. This medication has gained acceptance in our NICU; however, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic data are lacking.
2.  **Dose**: Start at 0.7 mg/kg PO once every day, then may give a 2nd dose 12 hours later if necessary. Dose range 0.2-3.5mg/kg/d. It is important to check the gastric pH for effect (pH 5-6).
3.  **Side effects**: Tachycardia, bradycardia, palpitations, headache, dizziness, insomnia, anxiety, rash, hypoglycemia, and diarrhea.

D. **Pantoprazole (Protonix®)**

1.  **Mechanism of action**: PPI used for severe cases of GER in which H2 blockers have not effectively decreased gastric acidity.
2.  **Dose**: 1 mg/kg PO every 12-24 hrs. Even less is known about pharmacokinetics and pharmaco- dynamics. It is important to check the gastric pH for effect (pH 5-6)
3.  **Side effects**: same as omeprazole.

<a id='88accf22-2fe0-4ddd-8e28-3deceba627f7'></a>

B. Surgical Techniques

1.  **Nissen fundoplication** This involves placing the esophagogastric junction within the abdomen and wrapping the fundus 360° around the esophagus for a distance of 3-4 cm. The fundus is sutured to itself and the underlying esophageal wall. This reliably relieves reflux in 85% of cases. LPCH Surgeons prefer not to do fundoplication in young infants since it seems to have poorer results in that age group.
2.  **Thal repair** This also mobilizes the esophagogastric junction into the abdomen and closes the esophageal hiatus, but forms an anterior wrap of the fundus, encircling only 180° of the esophagus.
3.  **Side effects of surgery** Infant will have limited ability to "burp" to relieve gastric distension via the esophagus.

<a id='a46d3cc8-dee1-42a5-a41a-5c2fffa87877'></a>

VI. Summary

GER/GERD has become a common diagnosis/presumed mechanism for early and late apnea, bradycardia and apnea/bradycardia and oxygen desaturation in the pre-term infant. There is no evidence that this is a clinical phenomenon in preterm infants. Although it is hypothesized that this association should be present due to the recognized "recurrent laryngeal reflex" in immature infants, which can cause respiratory pause and apnea when irritant receptors in laryngeal and peri-laryngeal areas are stimulated, retrospective and prospective studies in preterm infants have not documented this relationship.

<a id='4e43fea0-955d-454a-9547-69ffc7f48e45'></a>

The most common intervention used in the NICU is an H2 blocker or PPI to decrease gastric acidity and increase gastric pH >4. It is important to document that gastric pH is >4 after treatment to verify adequate intervention and to make a concerted effort to document that there is clinical improvement which may be associated with this intervention. If symptoms are due to regurgitation of gastric contents (acid or alkaline) changing gastric acidity may not lead to resolution of clinical symptoms (e.g., with chronic recurrent tracheal aspiration). Data on efficacy of prokinetics is lacking in pre-term infants. If this intervention is used, careful clinical monitoring is again essential. As with all "therapies" there is a risk: benefit ratio and good "intentions" do not ensure that a medical benefit will result for the infant. In general the diagnosis of GER/GERD as the cause of apnea, bradycardia, and oxygen desaturation is over-used in many NICUs and is not substantiated by the evidence.

I. General

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the most common acquired gastrointestinal emergency in the NICU. The estimated incidence of this disease ranges from 1-5% of all NICU admissions; the majority of those affected (>90%) are premature infants. The timing of onset of this disease varies, with "classic" NEC in preterm infants reported to occur after 8-10 days, with mean age of presentation among VLBW preterm infants reported to range from ~10- 25 days with a peak at 32 weeks PMA. However, cases have been reported up to 3 months of age. The presentation of NEC can be insidious, heralded by slowly increasing feeding intolerance, or changes in stooling patterns. Conversely, infants with NEC may present with a sudden shock-like clinical picture and markedly distended and discolored abdomen. Infants may be affected with this illness whether or not they have begun to feed. Variations in numbers of cases over the years suggest "epidemics" can occur, but it is unknown through what mechanism.

## II. Signs and Symptoms

A. Clinical signs are variable, ranging from minor feeding intolerance and guaiac positive stools to profound intra-abdominal catastrophe with shock and sepsis.

B. The "Clinical Triad" of abdominal distention, gastrointestinal bleeding, and pneumatosis intestinalis (air in the bowel wall) is often used to diagnose "definite" NEC. However, NEC may present with abdominal distention and pneumotosis in the absence of gastrointestinal bleeding.

C. Early symptoms include gastric residuals, lethargy, increasing apnea and bradycardia, temperature instability, and poor perfusion (similar to sepsis).

D. Gastrointestinal symptoms range from mild distention, guarding, tenderness, abdominal discoloration, and the suggestion of an abdominal "mass" which may indicate perforation.

E. Radiographic evaluation may reveal distended loops of bowel with:

1. Pneumatosis intestinalis anywhere along the small or large bowel ("bubbly" appearance around the bowel wall or "railroad track")
2. Pneumoperitoneum which is indicative of intestinal perforation
3. Portal venous air which is considered to indicate a rapid progression.

F. Perforation is a surgical emergency, yet it can be difficult to assess free air on a KUB alone. Perforation has been reported to occur in ~ 1/3 of NEC cases. Also, pneumatosis intestinalis may not be captured clearly on one abdominal radiograph view, yet seen quite clearly on another. Therefore, it is very important to obtain a left lateral decubitus view of the abdomen.

Necrotizing Enterocolitis 29

1.  Intestinal injury (usually ischemic)
2.  Abnormal microbial colonization of the gut
3.  Presence of substrate (feedings)

C. Since NEC can occur in the never-fed infant, and in previously healthy full-term infants without evidence of ischemic bowel insult, it is clear that multiple other factors and inhibitors may be present for the development of this disease.

D. Ischemia is considered to be a significant risk factor for NEC. Studies suggest that feeding leads to an enormous increase in intestinal oxygen consumption and that this increase is achieved primarily through a dramatic rise in oxygen extraction. Thus, in the presence of cardiovascular stress, the newborn intestine may be unable to achieve this increase.

E. Abnormal bacterial proliferation is considered a likely factor in the development of NEC, especially in light of the presence of epidemic forms of the disease.

F. Feeding, and its relationship to NEC, remain important areas of discussion. Since 90-95% of all infants who develop NEC have been fed, feeding is thought to play a role in NEC. However, the great majority of premature infants who are fed do not develop NEC. **The use of breast milk, and clear and consistent feeding algorithms are recommended as ways to reduce the incidence of NEC.** Lactoferrin, a normal component of human colostrum and milk, can enhance host defense and may be effective in the prevention of sepsis and NEC in preterm neonates. Implementation of a standardized feeding protocol utilizing human breast milk has been shown to be associated with a reduction of NEC and other morbidities in several studies and from several NICUs, including LPCH. Since growth and development is of extreme importance in the premature infant, initiation of feedings with breast milk should be considered at the earliest period feasible. A 2014. Cochrane analysis also found that in preterm and low birth weight infants, feeding with formula compared with donor breast milk resulted in a higher rate of short-term growth but also a higher risk of developing necrotizing enterocolitis. Based on best available evidence, recommendations for preferential use of breast milk when possible have also been made by the American Pediatric Surgery Association.

G. Probiotics are of increasing interest and potential use in NEC prevention bundles as a way to proactively colonize the intestine of preterm infants. Mechanisms by which probiotics may protect high risk infants from developing NEC include an increased barrier to migration bacteria across the mucosa, competitive exclusion of potential pathogens, modification of host response to microbial products, augmentation of immunoglobulin A (IgA) mucosal responses, enhancement of enteral nutrition that inhibits the growth of pathogens, and up- regulation of immune responses. Meta analyses and systematic reviews have shown that enteral supplementation of probiotics significantly decreases severe NEC and all cause mortality in preterm infants. However, issues remain: the incremental improvement in NEC and mortality with probiotic treatment in a breast milk-fed and very low NEC rate population has been questioned; strain-specific effects and methodological heterogeneity suggest there are limitations to the meta-analyses, and not all products are necessarily efficacious; probiotics appear generally safe, but there are risks for contamination and potential severe adverse effects in the highest risk ELBW population, thus information regarding probiotic preparation and quality control may require further evaluation.

V. **Treatment**

A. **Medical**: Early treatment and vigilant follow-up!

1. NPO with Replogle to low intermittent suction.
2. Comprehensive evaluation for sepsis including blood, urine, and CSF cultures, and CRPs.

292 Part II-F: Gastrointestinal

3. KUB and left lateral decubitus radiograph of the abdomen

4. Begin broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics (usually ampicillin, gentamicin, and metronidazole).

5. Correct laboratory derangements such as thrombocytopenia, anemia, hyponatremia, and acidosis. Follow-up laboratory evaluation should be performed, and may be necessary on a frequent basis.

6. If the infant has significant respiratory distress and is not currently intubated, intubation is indicated. NCPAP/CPAP is not generally recommended in cases of NEC due to potential for additive bowel injury secondary to further intestinal distention.

7. Frequent clinical exams focusing on change in abdominal color, abdominal girth, tenderness.

8. Follow KUB and left lateral decubitus views. Frequency is dependent on level of concern, serial findings on exams, and other factors.

9. <u>Consult Pediatric Surgery.</u> Should serial abdominal films reveal perforation, emergency intervention will be required. Deteriorating clinical condition, including persistent or progressive acidosis, even without frank pneumoperitoneum, may still be an indication for surgical intervention. Close communication with Pediatric Surgery is critical.

10. Assuming no surgical intervention is needed, enteral feeding is usually held for 7-14 days, depending on severity of presentation, and improvement in serial clinical exams.

B. Surgical:

1. Indications for surgical interventions are not absolute, differ from center to center, and among surgical experts. Indications may include perforation, increasing metabolic acidosis, possibly portending massive abdominal necrosis or an abdominal mass.
2. The "best" surgical approach (drain placement or open laparotomy, or primary anastomosis vs. enterostomy) for premature infants is not known. Observational studies and prospective trials have shown differing results with respect to short-term outcomes; long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes are rarely reported. The American Pediatric Surgical Association acknowledged a lack of comparative evidence to assess "best" approach, particularly with regard to longer term and neurodevelopmental outcomes, and further study is needed.
3. The NEC Steps trial, was a randomized controlled trial of laparotomy vs. drain for initial treatment of NEC with perforation or intestinal perforation, and examined only in-hospital or short-term outcomes. This study found that the type of intervention did not influence survival or other major short-term outcomes. But results of observational studies suggest that the type of initial intervention may be associated with adverse 18-22 month neurodevelopmental outcomes.
4. It is not yet clear whether laparotomy or drain is the better approach to surgical NEC and isolated intestinal perforation with respect to later neurodevelopmental outcomes. A multicenter, prospective randomized clinical trial of initial surgical intervention for infants BW < 1000 grams and <8 weeks of age (NICHD Neonatal Research Network ("Necrotizing Enterocolitis Surgery Trial", or NEST) has recently completed enrollment (March 2017). The primary outcome for this trial is death or neurodevelopmental impairment at 18-22 months. Secondary outcomes include time to full feeds, length of hospital stay, growth parameters at 36 weeks PMA, and other surgical endpoints.
