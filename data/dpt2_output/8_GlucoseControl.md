CONCLUSIONS

*   Glucose control in PN patients requires attention to a variety of details in order to keep the glucose values in a target range. Taking a planned approach will assist with achieving clinical success
*   The planned approach includes
    *   Identifying risk factors for hyper- or hypoglycemia
    *   Establish a target glucose range
    *   Properly dose insulin when needed
    *   Modify glucose monitoring when glucose is poorly controlled

**Jay M. Mirtallo, M.S., R.Ph, BCNSP, FASHP, FASPEN**
The Professor Emeritus
The Ohio State University, College of Pharmacy
Clinical Practice Specialist
American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition
Delaware, Ohio

<a id='05647eb0-6c03-456d-b340-9d2d205677ea'></a>

As one of the pharmacy specialist pioneers, Professor Mirtallo was
instrumental in leading cost-effective practices in parenteral nutrition and
advancing the role of the pharmacist on nutrition support services.

<a id='f33da980-5198-450a-86c6-978593238e55'></a>

Professor Mirtallo has been very active in professional societies and is Past President of the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN). He also spent many years on the ASPEN Public Policy Committee, where he advocated for reimbursement of enteral and parenteral nutrition in the hospital and home, dealt with drug shortage issues and worked to improve the safety and efficacy of parenteral nutrition.

<a id='b38fa052-6e6e-4ae2-97fc-e661cfa88dcc'></a>

As a representative to the Joint Commission, he served on the task force that created the Nutrition Care Standards. Mr. Mirtallo has been actively involved with nutrition support guidelines. Recently, he co-authored an etiology-based definition of malnutrition which is the basis for an inter-professional malnutrition strategy. He chaired a parenteral nutrition safety summit in the fall of 2011 which led to the development of the safety consensus recommendations released by ASPEN and the American Society for Health System Pharmacists. Currently Professor Mirtallo is Professor Emeritus at The Ohio State University, College of Pharmacy, Division of Pharmacy Practice and Administration. He is also a Clinical Practice Specialist with ASPEN.
