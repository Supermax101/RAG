One method of lowering potassium in liquids including human milk,
formulas (oral and enteral), and beverages such as cow's milk is the use
of medications to lower the potassium content with a binding agent.
Potassium, when bound to the heavy polymer, falls to the bottom of the
container, which creates a sludge that can be discarded. Exhibit 19-1
describes use of sodium polystyrene sulfonate. When potassium intake
has been exhausted, yet electrolyte derangements remain, clinicians
should consider nondietary contributors as listed in Exhibit 19-2. The
nutrition considerations of each renal replacement therapy can be found
in Exhibit 19-3.

<a id='8aa97c23-9bd5-4f78-a27d-faf02ae8e4ca'></a>

EXHIBIT 19-1. Pretreatment of Liquids to Reduce Potassium Content

* Add sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS) to volume of formula or expressed human milk, allow it to precipitate for a minimum of 30 minutes in a refrigerator, then decant the liquid from the residue that has settled at the bottom of the container.
* Suggested starting dose of SPS is 0.4–1.5 g/100 mL or 0.25–1 g/mmol K.
* Acting as an exchange resin, SPS could increase sodium, aluminum, iron, sulfur, pH while decreasing calcium, zinc, copper, phosphorus, manganese, and magnesium content of liquid.

EXHIBIT 19-3. Nutrition Considerations of Renal Replacement Therapy

1. Continuous renal replacement therapy:
   a. Higher protein provisions are recommended, and limitations in electrolytes are likely not needed because of continuous removal and losses.
   b. Consider nonrenal formulas for enteral formula choice to provide lower osmolality and nutrition for primary disease state (eg, sepsis, cardiovascular, oncology, burns, etc).
   c. May need additional supplementation of folate, thiamine, selenium, carnitine.a
2. Hemodialysis:
   a. Limited intake of potassium, phosphorus, sodium, and fluid via oral intake, enteral, and parenteral nutrition often required. Individualized restrictions based on age, size, and urine output.
3. Peritoneal dialysis:
   a. Daily dialysis may allow liberalized diet without potassium, sodium, or fluid restriction. Phosphorus restriction often remains.
   b. May need to consider absorption of dextrose from the dialysate if the child is gaining weight rapidly and/or considered overweight or obese.
4. Transplant:
   a. Successful kidney transplant should result in liberalization of electrolyte restrictions with increased fluid needs to maintain hydration.
   b. Hypophosphatemia is common posttransplant related to increased urinary phosphate excretion, decreased intestinal phosphate absorption, and hyperparathyroidism requiring a high phosphorus diet and/or supplementation.b
   c. Calcineurin inhibitor use (tacrolimus, cyclosporine) could result in hypomagnesemia and/or hyperkalemia. Magnesium supplementation, along with a high-magnesium diet, is often needed to maintain normal serum levels.

<a id='ae065643-59eb-4475-afbd-a4e414998015'></a>

Despite a functioning kidney, a low-potassium diet may be needed to maintain normal serum potassium levels. Avoid contraindicated fruits and their juices such as grapefruit because of disruption of drug metabolism.

d. Prevention of hyperlipidemia and cardiovascular disease is key to dietary goals posttransplant, including balanced macronutrient distribution with limited sodium, simple sugars, saturated fat, and trans fat. Rapid weight gain and obesity is common, which is thought to be related to improved appetite, reduction of malaise, liberalized diet, and/or use of corticosteroids. Nutrition counseling in weight management strategies is important after transplant.a

e. Follow food safety guidelines as established by the US Food and Drug Administration (https://www.fda.gov/food/people-risk-foodborne-illness/food-safety-older-adults-and-people-cancer-diabetes-hivaids-organ-transplants-and-autoimmune).a

# Implementation of Nutrition Plan and Monitoring

For an infant with CKD, breast feeding and/or breast milk is considered the preferred diet for under 1 year of age.5 However, because of potential for poor weight gain and growth, gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, slow gastric emptying), restricted or increased fluid needs, and modifications in nutrient intake, infants and children with CKD often need supplemental enteral feedings and adjustments in dietary intake to achieve goals for growth and nutrient levels. If oral intake is safely allowed, enteral feedings aim to supplement intake to promote oral skills and prevent oral aversion.6 Oral or enteral formula selection is individualized to achieve energy, protein, fluid, electrolyte, and micronutrient goals. Often combinations of breast milk, formulas, modulars, additives, and medications are required to meet the individual's needs and tolerance (see Tables 19-6 and 19-7). Because of the limited formula options for children with CKD, infant formulas may be used in those greater than 1 year of age, as well as adult formulas

<a id='455f6e2f-d940-4391-9c30-2d8fc7f1bc7f'></a>

being used in children greater than 1 year of age. The clinician must be
mindful of macro- and micronutrient intake if using these outside of the
indicated age groups.

# Introduction
The liver plays a role in the metabolism of all macronutrients. It stores glycogen, synthesizes major proteins, and makes bile, which is necessary for the absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins. In acute liver disease, malnutrition is unusual.¹ Children with chronic liver disease are at risk of malnutrition because of liver function chronically being affected. In the early stages of liver dysfunction, malnutrition is secondary to malabsorption with increased expenditure. In end-stage liver disease, malnutrition is caused by malabsorption, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and increased metabolic demands. The management of chronic liver disease must include nutrition strategies to prevent malnutrition and nutrient deficiencies for optimal growth and development. Pretransplant nutrition status has a direct effect on recovery after transplant.²

# Assessment and Nutrient Requirements

Regular assessment of nutrition status and nutrition requirements is critical for children with liver disease to promote growth and minimize complications of their disease.

<a id='92b14579-2400-4edb-899d-2f9a2e86d3a6'></a>

- History: Dietary recall
- Nutrition-focused physical examination
- Anthropometrics: Weight (affected by fluid overload and organomegaly in liver disease), length or height, head circumference, midarm upper circumference, triceps or subscapular skinfold thickness (less likely to be affected by fluid overload); upper arm measurements less affected than lower limb or truncal measurements³
- Laboratory test: Screening for fat-soluble vitamin (vitamins A, D, E, and K) deficiencies and for iron deficiency every 1–3 months³

<a id='706c46c2-2003-422e-bab0-51ba44d0e133'></a>

Liver disease affects macronutrient needs for multiple reasons, as outlined in Figure 20-1.

<a id='ed017ef8-359f-474a-a9c1-49130e4b9620'></a>

## Carbohydrates
Risk of hypoglycemia due to decreased gluconeogenesis and reduced glycogen stores

<a id='bff3e263-8693-4d63-a8da-dda7707f22b1'></a>

## Protein
* Increased use of protein for gluconeogenesis and reduced hepatocyte function to make proteins
* Increased breakdown leads to increased ammonia.
* Since children with chronic liver disease are growing, protein should not be restricted.
* Requirement is usually 3-4 g/kg/d.
* Branched-chain amino acids like leucine, isoleucine, and valine are preferred.
* If encephalopathic, may consider decreasing protein to 1-1.5 g/kg.

# Fat

* Cholestasis leads to malabsorption of fats due to decreased bile salts.
* Congested gastric mucosa and intestinal mucosa causes further worsening of fat malabsorption.
* Fat malabsorption can lead to deficiency of LCTs, fat-soluble vitamins, and essential fatty acids.
* Children with liver diseases need formula rich in MCTs, since MCTs do not require bile salts for absorption.
* To avoid essential fatty acid deficiency, supplemental essential fatty acids should be provided.
* LCTs should not be decreased to less than 10% of total energy intake to decrease the risk of essential fatty acid deficiency.

**Implementation of Nutrition Plan and Monitoring**

Children with liver disease require individualized nutrition plans and close monitoring. Energy intake should be 130%-150% of recommended daily allowance, which is about 130–150 kcal/kg/d in infants and 90–120 kcal/kg/d in children.1,4 Vitamin supplementation is outlined in Table 20-1.

normal levels.

<a id='309c4ebf-5a67-4dd5-9866-a2ae37ec6bc8'></a>

**Type and Mode of Feeds**
**Enteral Nutrition**

Oral feeds are preferred when possible. Human milk is generally preferred, supplemented with medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil. If using fortification, human milk can be fortified with formula containing a higher proportion of MCTs.² Most MCT-containing formulas have lower palatability because of hydrolyzed products, but generally infants tolerate the formulas better with time.²

<a id='af756af3-97b6-4a94-ba6f-f3b95f6d3154'></a>

If nutrition needs are not met orally, supplementation via a nasogastric (NG) tube is required. Starting continuous feeds at night improves intake during the day intake and maximizes oral nutrition. Gastrostomy tubes should be avoided in children with chronic liver disease because of portal hypertension and the possibility of peristomal varices. They can be considered in patients with more stable disease. NG tubes may exacerbate variceal bleed and should be placed with caution.

<a id='ee075739-d6db-4745-8a1f-82e5f271daee'></a>

# Parenteral Nutrition
Children who cannot tolerate or fail to grow on EN may need parenteral nutrition (PN). The energy goal of PN should be based on estimated energy requirement for age because there is no risk of malabsorption. The fluid goal is typically 75%–90% of maintenance fluids because of the risk of ascites, and daily sodium is limited to 2–3 mEq/kg because aggressive correction in end-stage liver disease can aggravate ascites.²

<a id='6ccd0cd1-8a6f-4437-b41f-8a79ebc8cd4d'></a>

In end-stage liver disease, PN may be needed to run over 24 hours because of the risk of hypoglycemia.²

<a id='1579044c-5b6e-4c71-8f11-1d0f58eb5c37'></a>

**Acute Liver Disease**
Acute liver disease is a rapidly progressive disease that requires a multidisciplinary team including a hepatologist for management.

<a id='fb881957-4b16-4160-8e9e-ef03eb90bcf0'></a>

Management of acute liver failure requires fluid resuscitation and electrolyte replacements as outlined in Table 20-2.

**_Posttransplant Considerations of Nutrition_**

**Early Postoperative Period**

Early enteral feeds within 24–36 hours are preferred once postoperative
ileus has resolved. NG tube feedings can be used.
Once oral feeds are started, enteral feeds can be used at night to
maintain daytime appetite. The oral diet should be high protein and high

<a id='73d06e04-a923-47b1-8a88-11175853a5c6'></a>

energy to compensate for the weight loss before transplant and promote early healing. In the case of chylous ascites, a low-fat diet or low-long-chain triglyceride formula can be used.2

<a id='7601f3f0-6d2d-467d-86f0-2e2631d82edf'></a>

PN should be used if surgical complications delay the initiation of enteral feeds. Electrolyte abnormalities are common after transplant and should be monitored. It is important to monitor for drug–nutrient interactions and counsel patients about possible interactions.

<a id='0f5356b9-f12d-49ac-80be-6ac279939db1'></a>

# Long-Term Posttransplant Nutrition
A standard age-appropriate diet is appropriate for most children. The goal of energy intake is 100%-120% of the estimated energy requirement for catch-up growth.² Once pretransplant weight gain is achieved and muscle mass is gained, careful weaning should be done to avoid excessive weight gain. Long-term increased energy and fat intake and the need for steroids can increase the risk of obesity.

<a id='5e40a259-9dc4-4cf1-88c4-a1a2a5d427a2'></a>

The diet and anthropometrics of patients with a liver transplant should be monitored at each visit to prevent obesity, and patient and families should be educated about the risk of obesity. A diet low in saturated fat and high in fruits and vegetables should be encouraged.

<a id='416e842a-f762-40a6-973f-bd0e82ef21d0'></a>

Patients are at risk of bone disease because of fat-soluble vitamin maldigestion pretransplant, deconditioning and loop diuretics, and frequent steroid use.

* Vitamin D should be monitored at least every 3-6 months for the first 2 years after transplant.
* Following dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans annually can be considered.
* Calcium, magnesium, and phosphorous should be monitored regularly.
* Calcium supplementation should be considered in those with decreased bone density and vitamin D deficiency.3

# Introduction

Childhood cancer is the leading cause of death from a disease in children in the United States, affecting an estimated 1 in 285 children less than 20 years old with 15,780 new cases yearly.¹ The survival rate of childhood cancer is 80%, but it can be much lower for rare cancers.²

Types of childhood cancers include the following:

*   Leukemia: Cancer of the blood; it is the most common type of childhood cancer. Types include
    *   Acute lymphoblastic leukemia and
    *   Acute myeloid leukemia.²
*   Lymphoma: Cancer of the immune system; types include
    *   Hodgkin and
    *   Non-Hodgkin lymphoma.²
*   Solid tumors: Cancer of the bones, organs, or tissues. The most common solid tumors in children include
    *   Brain and spinal cord tumors
    *   Ewing sarcoma
    *   Germ cell tumors
    *   Hepatoblastoma
    *   Kidney/Wilms tumors
    *   Neuroblastoma
    *   Osteosarcoma
    *   Retinoblastoma

Treatment options include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).$^{3,4}$
HSCT is typically used for refractory or high-risk cancers and various nonmalignant conditions. HSCT is the transplant of bone marrow, peripheral blood stem cells, or umbilical cord blood to replace diseased and defective bone marrow and restore hematopoietic and immunologic function, typically after high-dose chemotherapy and/or radiation.
Patients can receive their own stem cells (autologous) or cells from another person such as a sibling, parent (haploidentical), or unrelated donor (allogeneic).$^{4,5}$

## Assessment and Nutrient Requirements

Standard criteria that put patients at high nutrition risk apply to patients with cancer. Patients who do not meet these criteria but are receiving high-dose chemotherapy or combination therapy for aggressive cancers or are undergoing HSCT may be considered at high nutrition risk.

<a id='3c259424-eaf2-4091-9fb9-b1f84b765ce9'></a>

A standard nutrition assessment should be conducted at diagnosis,
throughout treatment, and into survivorship with consideration for type
and stage of cancer, treatment protocol, and effects of therapy. 6,7
Anthropometric data should be compared with prediagnosis data and
monitored longitudinally.6 A nutrition-focused physical examination can
help identify the presence of lean muscle loss, increased fat mass,
influence of tumor mass, and hydration status. Routine mid-upper arm
circumference and triceps skinfold measurements may be a better
indicator of nutrition status than weight because they are less affected by
fluid shifts and tumor mass. Careful assessment of hair, eyes, mouth,
skin, and nails should be conducted to identify signs of micronutrient
deficiencies.7

***Malnutrition in Oncology and HSCT Patients***

<a id='8ac2dbd5-8163-4fd8-b531-1488decd8db5'></a>

Between 6% and 50% of children will present with acute malnutrition at diagnosis, whereas 8%–32% of children will develop malnutrition during treatment. 4,8,9 The degree and pattern of malnutrition will depend on the diagnosis, stage of disease, intensity of the treatment regimen, socioeconomic status, nutrition status at diagnosis, and other comorbidities. 10,11 Malnutrition during treatment can lead to decreased immune function, increased risk of infection, delayed wound healing, and altered drug metabolism. See Table 21-1 for the contributors to malnutrition in pediatric cancer.

The goal of nutrition therapy is to maintain body stores and minimize
muscle wasting to promote normal growth and development while the
patient is receiving therapy. 6,7
Patients can be at risk for refeeding at time of diagnosis and various
periods throughout treatment. Nutrition recommendations for refeeding
should be followed (see discussion on refeeding in chapter 6, "Parenteral
Nutrition").

_**Energy, Protein, and Fluid Needs**_

The energy needs of pediatric oncology and HSCT patients will vary depending on their current nutrition status, phase of the disease, and treatment plan. 10 Indirect calorimetry (IC) is the gold standard to determine resting energy expenditure (REE) in this population. In the absence of IC, energy needs can by estimated by using a predictive equation such as the Schofield equation for the basal metabolic rate (BMR), the World Health Organization equation for the REE, or the estimated energy requirement equation with stress factors for growth, infections, and stress. 7,13 See Tables 21-2 and 21-3 for calorie and protein requirements.

**_Oral Nutrition_**

Optimization of oral nutrition may be offered as an initial strategy, including an emphasis on small, frequent meals of nutrient-dense foods and beverages, as well as oral supplements.6 Appetite stimulants may be used, although their efficacy has not been consistently demonstrated.4,6 Common appetite simulants include megestrol, dronabinol, and cyproheptadine. Young children and toddlers are at risk for developing

<a id='4a97a2b1-a853-45de-b339-634ec2336662'></a>

oral/food aversions because of nausea, vomiting, and taste changes during treatment. Referral to feeding therapy should be considered. 10

<a id='f0fce54d-38cd-480d-a459-43f98265c13d'></a>

Patients who are immunocompromised (absolute neutrophil count <500 cells/µL) should receive counseling on proper food safety guidelines as recommended by the US Food and Drug Administration (Exhibit 21-1).¹⁴ Recent studies have shown that following a neutropenic or low-microbial diet does not decrease risk of infection more than that of standard food safety practices.¹⁵,¹⁶

# Enteral Nutrition
Enteral nutrition (EN) via feeding tube should be considered when oral intake/supplementation is unsuccessful in maintaining adequate nutrition. For children undergoing highly intensive therapy, including HSCT, proactive EN tube placement should be considered. There can be

<a id='6746cba8-f315-479a-a19c-bb7b572d68d6'></a>

hesitation and reluctance in providing EN within the pediatric oncology
and HSCT community. EN can often be perceived as a punishment for
not eating; therefore, it is important to present EN as a positive, not
punitive, intervention. Studies have shown that EN in HSCT patients is
feasible, reduces costs, and may have a protective benefit over PN in the
development of acute gastrointestinal (GI) graft vs host disease

<a id='65bd6ab6-0b2f-4710-99bd-5a9cceec6f67'></a>

(GVHD).¹⁷
Continuous feeds are generally better tolerated than intermittent bolus feedings and are the preferred schedule for patients at high risk for nausea and vomiting, constipation, or diarrhea. In patients with intractable vomiting, placement of a postpyloric feeding tube can minimize the risk of repeated reinsertions of the tube.⁶

Formula considerations include the following:
* For most oncology and HSCT patients, a low-osmolarity standard formula with or without fiber may be used to initiate tube feeds.⁶
* Extensively hydrolyzed or elemental formulas can be appropriate for patients with significant GI tract inflammation or malabsorption.⁶
* With postpyloric feeding, consider formulas with fiber or low osmolarity because they may minimize the duration and severity of diarrhea.⁶

**Parenteral Nutrition**

Parenteral nutrition (PN) should be considered when all attempts for sufficient oral and enteral feedings have failed or EN is contraindicated.6 Indications for PN include neutropenic enterocolitis, ileus, bowel obstruction/perforation, severe GI GVHD after HSCT, radiation enteritis, severe mucositis, intractable vomiting, and protracted diarrhea.4,6,7 Pediatric oncology patients receiving PN are at high risk for hepatoxicity due to hepatotoxic chemotherapy agents and infections.6

<a id='63fb6752-6493-4cb4-bb9d-5b621e725798'></a>

***Vitamins and Minerals***

Oncology and HSCT patients are at risk of osteopenia and osteoporosis because of prolonged hospitalizations with decreased physical activity, decreased sun exposure, and treatments including methotrexate, corticosteroids, and radiation.10 Monitor and supplement serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels at diagnosis and throughout treatment. Calcium supplementation should be considered for patients not meeting dietary reference intake (DRI) for age through oral or EN intake.10

<a id='0acc606b-f647-4762-a310-e56b5e549296'></a>

The routine use of micronutrient supplements can be controversial,
but in the depleted patient, supplementation within DRI for age is
generally regarded as safe.<sup>6</sup> Avoid iron supplements because of the risk
for iron overload from frequent blood transfusions.<sup>7</sup>

<a id='2b1b69b8-eec2-4994-ab76-aa2205e5f69f'></a>

*Laboratory Values*
Clinical judgement should be used when assessing laboratory values because cancer therapy drugs, inflammation, infections, and fluid status may alter these results.<sup>6</sup>

<a id='88e44dda-e9f4-4af8-8ed2-ba9a1e34f05e'></a>

_**Additional Treatment-Related Adverse Effects**_

The following are additional treatment-related adverse effects:

*   Pancreatitis: Nutrition recommendations for pancreatitis should be followed (see discussion on nutrition management of pancreatitis in chapter 22, "Pancreatitis").
*   Tumor lysis syndrome: In cases of elevated potassium and phosphorus levels, some patients may need to limit potassium and phosphorus intake in their diet and use phosphorus binders. 18
*   Neutropenic enterocolitis (typhlitis): Bowel rest may be indicated, and PN may be required. 6
*   Steroids: Acute adverse effects of steroid use include hyperglycemia and increased appetite. A no-concentrated-sweets diet and the use of insulin may be indicated to help manage elevated blood glucose levels. Longer-term effects of steroid use include insulin resistance, decreased bone mineralization, and increases in fat mass. >4,12
*   GVHD: This is a condition in which donor-derived T cells attack host cells after HSCT. In cases of severe GI GVHD, patients may need bowel rest with PN followed by a low-fiber, low-lactose, low-fat, bland diet. 10

<a id='7216d52b-952e-45b4-98e5-ebaad6ba0330'></a>

- Hepatic sinusoidal obstructive syndrome, also called hepatic veno-occlusive disease:
  This syndrome typically occurs within the first 10–20 days after HSCT. Chemotherapy
  toxicity leads to the narrowing and occlusion of hepatic venules, sinusoidal fibrosis, and
  hepatocyte necrosis, which results in hyperbilirubinemia, jaundice, weight gain, ascites,
  and painful hepatomegaly. Sodium and fluid restrictions are often indicated.19 EN or
  oral diet is preferred over PN to reduce stress on the liver.20 If PN is indicated, measures
  to reduce stress on the liver should be taken such as preventing overfeeding, preventing
  high dextrose load, monitoring triglyceride levels, and discontinuing or reducing added
  copper and manganese.21

**Monitoring and Late Effects**

Survivors of childhood cancer are at risk for multiple long-term morbidities, including obesity, metabolic syndrome, heart disease, and osteopenia/osteoporosis.⁶ Promotion of a healthy lifestyle and ongoing nutrition assessment and counseling is beneficial.

# Assessment and Nutrient Requirements

Nutrition screening is required at admission for every child with acute pancreatitis. An initial screening and periodic rescreening are recommended in chronic pancreatitis because of the risk of vitamin and fat malabsorption. Children with acute recurrent pancreatitis or chronic pancreatitis should undergo nutrition screening at every outpatient follow-up visit, typically every 3–6 months.

* History: Dietary recall, assessment of malabsorption (stool frequency and consistency), and adherence to pancreatic enzymatic supplements.
* Physical exam: Anthropometric data (weight for age, weight for length, body mass index, mid-upper arm circumference, and triceps skinfold thickness).
* Laboratory assessment: Screening for pancreatic insufficiency with fecal elastase should be performed at least annually. Vitamin A, D, E, and K screening should be conducted annually, and a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scan should be done in case of malnutrition, persistently low vitamin D, or a history of fractures.

Implementation of Nutrition Plan and Monitoring

<a id='85e9a034-9a3a-43b6-a243-5068f0e79230'></a>

The type of pancreatitis a child has influences their nutrition plan and monitoring.

<a id='0d6a1cf2-3702-4d4a-af1d-52d7cb2d1153'></a>

**Acute Pancreatitis**

For acute pancreatitis, early introduction of oral or enteral nutrition (EN)
is recommended.¹ An oral solid diet with no fat restrictions can be
introduced early; this has been associated with a shorter length of stay
and fewer intensive care unit admissions. The oral route is preferred to
EN, but EN can be used when oral intake is poor. Parenteral nutrition
(PN) should be used only when oral, nasogastric, or nasojejunal feeds are
not tolerated. If PN is needed, it should be combined with EN as
tolerated.

<a id='d865a14a-9da8-422e-a99d-77137159e2ef'></a>

_**Acute Recurrent Pancreatitis**_

In between episodes of acute pancreatitis, children should be given a regular-fat diet, except for patients with hypertriglyceridemia. A low-fiber diet is preferred with pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy because fiber can absorb pancreatic enzymes and/or decrease their action. In case of failure to meet nutrition goals with an oral diet, oral high-energy beverages can be used. EN is used when necessary.

<a id='f3b2e2aa-2437-4b11-9445-2e48eeda258f'></a>

Pancreatic enzyme supplementation should not be routinely used in children with acute recurrent pancreatitis. These children should not have exocrine pancreatic insufficiency; if they do, they should receive a diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis and will need pancreatic enzyme supplementation.

<a id='3977d807-613d-4885-a43c-63a0e868e7ee'></a>

**Chronic Pancreatitis**
Children with chronic pancreatitis should be given a regular diet. In case of diabetes, children with chronic pancreatitis require a low-carbohydrate diet.2 Pancreatic enzyme supplementation is similar to supplementation for patients with CF (see chapter 12, "Cystic Fibrosis").

# Introduction

Ketogenic diet therapies (KDTs) are therapeutic interventions for the treatment of refractory epilepsy that have been in use since the 1920s. The diets are designed to mimic the biochemical response to starvation, in which ketone bodies rather than glucose become the main fuel for the brain's energy demands. Although the exact mechanism of action has never been fully elucidated, KDT has become an integral part of the management of refractory epilepsy. 1,2

<a id='b890cc0c-582c-4273-afcf-2fa7363c0c5a'></a>

The use of KDT involves multiple health care team members who work collaboratively to ensure a successful transition to KDT, monitoring, and maintenance. Team members include the parents/caregivers, dietitian, neurologist, pharmacist, and other subspecialists to manage and monitor the cooccurring conditions and adverse effects that may occur. This chapter will focus on KDT management by the dietitian and demonstrate their role as an integral member of the multidisciplinary team.

### *Types of Ketogenic Diets*

<a id='4451f953-a2e9-4193-b74d-7d94480284e0'></a>

Ketogenic diets fall on a spectrum, with classic diets being the most restrictive and low glycemic index treatment diets being the least restrictive (Table 23-1). Ketogenic diet options frequently use ratios of grams of fat to nonfat (protein and net carbohydrates), whereas other variations use carbohydrate counting.

When selecting a ketogenic diet option for a patient, consider the following:
* Diagnosis (see Tables 23-2 and 23-3)
* Age (certain KDTs can provide greater benefit for specific age ranges)
* Feeding method (enteral, parenteral, by mouth, or a combination of feeding methods)
* Family desire for structure vs flexibility

# Suggested Treatment Recommendations for Most Common Adverse Effects

The following are potential adverse effects that the health care team will need to address and advise an appropriate treatment plan based on the patient's individual needs.

1.  Acidosis
    *   Signs and symptoms include dehydration, fatigue, and vomiting.
    *   Consider prescribing a bicarbonate and/or citrate buffer at initiation of classic ketogenic ratios.
        *   1–2 mEq/kg divided into 2–3 doses daily.

<a id='2e2ce4a5-6ba1-4341-85ff-21e04796bd1d'></a>

* Discuss with the health care team whether topiramate or zonisamide can be reduced or avoided as KDT in combination with these medications may put the child at higher risk of acidosis.
2. Constipation
    * Ensure adequate hydration.
    * Incorporate medium-chain triglyceride oil, avocados, or high insoluble fiber vegetables into the diet.
    * The child may require additional medications, such as milk of magnesia, suppository, enema, or polyethylene glycol 3350.
3. Gastroesophageal Reflux (GER)
    * Recommend smaller, more frequent meals.
    * Children with GER will likely require an acid blocker reflux medication.

Assessment and Nutrient Requirements

<a id='7977dcbc-033d-4548-8a08-a711b2811181'></a>

**_Pediatric Growth Assessment_**

Use the following guidelines for pediatric growth assessment:

* World Health Organization growth charts: 0–24 months of age
* Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts: 2–20 years of age
* Use of body mass index (BMI) may not be useful for this population because many children have neurological disabilities; therefore, BMI may not be accurate. Consider using mid–upper arm circumference measurements instead.

<a id='7f87a977-1849-4baa-9010-32956ca814bb'></a>

**Estimating Nutrient Needs**
Table 23-5 provides guidance on estimating nutrient needs, and Table 23-
6 provides macronutrient composition of each diet in percent of total
calories.

### Vitamin and Electrolyte Supplementation

<a id='53a74ef8-a28d-4e8d-aaaf-6e2697dee14a'></a>

Vitamin and mineral supplementation is required for all types of medical ketogenic diets because of the high fat and low carbohydrate volume in the diet (see chapter 2, “Malnutrition,” for specific requirements). The following nutrients are most commonly deficient in ketogenic diets:
* Vitamin B₁
* Vitamin D
* Magnesium
* Phosphorus
* Copper
* Zinc
* Selenium
* Carnitine³

<a id='6627b610-8bff-429f-8b31-15fbc8e12975'></a>

Vitamin and mineral supplementation plans should be specific to the patient and their individual needs, but most children will need a multivitamin and vitamin D/calcium supplement while on a ketogenic diet. Salt or potassium supplementation may be needed based on calculated intake and laboratory results.

<a id='ad154207-8a5f-46c8-8d47-049f640528b3'></a>

**Medication and Carbohydrate Content**

Many medications contain carbohydrates that may need to be calculated into a child's ketogenic diet plan. It is recommended that all medications be changed to the lowest carbohydrate form, which is often a pill or tablet formulation. It is important to include a clinical pharmacist on the team and aim for the carbohydrate content of medications to be less than 1000 mg of carbohydrates, if possible. To reduce exposure to higher carbohydrate content medications such as liquid suspensions, having a clinical decision support tool like an alert or flag can be useful in reducing prescribing errors.4

<a id='e97ac2d0-781f-4fa0-8fb6-dc28512a10a9'></a>

# Implementation and Nutrition Plan and Monitoring

Most ketogenic diets can be initiated at home or in the hospital. However, medical supervision is required for all diet starts. Baseline laboratory results should be obtained prior to initiation (see Table 23-7 for

<a id='70a2dd2c-55dd-4dfc-ac8a-69968ab6374e'></a>

recommendations) and should then be obtained regularly during initiation.

Abbreviation: KDT, ketogenic diet therapy.

<a id='9602a772-6de8-4aa1-92fa-11cc262ff0a0'></a>

Note the following:

* Ketogenic diet formulas are more concentrated (~1.5 kcal/mL) than standard pediatric products (~1 kcal/mL); therefore, dilution of the ketogenic formula may be necessary.

<a id='1eb87495-3847-4eee-a938-d322957c36e3'></a>

* In the intensive care unit, ketogenic diets are often initiated at the goal ratio, whereas calories are slowly titrated up.
* Outpatient (home) diet initiations are typically a slower induction process, making 1 change every week or more.

<a id='87f0bf53-5baa-4a4f-b524-e37f6f15f5dd'></a>

*Laboratory Monitoring Protocol*

Laboratory monitoring is important throughout the course of KDT to monitor for any abnormalities and trends (see Table 23-9). The laboratory monitoring protocols can be adjusted for each institution.

### Ketone Measurements
Ketones are generally checked frequently during the initial period of the KDT (sometimes twice daily or every void) and are eventually spaced out once in the maintenance phase of the diet (see Table 23-10).

<a id='49f97592-f1cd-4132-99c9-822d028cb5b2'></a>

**Sick Day Management**

When a child on a ketogenic diet is ill and unable to consume the
prescribed diet plan, it is very important to maintain adequate hydration
with sugar-free fluids, broths, or sugar-free gelatin. Monitor for signs and
symptoms of hypoglycemia (defined as a blood glucose <50 mg/dL) or
excessive ketosis and provide small amounts of carbohydrate correction
if needed, ensuring that all medications are in the lowest carbohydrate
form.

<a id='b3d3937d-176e-43c7-a046-ed2ba3af8570'></a>

If the patient can tolerate clear liquids, advance to a half-strength formula or half of a ketogenic diet meal without the added fat. Once the patient is tolerating this step, advance to a three-fourths strength formula mixture if enterally fed or add half the volume of fat back into the diet if orally fed. Once the patient is tolerating this step, advance back to the full ketogenic diet ratio.

<a id='8c636245-cf87-41c8-a801-09ddbffb154b'></a>

***Special Circumstances***

<a id='81b09683-341f-474a-a97e-5cefc3c811eb'></a>

# Infants⁵

Initiation of KDT in all infants should occur in the hospital setting. The goal ratio is at least 3:1, with advancement to goal using a stepped approach. Monitor and adjust nutrient needs (calories, protein, fluid) accordingly based on growth, and evaluate the diet closely to meet micronutrient needs. Monitor the following:
* Blood glucose (minimum of twice daily) to watch for hypoglycemia
* Blood ketones twice daily (blood ketones are more accurate than urine ketones in infants)

<a id='56d597b9-4425-4b3d-8fe8-982814216809'></a>

Blood ketone and blood glucose monitoring can be decreased based on trends and provider discretion.

<a id='7eb1cd82-10b7-41e3-9009-d7b8a96aa52a'></a>

**Intensive Care Unit**⁶

Ketogenic diets may be emergently started in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting for patients with the following diagnoses (among others, as determined by the medical team):
* New-onset refractory status epilepticus
* Febrile infection–related epilepsy syndrome
* Super-refractory status epilepticus

<a id='af30c1ef-2a20-4469-955c-daae5faf5f04'></a>

Generally, classic diets are initiated at goal ratio (4:1) with 50% of calories that are titrated to goal. Higher ratios (such as 5:1) may be used temporarily. Indirect calorimetry is helpful for determining caloric goals. Continuous enteral feeds or parenteral nutrition may be needed, depending on clinical status. The dietary reference intake for protein should be provided at a minimum. Monitoring of urine ketones is not recommended in the ICU; check blood ketones if possible.

<a id='e19938d2-fb37-40ee-8774-fbb612d2bab1'></a>

**Total Parenteral Nutrition**7
Ketogenic total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is indicated when enteral
feedings are not tolerated. The indication for starting ketogenic TPN is
based on clinical condition. Electrolytes in the TPN solution should be

<a id='148a67b4-284e-4f7a-af1e-7bc9d5bb3c3a'></a>

adjusted based on clinical need. Dextrose limits are individualized per institution. Attempt to provide the least amount of dextrose possible. Some institutions may be able to compound with no dextrose included.

*   Lipid infusion should start at 0.5–1 mL/kg/h and be advanced by 0.5–1 mL/kg/h daily until achieving the highest possible lipid infusion rate.
    *   Count the carbohydrate content of glycerol from the lipids when calculating the ketogenic ratio.
*   Protein intake should be adequate for need based on the clinical condition.

Monitor laboratory measurements daily, specifically triglycerides (TGs), electrolytes, and bicarbonate. When interpreting TG results, consider whether the lipid infusion was running at the time of the blood draw. Adding carnitine supplementation to TPN is recommended.

_Discontinuing the Ketogenic Diet_

Significant variation of when and how quickly to discontinue diet therapy is based on the child's individual needs.⁸ Many institutions adhere to the recommendation of attempting the diet for a minimum of 3 months to allow time for fine-tuning and time for the diet to demonstrate effectiveness. If the diet is successful in reducing the child's seizure burden, most centers will start the weaning discussion after the child has been on the diet for 2 years. A plan for recurrence of seizures or worsening of seizures during the diet wean should be discussed with the child's ketogenic diet team. Some families may be hesitant to wean their child's KDT based on how beneficial it has been.

There has been a concern that weaning KDTs too quickly would cause a dramatic increase in seizures, but this is not supported by current literature. It is typically safe to make diet changes every 1–2 weeks, but children may require a faster or slower wean depending on the circumstances. Table 23-11 provides a sample KDT weaning plan.
