# Introduction

*   PN can be life-saving but has several complications
    *   Metabolic
    *   Catheter-related
        *   Infectious
        *   Non-infectious
    *   Liver disease
*   Progress has been made to ensure PN is safer and more effective
*   Patients on PN require careful monitoring
    *   Growth and anthropometric measurements
    *   Laboratory
*   The practitioner must be aware of the risks of PN and be able to monitor the patients adequately

## Case #2

* During a regular follow up, the parents of a 12-year-old patient on home PN mentions that she has had 3 episodes of fever in the past 2 weeks
* There are no other symptoms, fever resolves spontaneously within 1 hour and they elected not to seek medical care
* When questioned, they mention that the episodes of fever seem to occur shortly after they connect her PN. She is currently well with no fever
* What is your next step?

Metabolic Complications: Nutrient Excess/Deficiency

* Caloric needs should be evaluated according to age-related requirements and adjusted to the patient's specific requirements
  * Catch-up growth
  * Conditions that may increase needs (surgery, chronic disease, burn, trauma etc.)
  * Conditions with increased losses
  * PN needs are generally 10-15% lower than EN needs
* Overfeeding has been linked to PN associated liver disease
* Underfeeding leads to growth failure

* Glucose
  * Excess glucose may cause hyperglycemia, hyperosmolarity and osmotic diuresis
  * Hypercarbia may also occur as well as increased risk of sepsis
  * Inadequate glucose infusion (<2 mg/kg/min) may cause ketosis, since fat is mobilized for energy

* Lipids
  * Excess lipids may cause hypertriglyceridemia and ketosis
  * Inadequate lipid provision may lead to essential fatty acid deficiency
* Lipid infusion rate goal: <0.15 g/kg/hour

<a id='8c691ab0-a50f-4422-aa91-b5a5dc57aceb'></a>

- Calculating GIR
  - Grams of carbohydrate x 1000 ÷ patient weight (kg) ÷ number of minutes PN infuses (example: 1440 minutes for 24-hour infusion)

* Electrolytes
  * PN should not be used to correct metabolic disturbances
* Fluid output and intake should be monitored to avoid fluid overload and dehydration especially when patients have significant losses (emesis, diarrhea, burn)
* Urinary sodium should be monitored in patients with excessive losses since inadequate sodium intake affects growth
  * Serum sodium should be between 135 and 145 mmol/L
  * Urinary sodium should be > 30 mmol/L

# Metabolic Complications: Nutrient Excess/Deficiency
*   Trace elements
    *   Zinc often needs to be supplemented in patients with excessive GI losses
    *   Selenium deficiency may occur in patients on long-term PN
    *   Chromium is a contaminant and may accumulate affecting glucose metabolism
    *   Copper is excreted in bile and can accumulate in patients with cholestasis
    *   Parenteral manganese has high bioavailability and is cleared through the liver, increasing the risk for overload in patients with hepatic dysfunction. Manganese accumulation in the central nervous system may cause neurological problems

*   Manifestations include
    *   Hypophosphoremia
    *   Hypokalemia
    *   Hypomagnesemia
    *   Hyperglycemia
    *   Thiamine deficiency
    *   Fluid overload leading to congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema

# Management of Refeeding Syndrome

*   Identification of patients at risk
    *   Low BMI
    *   Significant weight loss
    *   Little or no nutritional intake in the past 5-10 days
*   Preexisting hypokalemia, hypophosphoremia and hypomagnesemia

<a id='1105e94e-c5bc-4068-8fc4-2a910c39fc39'></a>

* Monitor electrolytes several times a day after initiation of PN until stable
* Stabilize electrolytes before initiating PN
    * Start with providing 50-75% estimated energy needs or give current intake
    * Increase calories by 10-20% daily until goal reached
    * Supplement thiamine
    * Supplement phosphorus as needed

# Metabolic Complications: Bone Disease

*   The term Metabolic Done Disease (MBD) includes several conditions including rickets, osteomalacia, osteoporosis
*   Reduction of bone mineral density may be evident before clinical signs appear
    *   Diagnosis relies on dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA)
*   Multifactorial pathogenesis
    *   Malabsorption of Ca, Phos, Mg
    *   Decreased physical activity
    *   Vit D deficiency
    *   Toxicity of some PN components such as aluminum
    *   Underlying inflammatory condition

# Central Venous Access

*   The maximum osmolarity that can be administered in a peripheral vein in 900 mOsm/L
*   The osmolarity of an intravenous solution can be calculated using the equation:
    mOsm/L = (AA g/L × 10) + (dextrose g/L × 5) + ([mEq Na + mEq K] × 2)/L + (mEq Ca × 1.4)/L
*   PN is usually administered through a central venous catheter whose tip is in the distal vena cava to allow administration of a solution with a higher osmolarity and provide adequate caloric intake
    *   Peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC line)
    *   Tunneled cuffed central catheter (Broviac/Hickman)
    *   Implanted port (Port-o-cath)

* Most thromboses are asymptomatic
* Prevention

    * Annual doppler ultrasound of vascular access may not detect thrombosis, consider CT or MRV
* In patients on long-term PN who have lost vascular access because of a thrombus, consider prophylactic anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin

Central Line Complications: Thrombosis

* Diagnosis
  * Ultrasound is non-invasive and easy to perform but may not be adequate for diagnosis of subclavian and superior vena cava thrombosis
  * If the ultrasound is negative and clinical suspicion is high, venography may be required for accurate diagnosis
* Management
  * Thrombotic central line occlusion and central line related thrombosis require thorough investigation and treatment
  * Fibrinolytics such as alteplase is the drug class of choice to restore line patency of thrombus-occluded catheters
  * The recommended management of acute and symptomatic catheter-related thrombosis usually requires antithrombotic medication

# Central Line Complications: Infections / CLABSIs

* Central Line Associated Bloodstream Infections (CLABSIs) are a significant cause of mortality and morbidity in patients on PN
* Incidence of CLABSI in pediatric patients is between 3.8-11.3/1000 catheter days

<a id='09f6839f-bbc6-49ed-a11e-a9e1f2f96da4'></a>

- Causes
  - Colonization of biofilm
  - Skin contamination
  - Bacterial translocation
  - Contaminated PN solution

Central Line Complications: Infections / CLABSIs Prevention

<a id='1fa1deb2-7ade-4a7a-8033-c277f879ea34'></a>

* Sterile technique during placement
* Use line only for PN and not for blood draws
* Dressing changes per protocol
* Tubing changes for dextrose AA solutions and IV lipid
* Avoid multi-lumen catheters
* Avoid catheters in groin/diaper area

- Lock Therapy

<a id='f07f4960-f1f1-4ec6-94a8-98344a496186'></a>

- Ethanol lock
  - Significantly reduces CLABSI
  - Concerns with precipitate formation in catheters and shortages
- Taurolidine lock
  - Used mostly in Europe with good results
- Antibiotic lock
  - May induces resistances to antibiotics
- 4% EDTA lock (Kite lock)
  - Approved in Canada
  - Non-antibiotic, anti-bacterial, anti-coagulant, anti-biofilm
  - Significantly reduces the rate of CLABSI

Central Line Complications: Infections / CLABSIs Management

<a id='17b01586-e1eb-4bf6-ac00-86cb554a7ad0'></a>

* Any fever (>38.5) in a patient with a central line is considered a CLABSI until proven otherwise
* Blood cultures should be taken from both the CVC and a peripheral vein before starting antibiotic
* Empirical antibiotic therapy should include coverage for cutaneous as well as intestinal bacteria
* The duration of antimicrobial therapy for CLABSI with retained catheter is generally 10-14-days
* Central line should be removed if there is clinical deterioration, persisting or relapsing bacteremia, or complications and with some infectious agents (s aureus, pseudomonas or candida)

Interventions

*   Vit A
    *   Vit A toxicity leads to complications including liver damage
    *   Plan: Decrease parenteral MVI to 3 days/week and recheck level in 3 months.
*   Vit D
    *   Begin 75 IU/kg vitamin D enterally or as dissolvable quick melt.
*   Vit E
    *   Elevated levels are common with patients on SMOF.
    *   Decreasing MVI to 3 days/week will address elevated vit E.
*   Calcium
    *   Correct calcium for low albumin.
    *   Equation = 0.8 (4 (nl albumin) – 2.5 (pt's albumin)) = 1.2 + 8.5 (serum Ca) = 9.7.
    *   Pt's Ca dose is within rec'd range. Corrected level is normal. No intervention required.
