Monitoring Long Term PN

<a id='fcea882c-c61e-4863-9eb4-05e8b5d3fb38'></a>

- Vitamins: A, E, 25-OHD every 3-6 months; B1, B6, B12, as appropriate
- Consider carnitine
- Trace elements: plasma Zn, Cu, Se, manganese (if on multitrace), urinary I every 3-6 months
- Essential fatty acid panel when deficiency suspected or using newer lipid sources
- Monitor for iron deficiency (no iron in PN)
- Nutrient levels should be obtained when patients uninfected and need to be interpreted in clinical context e.g., CRP

**X-axis:** Days of therapy, ranging from 0 to 60 for both panels.

**Control Panel (Left):**
- A solid black line shows a slight, almost flat, increase in predicted total bilirubin from approximately 5.5 mg/dL to 6 mg/dL over 60 days.
- A light grey shaded area surrounds the line, representing the confidence interval, which also remains relatively flat.

**Intravenous fat emulsion reduction Panel (Right):**
- A dashed-dotted black line shows a decrease in predicted total bilirubin from approximately 8.5 mg/dL to 3.5 mg/dL over 60 days.
- A light grey shaded area surrounds the line, representing the confidence interval, which shows a clear downward trend, narrowing slightly towards 60 days.

Omegaven 1g/kg/day
<::A box plot titled "Gura, 2008" shows Direct bilirubin, mg/dL on the y-axis (ranging from 0 to 20) and Weeks from baseline (fish oil started) on the x-axis. The x-axis labels are -8 (20), -4 (27), 0 (18), 4 (33), 8 (29), 12 (22), 16 (15), 20 (7), 24 (3), 28 (2), 32 (4), 36 (3). A horizontal dashed line is present at approximately 2 mg/dL on the y-axis. The box plots show that direct bilirubin levels are elevated before week 0 (baseline), with medians generally between 4 and 6 mg/dL. After week 0, the bilirubin levels progressively decrease, with most box plots showing medians below the 2 mg/dL dashed line from week 12 onwards, indicating a reduction in direct bilirubin over time after fish oil treatment started.

<::A line chart titled "Diamond, 2009" displays Bilirubin (umol/L) on the y-axis against Time (weeks) on the x-axis. The y-axis ranges from 0 to 270 umol/L, with major tick marks every 20 units. The x-axis ranges from 0 to 50 weeks, with major tick marks every 10 weeks. Multiple colored lines (approximately 10-12) are plotted, showing various trends of Bilirubin levels over time. Some lines show a decrease, some an increase, and some remain relatively stable.: chart::>

Liposyn Minimization, 1g/kg twice weekly
<::A line chart titled "Total Bilirubin" shows the trend of Total Bilirubin (mg/dL) over time. The Y-axis ranges from 0 to 18 mg/dL, with major grid lines at intervals of 2. The X-axis represents "Time (date)" with labels from 2/11/2007 to 9/9/2007, approximately every two weeks. The line graph starts around 2 mg/dL on 2/11/2007, dips to about 1 mg/dL by 2/25/2007, then steadily increases, reaching a peak of approximately 15 mg/dL around 5/6/2007. After this peak, it fluctuates slightly but generally decreases, falling below 2 mg/dL by 7/29/2007 and remaining low, near 0 mg/dL, until 9/9/2007.

<::Line chart titled "SMOFlipid 2g/kg/d" from Rafeeq, 2009. The y-axis ranges from 0 to 350, with major ticks at 50-unit intervals. The x-axis is labeled "time" and shows intervals from "pre" (pre-treatment) to "12m" (12 months). Multiple colored lines with various markers (circles, squares, triangles, crosses) and line styles (solid, dashed, dotted) are plotted. Most lines show an initial fluctuation or increase, followed by a general decrease over time, eventually approaching values near zero. For example, a solid black line with circles starts high, decreases sharply, then levels off. A dashed green line with circles starts high, fluctuates, then decreases gradually. A dashed red line with squares shows an initial increase, then a sharp decrease. A dashed orange line with triangles shows an initial increase, then a sharp decrease. A dashed purple line with triangles shows a sharp increase followed by a sharp decrease. A dashed blue line with triangles starts low, increases slightly, then decreases and levels off. A solid magenta line with triangles starts low, decreases, then levels off. A dashed black line with crosses shows an initial decrease, then an increase, then a decrease.: chart::>

Omegaven® Guidelines

*   “Initiate dosing in PN-dependent pediatric patients as soon as direct (or conjugated) bilirubin levels are **2mg/dL** or greater”
*   “Omegaven is not indicated for the prevention of PNAC”
*   LPCHS policy recommends against starting Omegaven in infants < 2 wks old with cholestasis (PNAC presents after at least 14 days of PN)
*   Prior to starting Omegaven®, make sure the direct **bilirubin ≥ 2 mg/dL is not from infection** (check CBC, U/A, urine C+S, blood C+S as indicated)
*   GI consult is required to approve use

Board Question

<a id='d62e4d39-e3b9-4475-81b4-e8680ef9b31f'></a>

Children on parenteral nutrition are at risk for zinc deficiency, which may manifest as which of the following?

<a id='0f52e733-6084-4236-ba1b-7edce6428608'></a>

A. Constipation
B. Poor wound healing and low alkaline phosphatase
C. Thrombocytopenia
D. Psychosis

<a id='34221ed3-858d-408d-95fa-1117f4a64cd9'></a>

**Answer:** B. Poor wound healing and low alkaline phosphatase.
Zinc is a mineral that is important for wound healing and bone health. Low zinc is associated with diarrhea, and results in poor wound healing and low alkaline phosphatase.

1.  **Organic layer attachment**: Small, irregular red particles are shown adhering to the inner surface of the catheter.
2.  **Bacterial colonisation & multiplication**: More red particles, some appearing as small clusters, are shown multiplying on the surface.
3.  **Formation of protective exopolymer saccharides**: The bacterial clusters are now embedded within a larger, irregular white matrix, indicating the formation of a protective exopolymer. Two yellow arrows point to this stage, with accompanying text:
    *   "Biofilm impenetrable to host immune response"
    *   "Biofilm impenetrable to antibiotics"
4.  **Dispersal of Biofilm Matrix**: Further along the catheter, parts of the red and white biofilm matrix are shown detaching and dispersing into the lumen of the catheter.

<::A man wearing a black San Francisco Giants baseball cap, sunglasses, and a black jacket holds up a white sign with the letters "TPN" in black. He is standing in what appears to be a dugout or covered area at a baseball field, with a green wall behind him. In the background, other people are visible, along with a "NO SMOKING" sign and a banner that partially shows the word "GIANTS".

Abstract: Ethanol lock therapy has been implemented to prevent infections of central venous catheters as well as to treat infections. Fungal catheter-associated blood stream infections are historically more difficult to treat and have required removal of central venous catheters. We report the largest case series to date, successfully treating 5 of 7 fungal catheter-associated blood stream infections with ethanol lock therapy and systemic echinocandin administration.

<::An illustration depicts a light blue, spherical cartoon character wearing a yellow hard hat. The character has simple facial features, including two black eyes, eyebrows, and a small mouth. It is sitting down, with two orange, heart-shaped feet visible. The character is holding a red, rectangular Lego-like block in its right hand, appearing to add it to a structure being built on its right side. This structure is made of various colored Lego-like blocks (red, blue, yellow, green) stacked in an irregular, somewhat tall formation. To the character's left, there is a yellow, open-top box labeled "AMINO ACIDS" in dark blue text. Inside the box, there is a blue Lego-like block, and a green Lego-like block is sitting on the ground just outside the box. The background is plain white.
