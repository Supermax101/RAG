The appropriate use of this complex therapy aims to maximize clinical benefit while minimizing the potential risk for adverse events. Despite being classified and acknowledged as a high-alert medication,¹ only 58% of organizations have precautions in place to prevent errors and patient harm associated with PN.² Complications can occur as a result of the therapy and as the result of the PN process. These recommendations are based on practices that are generally accepted to minimize errors with PN therapy. However, the broad range of healthcare settings in which PN administration occurs—from critical care to home care—raises the potential for disparities to\n\n<a id='83152221-2618-47e8-b638-bb87f5c89029'></a>\n\nexist in the knowledge and skills of the healthcare professionals responsible for PN prescribing, review, compounding, and administration. Regardless of the setting or the number of patients treated in a given facility, the classification of PN as a high-alert medication requires healthcare organizations to develop evidence-based policies and procedures related to PN.\n\n<a id='49996e4d-e789-47f3-9971-0088d5e438f4'></a>\n\nFrom ¹Baptist Health Systems, Department of Pharmacy, Jackson,\nMississippi; ²Vitaline Infusion Pharmacy Services, Geisinger Medical\nCenter, Danville, Pennsylvania; ³University of Pennsylvania, School\nof Nursing, Philadelphia; ⁴Butler University College of Pharmacy and\nHealth Science, Indianapolis, Indiana; ⁵American Society for Parenteral\nand Enteral Nutrition, Silver Spring, Maryland; ⁶University of Michigan\nHealth System, Department of Pharmacy Services, Ann Arbor; ⁷Walgreens\nInfusion Services, Sun Valley, California; ⁸Infusion Pharmacy, Cleveland\nClinic at Home, Independence, Ohio; ⁹Department of Pharmacy Practice,\nHarrison School of Pharmacy, Auburn University, Auburn, Alabama;\n¹⁰Division of Preventive Medicine and Nutrition, New York Presbyterian\nHospital-Columbia University Medical Center, New York; ¹¹Thomas\nJefferson University Hospital, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\n<a id='666a3fa4-4fd2-4c20-9ae6-740cefc9f6ec'></a>\n\nReceived for publication October 3, 2013; accepted for publication\nOctober 3, 2013.\n\n<a id='94a2fe83-01bc-4567-9fa9-92fb6f33a294'></a>\n\nThis article originally appeared online on November 26, 2013.\n\n<a id='e9d9e20e-f89e-49e4-8c8b-53317370513f'></a>\n\n**Corresponding Author:**\nPeggi Guenter, A.S.P.E.N., Silver Spring, MD, USA.\nEmail: peggig@aspen.nutr.org\n\n<a id='9a58f883-de96-45b3-aadd-017096aba432'></a>\n\nAyers et al\n\n<a id='e0a9245d-3461-46dd-9776-9786af22c2ca'></a>\n\nCAPTION ERROR\n\n<a id='f95d4ce5-0dd4-4605-8ef8-a1c374647990'></a>\n\nConceptually, the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (A.S.P.E.N.) recommends use of the standardized process, which includes clinicians with expertise in the area of nutrition support.³\n\n<a id='88d4559a-af5e-4965-8f4e-cb5732e72681'></a>\n\nDuring the past few years, many circumstances and incidents have threatened the safety of patients receiving PN as an important therapy. In light of the need to revise A.S.P.E.N.'s *Safe Practices for Parenteral Nutrition* guidelines and to publicly address the safety of PN prescribing, compounding, and delivery, A.S.P.E.N. leaders hosted a multiorganizational safety summit on September 23, 2011. This summit brought together 46 key stakeholders to identify processes to improve the safety of prescribing, preparing, and delivering PN to patients across a variety of healthcare settings. Findings from this summit guided the A.S.P.E.N. PN Safety Task Force to develop safety consensus recommendations.\n\n<a id='1d3b3734-f5d9-42c8-b20c-3d6a90e48af5'></a>\n\nIn an attempt to answer as many questions about PN safety as possible, this Task Force, in partnership with the A.S.P.E.N. Clinical Practice Guidelines Editorial Board PN workgroup, developed many clinical questions still unanswered in existing documents. The workgroups were divided into two segments, each responsible for specific tasks. The first group developed questions that could be answered with a high level of confi- dence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) process (the process by which the A.S.P.E.N. Clinical Guidelines are developed).⁵ The second group developed questions for which the level of evidence in the literature did not support any GRADE-level recommendations, meaning that consensus recommendations would depend on expert opinion. This paper addresses clinical concerns that impact PN safety for which current literature does not provide GRADE-level evidence and provides consen- sus recommendations for safe PN practice and future research based on expert opinion. These recommendations are not clini- cal guidelines as defined by A.S.P.E.N.⁶ The need to deliver practice information to clinicians, even when it is of a consen- sus nature from practice experts, remains an important role of A.S.P.E.N. Redundancies were deliberately built into this doc- ument between sections for users who may only view individ- ual sections based on their practice area. Reviewers of this paper included the A.S.P.E.N. Clinical Practice Committee, Dietetics Practice, Medical Practice, Nutrition Support Nurses, and Pharmacy Practice Sections, as well as clinical content experts outside of the organization. This document was also reviewed and approved by the A.S.P.E.N. Board of Directors. The questions to be answered with the Clinical Practice Guidelines GRADE process, listed in Appendix 1, will be addressed by a separate workgroup and published separately. This document should be used in conjunction with those guidelines.\n\n<a id='f8afc0e0-376a-4d84-ba85-22db1ef4a576'></a>\n\nSimilar to A.S.P.E.N.'s Standards of Practice documents,\nthe following terminology is used with each recommendation\n\n<a id='6b1e013a-3986-41b6-b483-3dfadc1aa655'></a>\n\nto indicate the level of evidence and strength of consensus\nreached for each statement.\n\n<a id='80875b23-10b1-475a-bfbe-10d53d389f30'></a>\n\n\"Shall\": Indicates that the recommendation is to be fol-\nlowed strictly.\n\n<a id='f5239f02-d17b-490d-88c0-f5b29623141a'></a>\n\n\"Should\": Indicates that among several possibilities, one is particularly suitable, without mentioning or excluding others, or that a certain course of action is preferred, but not necessarily required.\n\n\"May\": Indicates a course of action that is permissible within the limits of recommended practice.\n\n<a id='1ac65d9f-2be4-4360-b213-256e25d449d3'></a>\n\nThe recommendations within this document are intended for discussion and adoption over time by organizations and individual professionals involved in the routine care of patients requiring PN. These **recommendations are not intended to supersede the judgment of the healthcare professional based on the circumstances of the individual patient.** Although the substantial focus of these recommendations is on institutional settings, many of the safety issues exist across other patient-care settings. Concerns that are unique to home care are also addressed where appropriate. In every clinical setting, it is the responsibility of the prescriber, pharmacist, nurse, dietitian, and nutrition support team to recognize and report all PN-related medication errors, whether or not they reach the patient. This allows the medication safety officer/committee to review and address these events periodically with the committee or individuals having oversight of PN.\n\n<a id='a113af2e-8727-4033-a411-bb3741453ea3'></a>\n\n# References\n\n1.

Deaths have occurred when safe practice guidelines were not followed.1 Appropriate and safe prescribing and ordering of PN is a critical first step and an essential component of the PN use process. The safe prescribing of PN requires a thorough knowledge of protein and energy requirements, macronutrients, micronutrients, fluid homeostasis, and acid-base balance. The prescriber shall be well versed in the appropriate indications for PN, basics in sterility and infection control, as well as vascular access devices (peripheral and central) and their associated complications. Safe prescribing of PN begins with PN-specific interdisciplinary education and institutional policies focused on writing clear PN orders. Furthermore, there shall be clear means of communication among physicians, physician extenders/mid-level providers (eg, nurse practitioners, physician assistants), dietitians, pharmacists, and nurses involved in this process. This section provides guidance and suggestions for healthcare institutions to adopt in order to promote safe prescribing of PN. Many of these recommendations have been adapted from literature of another high-alert therapy: cancer chemotherapy.2-4\n\n<a id='ff469448-4740-49ce-b992-e3e88b89bf53'></a>\n\nQuestion: Prescribing 1–2 (P1–P2)\n\n<a id='3039a3e1-2b18-41d2-8add-12510999a739'></a>\n\n(P1) Does a standardized process for PN prescribing increase clarity and reduce PN-related errors?

Healthcare organizations shall use a standardized pro-cess for PN management, and this process shall include clinicians with expertise in the area of nutrition sup-port, preferably from multiple disciplines.<sup>5,6</sup>\n   a. Healthcare organizations shall develop written policies and procedures for all aspects of PN ther-apy in the manner described in the A.S.P.E.N. *Safe Practices for Parenteral Nutrition*.<sup>1</sup>\n   b. The patient and caregivers shall be informed of the risks and benefits associated with PN.\n   c. A comprehensive PN education program and competency assessment shall be developed for healthcare professionals who are involved in the care of patients receiving PN therapy, and competency should be assessed at least annu-ally.<sup>4</sup>\n   d. Healthcare organizations shall have a writ-ten policy addressing credentials, training, and\n\n<a id='d1a3c515-1f33-4b78-8546-22b130f96792'></a>\n\ncompetency certification(s) required of clinicians who prescribe PN.⁴\n\n2. The primary healthcare team, in collaboration with nutrition support professionals, shall evaluate, clearly define, and accurately document the patient's medical problem(s) and indication(s) for PN.\n   a. The patient shall have an appropriate indication for PN therapy based on published guidelines and evidence for the use of PN, which shall be documented in the medical record.¹\n   b. The healthcare team shall confirm that the patient has appropriate intravenous (IV) access for PN prior to prescribing PN therapy.¹\n   c. The indication(s) for PN and appropriate IV access shall be included on the PN order (see section 4 and Table 1).¹\n\n3. The primary healthcare team, in collaboration with nutrition support professionals, shall specify and document the therapeutic goal(s) of PN therapy.\n   a. Appropriate energy and protein goals shall be determined for the patient's condition based on published guidelines and evidence.¹\n   b. Appropriate parameters and frequency of monitoring shall be determined for the patient's condition to assess efficacy, detect and prevent complications, evaluate changes, and document outcomes.¹\n   c. Appropriate monitoring parameters for PN shall include fluid requirements, serum electrolyte concentrations, serum glucose concentrations, hepatic function, renal function, serum triglyceride concentrations, and signs or symptoms of vascular access device complications.¹\n   d. Therapeutic goals should be established for PN, including end points, response to treatment, and treatment failure.\n\n4. PN shall be prescribed using a standardized PN order format and review process applicable to patients of every age and disease state within a healthcare organization. ¹,⁶\n   a. Standardized electronic PN orders (eg, a computerized prescriber order entry [CPOE] system) should be used to prescribe PN for all patients. ¹,⁷⁻⁹ Handwritten orders to prescribe PN should be avoided due to potential for error. Verbal and telephone orders for PN should be avoided.\n   b. Clinical decision support should be available within electronic PN orders to alert and prevent prescribers from ordering doses of macronutrients, micronutrients, and/or medications that exceed recommended/safe clinical limits or that exceed limits of compatibility (eg, hard limits when maximum concentrations have been exceeded). ¹,⁷,⁸\n\n<a id='08cf4124-e9bd-4001-b2d4-79a1b13517a8'></a>\n\nCAPTION ERROR\n\n<a id='a6053387-2469-48bb-8dec-6b32349fe448'></a>\n\nCAPTION ERROR\n\n<a id='df88dc18-9bf7-4438-9ec7-19799fd88d8f'></a>\n\nc. When a CPOE system is not available, PN should be prescribed using a standardized order template as an editable electronic document in order to avoid handwritten orders.\nd. PN order templates shall be designed so they are clear and easily understood by all healthcare professionals involved in the care of patients receiving PN.¹\ne. Table 1 lists components that shall be included on the PN order. ¹,⁴\nf. All PN order templates should include the required components listed in the sequence in Table 1. This sequence should match the PN labels as well. See Figure 1 and Figure 2 for PN Order Templates.\ng. In the event of a product shortage, PN component conservation and allocation strategies should include the A.S.P.E.N. parenteral nutrition shortage considerations for multivitamins, trace elements, IV fat emulsions (IVFE), amino acids, electrolyte/minerals, and cysteine, ¹⁰⁻¹⁵ and the PN order format should be updated accordingly. Multivitamins shall be prescribed daily in PN admixtures. When multivitamin products are not available, thiamine, ascorbic acid, pyridoxine, and folic acid should be prescribed daily. ¹⁰\nh. All PN ingredients shall be ordered in amounts per day (eg, for adult patients) or amounts per kilogram per day (eg, pediatric and neonatal patients) rather than in amounts per liter, percent concentration, or volume.¹ Amount per day refers to macronutrients in grams per day, and micronutrients in mEq, mmol, mcg, or mg per day. Electrolytes shall be ordered as the complete salt form rather than the individual ion.¹ Each individual macronutrient and micronutrient ordered shall be listed with its corresponding dose.¹ If available, the total ion amounts and concentrations may be reported or displayed to the prescriber within the PN order.\ni. The PN order template in CPOE systems should display current patient monitoring values and their date and time of entry to include parameters such as laboratory values, temperature, weight, etc.\nj. The PN order template should contain the full generic name for each ingredient. ¹,⁴ Proprietary names should only be used when multiple products exist and/or when the proprietary name may assist in identifying unique properties of the specific dosage form (eg, inherent electrolytes in amino acid formulations, fatty acids in IVFE). Any abbreviations shall follow The Joint Commission standards on abbreviations. ⁴,¹⁶ Abbreviations on\n\n<a id='4705f1f4-52bd-433a-abaa-2e84c2b82538'></a>\n\nthe Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP)\nlist of error-prone abbreviations, symbols, and\ndose designations shall not be used.<sup>17</sup>\nk. The PN order should include related orders for\nroutine care, laboratory tests, and relevant moni-\ntoring parameters.<sup>1</sup>\nl. Prescribing a PN formulation that includes non-\nnutrient medications should be avoided. When no\nother reasonable alternatives exist, non-nutrient\nmedications shall only be included on the PN\norder if data support compatibility/stability.<sup>1</sup>\nm. Healthcare organizations should develop poli-\ncies and/or protocols to allow modification of PN\norders when potential incompatibilities may exist\n(eg, incompatibilities associated with calcium and\nphosphate salts, adjustment of IVFE dosing when\nit is not expected to be stable as a total nutrient\nadmixture [TNA] [ordering IVFE separately or\nadjusting IVFE dosing such that the daily dose\nachieves minimum concentration for stability]).<sup>1</sup>\nAll PN order modifications shall be communi-\ncated to the healthcare team and documented in\nthe medical record. PN orders shall be signed by a\nlicensed prescriber who has been credentialed by\nthe healthcare organization to prescribe PN.<sup>4</sup>\nn. PN orders should be prescribed with a time limi-\ntation to allow for appropriate patient evaluation\nat predetermined intervals based on clinical status\nand required level of care.<sup>1-4</sup>\no. For optimal safety, PN orders should be pre-\nscribed and transmitted when supported by prop-\nerly trained personnel who regularly perform\nthis task. This is usually done during daytime\nhours.<sup>18</sup>\n5. Institutions shall create a home PN order template/for-\nmat that provides a safe plan for multiple days of ther-\napy. The prescription for home PN therapy should be\nwritten in a format that specifically reflects trends in\nlaboratory values and previous days of PN therapy. An\ninstitutional daily PN order format should not be used\nas a home PN prescription.\n6. The most appropriate nutrition modality, in collabora-\ntion with nutrition support professionals, should be\nprescribed for the patient. Healthcare organizations\nshould determine the most appropriate types of PN\nformulation(s) for their patient population(s) (eg, stan-\ndardized compounded, standardized commercial [pre-\nmixed] PN products, or customized compounded PN\nadmixtures) or methods of delivery (eg, dextrose/\namino acid vs total nutrient admixtures) and should\ndevelop criteria for each formulation that will be used\nin their patients.<sup>19</sup>\n\n<a id='fc05c8ba-f0cb-4c26-a629-75baa70c5a63'></a>\n\nCAPTION ERROR\n\n<a id='d3e88dd3-f67a-4e03-8444-af2f65636166'></a>\n\nJournal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition 38(3)\n\n<a id='7608b000-1414-46d8-a9c1-1e488bfd8e9f'></a>\n\nTable 1.

The World Health Organization (WHO) advocates a systematic approach to prescribing in order to improve quality and minimize errors.² Pollock and colleagues described considering drug costs and using computer technology when prescribing medications.³ These approaches provide an excellent template for the clinician prescribing PN. The A.S.P.E.N. *Safe Practices for PN* document describes the benefits of using a standardized PN ordering process and recommends components that should be included on a PN order template (mandatory, strongly recommended, and worthy of consideration).¹\n\nLike PN, chemotherapy is a class of complex prescription medications with critical safety concerns. The American Society of Clinical Oncology and Oncology Nursing Society developed Chemotherapy Administration Safety Standards in the outpatient setting in 2009,²⁰ with revisions to expand these to the inpatient setting in 2011.⁴ The concepts in these safety standards are consistent with the A.S.P.E.N. Safe Practices for PN. We recommend that healthcare organizations and clinicians adopt these standards and guidelines when creating policies for ordering/prescribing PN.¹⁻⁴\n\n<a id='b7088134-f0f9-4150-8a4c-87625fdc0d7d'></a>\n\nStandardized order formats for PN incorporating prescriber guidelines can provide education that can lead to reduced prescribing errors, improved efficiency/productivity, and ultimately reduced costs and waste. In addition, adopting a standardized PN order format designed with ingredients listed in the same sequence may improve consistency, and clarifying orders decreases the risk of errors when patients transition care from one setting to another. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality recently reported on a meaningful reduction in errors (from 9 to 2 per 1000 PN orders) at a children's hospital that adopted a standardized ordering and administration process for PN. Other observations included a reduced need for pharmacists to correct orders, a more efficient ordering and administration process, earlier delivery and administration, and an associated increase in staff satisfaction.⁶\n\n<a id='a1dc5ba7-d901-4c60-9369-fa5ffa9d5c14'></a>\n\nThe use of electronic or computerized PN orders can also improve efficiency and safety and reduce errors.

The worksheet was developed using commonly available\nspreadsheet software (ie, not part of an integrated CPOE sys-\ntem), but still required separate entry and transcription of the PN\norder. While use of the worksheet was associated with a reduc-\ntion in the prescribing error rate, all of the errors that did occur\nwere attributed to transcription or data entry mistakes.⁹\nShamliyan and colleagues completed a review of studies to\nexamine the association between computerization of physician\norders and prescribing medication orders.⁸ Computerized orders\nwere associated with a 43% reduction in dosing errors, 37.5%\nreduction in adverse drug events, and 66% reduction in total pre-\nscribing errors in adults.⁸ Of the studies included in this review,\n80% reported a significant reduction in total prescribing errors.⁸\nWhile these data are not specific to PN therapy, they do highlight\nthe benefits of CPOE on the medication use process and associ-\nated errors and adverse drug events.\n\n<a id='246fd9f4-de44-491d-bbf5-205846f7da9a'></a>\n\nThe ISMP reported a case of a 16-year-old boy who received a PN order in which the ingredients were ordered in amounts per kg, but the PN admixture was prepared in amounts per day.²¹ This resulted in infusion of a hypo-osmolar PN admixture (138 mOsm/L) with very low doses of nutrients (eg, protein and dextrose both at 1 g/d rather than 1 g/kg/d) for almost an entire day before it was identified (no adverse effects were incurred by the patient). There were multiple failures across the entire medication use process in this scenario. For example, the PN order template in the CPOE system did not match the template in the pharmacy system/Automated Compounding Device (ACD). Further, there was a lack of clinical decision support and automated warnings in both the CPOE PN order template and the ACD, a lack of redundancies in the process, and multiple points of transcription. ISMP provided several safe practice recommendations²¹:\n\n<a id='c481999a-e792-484e-8b57-306651ac7bf1'></a>\n\nCAPTION ERROR\n\n<a id='34fe4ff2-6a84-4540-b5cf-ab163b1d08a0'></a>\n\nJournal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition 38(3)\n\n<a id='65d91626-90f8-4e7f-bfbd-60dd621aacef'></a>\n\nPatient Information\n\nPatient name____________________ Medical record number____________________ Birthdate/age____\nPatient location____________________ Allergies____________________\n\nHeight and dosing weight: Ht:____ cm Dosing Wt:____ kg\nDiagnosis(es)/Indication(s) for PN____________________\nVascular access device/location CVC type____________________ Location____________________\nAdministration date/time____________________\n\nBase Formula\nAmino acids g\nDextrose g\nIV Fat emulsion g\nElectrolytes\nSodium phosphate mmol\nSodium chloride mEq\nSodium acetate mEq\nPotassium phosphate mmol\nPotassium chloride mEq\nPotassium acetate mEq\nMagnesium sulfate mEq\nCalcium gluconate mEq\nVitamins, Trace Elements, Additives\nMulti-component vitamins mL\nMulti-component trace elements mL\nOther Additives (eg, cysteine, regular insulin) as clinically appropriate and compatible\n\nPN Instructions\nTotal volume____ mL Infusion rate____ mL/hr , start and stop times____\nCycle information____________________\nPrescriber and contact information____________________\n\n<a id='ded021e9-80b1-44ed-96b2-d5de8fce6a5f'></a>\n\n**Figure 2.** Parenteral Nutrition Order Template: Pediatric/Neonatal Patient.\n\n<a id='81ca0938-ff32-4262-9a35-34396df013b6'></a>\n\n- Match prescribing and pharmacy templates\n- Build, test, and heed automated warnings\n- Heighten suspicions of errors\n- Carry out effective redundancies\n- Provide clear labeling (and the label should always match the PN order template in the PN order form/ CPOE system and the ACD)\n- Educate and validate competency\n- Eliminate transcription of PN orders\n\n<a id='fed47019-8efb-4814-80c5-6511c7132522'></a>\n\nDespite the potential advantages of CPOE, use of CPOE with respect to PN orders appears to be limited. A 2011 survey of PN practices noted that a CPOE system was used for PN orders in only 33% of the surveyed organizations.²² Most recently, Radley et al conducted a systematic review of the literature and derived a summary estimate of the effect of CPOE using a random effects meta-analytic technique. Their pooled analysis revealed that implementing CPOE was associated with a 48% (95% CI,\n\n<a id='9c4259b3-8f4b-4d3a-917f-32f57b639cb7'></a>\n\n41%–55%) reduction in medication error rates. They further\nestimated that as many as 104 million medication errors could be\naverted annually if all hospitals fully adopted CPOE to process\nall medication orders. 23 To the best of our knowledge, only one\nlarge commercial Health Information System–Electronic\nMedical Record/CPOE system provides even rudimentary PN\ncalculation or decision support capability.\n\n<a id='00917a1e-3ac9-4c5d-8ae2-13b6daa63f48'></a>\n\nQuestion: Prescribing 3 (P3)\n\n(P3) What improvements in the physical environment would promote safe PN ordering and use?\n\n<a id='b5293c9f-62ca-4480-8bcb-de4934e29786'></a>\n\n*Recommendations*\nInstitutions shall meet the following requirements for the physi-\ncal environment as described in The United States Pharmacopeial\nConvention, USP General Chapter <1066>:\n\n<a id='15c468f2-4ff1-4074-b465-68e9334d8dbc'></a>\n\nAyers et al\n\n<a id='94f513e8-253c-4b3f-b2c0-d8e3184f8fec'></a>\n\nCAPTION ERROR\n\n<a id='a928f322-dfb9-480f-9322-6720e584fec5'></a>\n\n1. Illumination: USP <1066> recommends the following lighting levels for healthcare settings²⁴:\n   Computer order entry 1000 Lux\n   Handwritten order processing 1000 Lux\n   Sterile compounding and preparation 1000–1500 Lux\n   Medication preparation area 1000 Lux\n   Medication administration work area 1000 Lux\n2. Interruptions and distractions: The 2008 USP MEDMARX Data Reports noted distractions rank high (approximately 45%) as contributing to medication errors in hospitals and health systems.²⁵\n3. Sound and noise: The standard for sound levels for medication safety zones is set at 50 decibels A-weighted for sound (dBA), the level of conversation.²⁴\n4. Physical design and organization of work space: The design of the workplace environment can influence the effectiveness of the prescriber to perform tasks.²⁴ USP <1066> promotes ergonomic design of the workplace environment. Factors such as counter height, height of supplies, drawer lighting, and work clutter are noted to influence efficiency as well as safety.\n5. Medication safety zones: Defined as a critical area where medications are prescribed, orders are entered into a computer or transcribed onto paper documents, and where medications are prepared, dispensed, or administered.²⁴\n\n<a id='82510afb-a9eb-44b9-a5a3-0048c246eb13'></a>\n\n# Rationale\n\nThe process of ordering/prescribing PN is very complex and requires an environment that promotes safety. According to the United States Pharmacopeia (USP), the work environment has been identified as one of the most common reported factors known to contribute to medication errors.²⁴ In October 2010, The United States Pharmacopeial Convention published an official bulletin titled *Physical Environments That Promote Safe Medication Use, General Chapter <1066>*. This chapter focuses on the characteristics of the physical environment that are essential to promoting accurate medication use.²⁴ These guidelines provide an excellent resource to promote safe prescribing for the nutrition support clinicians to incorporate into their practice.\n\n<a id='a3b4eb2b-9dc5-4182-aa18-297b102500ad'></a>\n\n**Question: Prescribing 4 (P4)**\n(P4) How often should the PN prescription be reordered after\nthe initial order?\n\n1. An institution-specific or organization-specific policy\nshould be created to dictate the duration of a PN\norder.\n\n<a id='cede35ab-2c85-411c-814e-72ab02de3811'></a>\n\n2. When reordering PN, each PN component should be reordered in its entirety, including full generic names and doses.\n3. Patients with newly initiated PN should be monitored and have their orders reviewed more frequently.\n4. The reordering process should be structured to require accountability for reviewing the orders, laboratory findings, and patient's condition. Simple processes (eg, a single-step \"renew order\" button) that lack this accountability should not be used. The following are categories for patients and examples for their corre-sponding monitoring frequencies:\n   a. Patients who are new to PN should be monitored daily until stable (more frequently if clinically significant metabolic abnormalities are found or patient is at risk for refeeding syndrome).\n   b. Patients in an unstable clinical condition (eg, acutely ill, critically ill, recovering from critical illness, recent surgery) should be monitored daily until stable (more frequently if clinically signifi-cant abnormalities are observed).\n   c. Stable patients in the hospital with no required changes in formulation for 1 week should be mon-itored every 2 to 7 days.\n   d. Stable patients in a hospital, long-term care, or home setting with no changes in formulation for more than 1 week should be monitored every 1 to 4 weeks or longer in select clinically stable patients.\n\n<a id='f493cd5c-5414-4d45-8ef3-5f7a119b17f7'></a>\n\n# Rationale\n\nThere are no known studies that examine whether the duration of a PN order or the frequency with which such orders are renewed impacts outcomes or safety measures. However, the collaborative multidisciplinary care approach and application of safe practices guidelines have repeatedly proven to reduce complications, costs, and inappropriate use of PN.²⁶ It is reasonable to assume that patients newly initiated on PN, especially those with preexisting electrolyte abnormalities or at risk for refeeding syndrome or with unstable clinical status (such as those newly critically ill or postoperative patients), will require more frequent monitoring. Similarly, patients who have been stable for some time may need less frequent monitoring. Policies regarding the frequency of PN order renewals improve monitoring practices. Protocols for ordering PN may be designed such that laboratory values must be entered or acknowledged prior to submitting the order as is common in home infusion practice. Published guidelines and literature on prescribing should be adopted and reinforced and each healthcare organization shall include clinicians with expertise in the area of nutrition support, preferably from multiple disciplines in the prescribing process.⁵,⁶\n\n<a id='d4248182-2e12-4a23-9d12-ce65af1416bc'></a>\n\n304\n\n<a id='2dfcec0e-09fc-4db4-9960-9435ea32d943'></a>\n\nJournal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition 38(3)\n\n<a id='7b9de34b-14de-4d6a-be03-d5bc2115a938'></a>\n\nQuestion: Prescribing 5 (P5)\n(P5) How can education be provided to non-nutrition support\nspecialist clinicians to improve PN prescribing and safety?\n\n<a id='d4421708-cebb-467e-aa51-018e27e67cb5'></a>\n\nRecommendations\n1. Prescribers from all disciplines, including physicians, pharmacists, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and dietitians, should be educated on basic PN prescribing and monitoring.\n2. Introductory didactic and experiential education/training about PN should be included in the core curriculum. Knowledge and skills should be evaluated for all clinicians in each discipline involved with PN as determined by the individual institution. Education and assessment materials and processes shall be developed and led by clinicians with expertise in the area of nutrition support, preferably from multiple disciplines.5,6\n3. In-depth education on PN should be included as a standard component of acute care and home care pharmacy and physician residency training. This is also applicable to all pharmacists, nurses, dietitians, physicians, physician extenders, and other clinicians involved in caring for patients who receive PN.\n\n<a id='7d0809c4-5542-41e4-b22e-a41c10742371'></a>\n\n## Rationale\n\nThere are few known studies evaluating the impact of safe prescribing education programs on the outcomes of patients receiving PN. Interdisciplinary teams, applying education as part of an overall quality intervention, have been successful in reducing unnecessary PN use and decreasing errors.²⁰ In general, participating in PN education programs has been associated with improvement in safer prescribing practices.²⁷ Such programs are well received by students who perceive a large gap in their training in safe prescribing practices.²⁸⁻³⁰ Safe prescribing, both in general and specific to PN, should be a component of all clinical training, including the core curricula of professional programs (medical, pharmacy, advanced practice nurse prescribers, nursing, nutrition, physician assistant, etc), residency, and specialty/fellowship programs for all who may be engaged in prescribing PN.\n\n<a id='db103c81-391e-4b81-b322-73999e2db468'></a>\n\n*Topics for Further Research*\n\n1.

PN formulations may contain more than 40 ingredients, including amino acids, dextrose, IVFE, electrolytes, vitamins, trace elements, insulin, and other medications. PN is considered a high-alert medication because significant patient harm may occur when this therapy is used in error.<sup>1,2</sup> A critical step in the PN process is a pharmacist's review and verification of PN orders. Breaches in the review and verification processes have resulted in errors and patient harm.<sup>1</sup> Healthcare organizations have the opportunity to improve the safety of PN therapy by optimizing technology for prescribing PN and transmitting PN order information as well as standardizing the PN review and verification processes.\n\n<a id='4337cfc4-ad4b-4ef2-a1a1-f0ed0891ff00'></a>\n\nQuestion: Verification 1 (V1)\n\n(V1) What are the essential components or attributes for safely transmitting PN orders to pharmacists for review and verification?\n\n<a id='b7fbb2fa-2499-45c0-86e9-60f92efed74c'></a>\n\n*Recommendations*\n\n1. PN should be prescribed using a CPOE system that is fully integrated with an automated compounding device (ACD). \"Fully integrated\" is described to mean that the order entered into the CPOE system is trans-mitted electronically to the ACD without requiring reentry of any data and any modifications to an order are electronically transmitted back to the CPOE system for physician approval and signature.\n2. When PN formulations are outsourced to a third-party vendor for compounding, PN orders should be pre-scribed using a CPOE system and electronically trans-mitted to the vendor to avoid transcription errors.\n3. In the absence of a fully integrated system, PN should be prescribed using a standardized order template as an\n\n<a id='b6a21263-06a0-464e-a619-3aa16b9e5d1b'></a>\n\nCAPTION ERROR\n\n<a id='47eddc0b-d1eb-4841-b7d1-60d314c5eb5a'></a>\n\nJournal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition 38(3)\n\n<a id='c0a84cc6-b318-4dcc-b506-a86821ed1408'></a>\n\neditable electronic document in order to avoid hand-written orders.\n4. Verbal and telephone orders for PN should be avoided except for pharmacist to prescriber communication to modify or clarify the order.\n5. PN order data should be in a standardized format, including standardized sequence of ingredients, standard units, standard formulas, and formulation options¹ as described above in the Questions (P1–P2).\n6. If transcription into the ACD is required, the output of the PN order data should be formatted to support direct entry into the ACD without requiring reordering of the ingredients, manual calculations of amounts, or unit-of-measure conversions.\n7. Data should only be manually transcribed from the PN order into the ACD when absolutely necessary. Transcribed data should always be double-checked by independent processes to monitor accuracy.⁴ Multiple manual transcriptions of PN order data should be avoided.\n8. PN orders should be prescribed, transmitted, and compounded when supported by properly trained personnel who regularly perform this task.⁵ This is usually during the daytime hours.\n9. Vendors and application architects for CPOE systems should place priority on developing pathways for prescribing PN that support the prescriber with appropriate clinical decision support (as previously described), enforce standards of practice, and communicate directly with ACDs.\n10. Application vendors and application architects for CPOE systems should collaborate with ACD manufacturers to develop fully integrated systems.\n11. Application vendors and application architects for CPOE systems should collaborate with ACD manufacturers and outsourcing pharmacies to develop fully integrated systems.\n\n<a id='7ec82a47-04ae-4604-ba95-dd5eb1cee699'></a>\n\n# Rationale\n\nFew healthcare organizations currently use a CPOE system for prescribing PN formulations that is fully integrated with an ACD. While some healthcare organizations use a CPOE system for prescribing PN, the majority continue to use paper order forms to prescribe PN, including handwritten orders.⁶⁻⁸\n\nOutsourcing pharmacies receive PN data in a variety of formats, including handwritten forms, which are commonly transmitted to the pharmacy. This may necessitate unit-of-measure conversion calculations, data manipulation, and transcription, which may result in errors. Editable electronic documents allow prescribers to complete orders and avoid the risks associated with handwritten orders.⁹,¹⁰ The lack of integration of the PN order with an ACD requires the manual entry of PN order data, which may lead to transcription errors.¹¹ A recent survey of PN practices reported that more than half of PN orders are\n\n<a id='46729a98-8cf8-4881-857e-a6c63039c8bd'></a>\n\ntranscribed by a pharmacist from handwritten orders or a printed label or requisition.⁸ Two recent reports from the ISMP describe transcription errors. One was the death of a 6-week-old infant who received a dose of sodium 60 times the prescribed amount.¹² The second report describes a PN order data entry error in which nutrients were entered into an incorrect PN template, resulting in a patient receiving a hypotonic PN formulation.³ Sacks et al also described a PN system in which PN order data were transcribed from a handwritten order into a hospital pharmacy computer and then reentered into the ACD, thereby increasing the risk for transcription errors.¹¹ If the PN process requires transcriptions, limiting the number of times data are entered from one system to another will decrease the risk of data entry errors. PN errors associated with incorrect calculations or converting units of measure have been reported and may result in patient harm. The ISMP reported the death of a neonate who received PN that included zinc at a dose 1000 times the prescribed amount. This error was the result of a calculation error in converting mcg/100 mL to mcg/kg/d.⁵\n\n<a id='66b9f2c9-99e8-4514-9310-04b19ddf0bd3'></a>\n\nThere are numerous CPOE vendors but few offer templates for prescribing PN that are user-friendly, allow institution-spe-cific customization, or interface with an ACD. Although the number of orders for PN is a small percentage of the total num-ber of medications prescribed, it is one of the most complex and complicated therapies provided by pharmacies. A CPOE system that is fully integrated with an ACD improves the safety of the PN process.3\n\n<a id='797ba0f2-f559-4202-8308-a85486faa818'></a>\n\nQuestion: Verification 2 (V2)\n\n(V2) What improvements in the PN review and verification\nprocesses will enhance the safety of PN therapy?\n\n<a id='8d5967af-7db3-4ade-b58d-3fc5f308d9ea'></a>\n\nRecommendations\n\n1. Healthcare organizations shall have a written policy and procedure for pharmacists to review and verify PN orders.\n2. The review and verification of PN orders should be conducted in an environment without distractions.\n3. PN orders shall be reviewed by a knowledgeable and skilled pharmacist to assess that the order is clear and complete.\n4. The PN order shall include the following elements:\n   a. Complete patient identifiers (patient name, medical record number or other unique identifiers, patient location)\n   b. Birth date and/or age\n   c. Allergies and associated reactions\n   d. Height and dosing weight in metric units\n   e. Diagnosis/diagnoses\n   f. Indication(s) for PN\n   g. Administration route/vascular access device (peripheral vs central)\n   h. Contact information for prescriber\n\n<a id='eba10ce0-07e1-4932-97d7-765abf916857'></a>\n\nCAPTION ERROR\n\n<a id='e0019c12-8833-4d66-98d3-5e548dc1a988'></a>\n\nCAPTION ERROR\n\n<a id='d1e95593-de6f-4c68-9486-02acbdd4b57d'></a>\n\ni. Date and time order submitted\nj. Administration date and time\nk. Volume and infusion rate\nl. Infusion schedule (continuous or cyclic)\nm. Type of formulation (dextrose/amino acids with separate infusion of IVFE or total nutrient admixture)\nn. All PN ingredients shall be ordered as follows:\n\n   1. Ingredients ordered as amounts per day (for adult patients) or amounts per kilogram per day (for pediatric and neonatal patients) rather than in amounts per liter, percent concentration, or volume.¹ \"Amount per day\" refers to macronutrients in grams per day and micronutrients in mEq, mmol, mcg, or mg per day.\n   2. Electrolytes shall be ordered as the complete salt form rather than the individual ion.\n   3. The PN order should contain the full generic name for each ingredient.¹,¹³ Brand names should only be used when multiple products exist and/or when the brand name may assist in identifying unique properties of the specific dosage form (eg, inherent electrolytes in amino acid formulations, fatty acids in IVFE).¹,¹³\n   4. All abbreviations shall follow The Joint Commission standards on abbreviations.¹³,¹⁴ Abbreviations on the ISMP's list of error-prone abbreviations, symbols, and dose designations shall not be used.¹⁵\no. A dose for each macronutrient\np. A dose for each electrolyte\nq. A dose for vitamins, including multivitamins and/or individual vitamin entities. Multivitamins shall be included daily in PN formulations¹,¹⁶\nr. A dose for trace elements, including multicomponents and/or individual trace element entities\ns. A dose for each non-nutrient medication (eg, insulin)\n\nPN orders shall undergo a clinical review to assess appropriateness and shall include the following elements:\na. Indication is consistent with published guidelines.\nb. Calculated osmolarity of the PN formulation is appropriate for the route of administration/vascular access device (peripheral vs central).¹\nc. Each additive macronutrient, micronutrient, non-nutrient medication (eg, insulin) is evaluated to confirm that the dose is clinically appropriate for the patient's nutrition needs, metabolic status, organ function, allergies, concomitant interventions, and other indices, and to confirm that the\n\n<a id='28672d7a-04a8-4071-8cd4-24fa9b9738d5'></a>\n\ndose is consistent with institutional practice stan-dards.\nd. The formulation is compared with the previous day's PN formulation, if any, to assess for substan-tial additions, deletions, increases, or decreases in dosages of macronutrients, micronutrients, or medications (eg, insulin).\ne. When laboratory data are available, updated lab-oratory values that have been reported since the order was submitted should be reviewed for sig-nificant changes and, if present, the appropriate-ness of additive dosing should be reevaluated.\n6. PN orders shall undergo a formulation safety review that includes the following elements:\na. All ingredients are evaluated for compatibility with each other. Calcium-phosphate precipitation risk should be assessed according to institutional policies and procedures.\nb. PN formulation is evaluated for expected stabil-ity from the time of preparation until the time that administration of the PN is complete. For exam-ple, emulsion stability of a total nutrient admix-ture should be evaluated.\n7. Healthcare organizations shall develop policies and/or protocols to clarify PN orders when doses are outside normal ranges or potential incompatibilities may exist (eg, adjusting calcium and phosphate doses to avoid the risk of calcium-phosphate precipitation, adjusting the IVFE dose when it is not expected to be stable as a TNA [ordering IVFE separately or adjusting IVFE dosage such that the daily dose achieves minimum concentration for stability]).\n8. Modifications to the prescriber's original PN order shall be communicated to the licensed prescriber (or their designee) and documented in the patient's medi-cal record in a manner that is auditable.\n9. All PN orders that require transcription of order data should undergo an independent double-check⁴ process prior to compounding the PN formulation. The double-check shall be documented and auditable.\n10. All PN orders requiring calculations or conversion of units of measure should undergo an independent dou-ble-check⁴ process prior to compounding the PN for-mulation. All double-checks shall be documented and auditable.\n11. Recommendations for pharmacy review of PN orders apply whether the pharmacist reviewing the PN order is on site or at a remote location from the prescriber. The time dedicated for the pharmacist(s) to review PN orders should be based on the average number of PN orders and the estimated time to review, clarify, and/or modify a PN order at an organization.\n\n<a id='c01baaee-813e-4914-ab06-502c0983cefa'></a>\n\n5.\n\n<a id='0c5b9052-b11d-4200-84d7-b3bb64c108a7'></a>\n\nCAPTION ERROR\n\n<a id='0bc1cdb9-36ea-4ca2-832a-eae6687479cc'></a>\n\nCAPTION ERROR\n\n<a id='2ad7b3a1-8c5a-4204-9801-fc76f4cb26b6'></a>\n\n12. PN orders that are completed in a hospital but outsourced to a third-party pharmacy for compounding and PN orders submitted to home infusion pharmacies should undergo the same standardized pharmacy review and verification process prior to transmission to the pharmacy for compounding.\n13. Institutions shall create a home PN order process that provides a safe plan for multiple days of therapy. The prescription for home PN therapy should be written in a format that specifically reflects trends in laboratory values and previous days of PN therapy. An institutional daily PN order format should not be used as a home PN prescription.\n14. Pharmacies have the same responsibility of maintaining the PN orders in their records as with other medication orders.\n15. The healthcare organization shall develop criteria to evaluate and identify pharmacists who are competent to review and verify PN orders.\n    a. Pharmacists responsible for the review and verification of PN orders should have completed specialty residency training and/or be certified as a Board Certified Nutrition Support Pharmacist (BCNSP) by the Board of Pharmacy Specialties (BPS).\n    b. In the absence of pharmacists with specialty residency training or BCNSP certification, the organization should have methods to identify and evaluate pharmacists competent to review and verify PN orders such as the certification program offered by the National Board of Nutrition Support Certification (NBNSC) until such time that a pharmacist with specialty residency training or BCNSP certification is available.\n    c. In the absence of pharmacists with specialty residency training or BCNSP certification, the organization should provide formal training programs or an opportunity to participate in formal training programs to increase knowledge and skills in nutrition support and with a goal of becoming certified in nutrition support. Training should focus on evaluating dosage of macronutrients and micronutrients as well as prescribing non-nutrient medications (eg, insulin) and their compatibilities and stabilities in PN.\n16. Pharmacists who review and verify PN orders should demonstrate competency at least annually.\n17. Quality improvement programs should be in place to report, track, and analyze errors associated with the PN order review and verification process.\n\n<a id='3e4a4e71-2a1b-4f83-a17e-f1dda40001ca'></a>\n\nRationale\nThe review of medication orders, including PN orders, involves many steps in which the pharmacist evaluates the order for\n\n<a id='39459399-23df-43af-90d5-a2a26a5da652'></a>\n\nsafety, efficacy, and appropriateness. These processes require\nknowledge of PN therapy and formulations; critical thinking\nand decision making by the pharmacist is crucial, and appropri-\nate allotment of time is necessary. 2,17 Before any PN formula-\ntion is compounded, the PN order is reviewed and verified.\nStandardizing these processes satisfies that all elements are\nincluded and the order is complete. The review and verification\nof PN orders includes both a clinical review and a pharmaceuti-\ncal review. The verification is conducted to check that the PN\norder is complete and that the appropriate vascular access is in\nplace for new patients beginning PN.2 Additionally, the clinical\nreview evaluates the appropriateness of the dose of each macro-\nnutrient and micronutrient as well as non-nutrient medications\nin the PN formulation. A pharmaceutical review of PN orders is\nalso conducted to determine if the prescribed components are\ncompatible and if the PN formulation is expected to be stable.2\n\n<a id='189501c6-22af-40b9-b663-4534da10bf6b'></a>\n\nA recent survey of PN practices reported that most institu-\ntions (60.2%) dedicate 0.6 full-time equivalent or more phar-\nmacists to verify and review PN orders. However, 23.1% did\nnot have any dedicated pharmacist time for these tasks. When\na pharmacist is involved, most conduct both a clinical and\npharmaceutical review of PN orders. The 2012 survey by the\nAmerican Society of Health-System Pharmacists of pharmacy\npractice in hospitals reports that 11.1% of hospital pharmacies\nhave pharmacists responsible for monitoring patients receiving\nPN therapy. 18\n\n<a id='69bf1bf0-164e-42cb-9116-71037538fff8'></a>\n\nThe complexity of PN orders necessitates special knowl-\nedge and skills to adequately review PN orders. Special train-\ning programs focusing on all aspects of the review process,\nespecially the total daily dose of PN components, will improve\nthe review process and heighten the pharmacist's awareness\nand ability to identify errors. ¹² Identification of errors in turn\nrequires follow-up and/or clarification with the prescriber. In\nthe recent survey of PN practices conducted by Boullata et al,\nthe reasons for PN order clarification included illegible orders,\ndoses outside normal ranges, incompatible additives, and\nincorrect PN volume or infusion rate. ⁸ Errors and patient harm\nhave also occurred when pharmacists misinterpreted informa-\ntion on the PN label when patients transferred from one health-\ncare setting to another (eg, home to hospital).¹ Failure to follow\nand be judicious with the verification and review processes\nhave resulted in adverse events. ¹,³,⁵,¹² Certification in nutrition\nsupport validates an individual's qualifications and level of\nknowledge to practice in this area.¹⁹ BPS criteria for recogni-\ntion states that the area of specialization shall be one for which\nspecifically trained practitioners are needed to fulfill the\nresponsibilities of the pharmacy profession in improving the\nhealth and welfare of the public, which are responsibilities that\nmay not otherwise be fulfilled effectively. Nutrition support\npharmacy practice fulfills that criteria. ¹⁹ In one paper, staff\nobtained certification in nutrition support and targeted indi-\nviduals with specialty certification when recruiting for new\nstaff. This resulted in a substantial increase in knowledge and\nability of pharmacists to manage the associated complexities of\nPN.\n²⁰\n\n<a id='bb352f66-5af9-4fe1-97f6-3ee4cb203846'></a>\n\nAyers et al\n\n<a id='58ff59be-1510-4d6c-ad3a-19d64e6bc6b9'></a>\n\n309\n\n<a id='00643b92-ea69-462e-b967-90c46b0e786a'></a>\n\n(V3) What are the steps healthcare organizations can take to improve the PN label and labeling system?\n\nRecommendations\n\n1.  Healthcare organizations shall have a policy and pro-cedure/protocol for standardized labeling of PN formulations.\n2.  Elements of the PN label include¹: (see Figure 3 and Figure 4)\n    a.  Two patient identifiers (eg, name, medical record number, date of birth)\n    b.  Patient location or address\n    c.  Dosing weight in metric units\n    d.  Administration date and time\n    e.  Beyond-use date and time\n    f.  Route of administration (central vs peripheral vas-cular access)\n    g.  Prescribed volume and overfill volume\n    h.  Infusion rate expressed in mL/h\n    i.  Duration of the infusion (continuous vs cyclic)\n    j.  Size of in-line filter (1.2 or 0.22 micron)\n    k.  Complete name of all ingredients\n    l.  Barcode\n    m.  All ingredients shall be listed in the same sequence and same units of measure as PN order.\n        *   All PN ingredients shall be ordered in amounts per day (for adult patients) or amounts per kilogram per day (for pediatric and neonatal patients) rather than in amounts per liter, per-cent concentration, or volume. \"Amount per day\" refers to macronutrients in grams per day and micronutrients in mEq, mmol, mcg, or mg per day.\n        *   Electrolytes shall be ordered as the complete salt form rather than the individual ion. Each individual macronutrient and micronutrient ordered shall be listed with its corresponding dose.\n        *   For home or alternative site PN labels, a list of patient/caregiver additives shall be included; these additives shall be easily identified and differentiated from the other PN components. Techniques to identify patient additives include highlighting or an asterisk to identify the addi-tives that are added just prior to administration.\n3.  Name of institution or pharmacy\n4.  Institution or pharmacy contact information, including\n\n<a id='0503113a-1963-49af-8efe-1a57fd0e7264'></a>\n\n5. Auxiliary labels may be used to express individual electrolytes as mEq and the phosphorus content as mmol per day. The label may also include information on the amount of energy provided by each macronutrient or electrolytes intrinsic to the amino acids product.\n6. If IVFEs are infused separately (vs TNA), the essential elements of the IVFE label are: (see Figure 5 and Figure 6)\n   a. Two patient identifiers (name, medical record number, date of birth)\n   b. Patient location or address\n   c. Dosing weight\n   d. Administration date and time\n   e. Route of administration (central vs peripheral access)\n   f. Prescribed amount of IVFE and volume required to deliver that amount\n   g. Infusion rate expressed in mL/h\n   h. Duration of the infusion (not longer than 12 hours)\n   i. Complete name of the IVFE, even though label placed on original manufacturer container\n   j. Beyond-use date and time\n   k. Name of institution or pharmacy\n   l. Institution or pharmacy telephone number\n7. Labels for home PN formulations should be consistent with USP General Chapter <17>.21 (See Figure 7)\n   a. Organize the prescription label in a patient-centered manner.\n     * Organized in a manner that best reflects how most patients seek out and understand medical information\n     * Includes only the most important patient information needed for safe and effective understanding\n   b. Emphasize instructions and other information important to the patient.\n     * Prominently display information that is critical for patient's safe and effective use of therapy\n     * At the top of the label, specify the patient's name, drug name (spelling out full generic and brand name), and strength/dose. Include explicitly clear directions for use in simple language\n     * Directions should follow a standard format so the patient can expect that each element will be in the same regimented order each time the medication is received\n   c. Simplify language\n     * Language on the label should be clear, simplified, concise, and familiar, and should be used in a standardized manner. Only common terms and sentences should be used.\n\n<a id='d7ec8588-d311-4960-a2e9-84700b07c84c'></a>\n\n*Question: Verification 3 (V3)*\n\n<a id='b6464c9c-a53f-4af3-b45d-3af707244268'></a>\n\ntelephone number\n\n<a id='7b832308-9d61-41e0-85f9-7446588bc172'></a>\n\nCAPTION ERROR\n\n<a id='4d35d23e-35ac-4eae-90c1-4223369fe9c7'></a>\n\nCAPTION ERROR\n\n<a id='2ccaaeed-96d8-487d-b29a-ceb8b8cfcacf'></a>\n\n* Use simplified, standardized sentences that have been developed to promote ease of understanding the instructions correctly.\nd.

The pharmacy-generated label is a critical tool used to compare the PN ingredients and administration information against the PN order. Standardized pharmacy labels for PN formulations provide information in a clear, uniform, and organized manner, and improves the verification processes for pharmacists.¹ Additionally, the label serves as a final check for those administering the PN, including nurses or patients/caregivers.¹²,¹³ Listing ingredients in a uniform sequence and units of measure removes the need for calculations and reduces the risk of misinterpretation. The misinterpretation of a PN label resulted in a child receiving an overdose of iron dextran and experiencing subsequent liver toxicity from iron overload.²² The lack of standardization has created confusion, especially when patients are transferred from one healthcare environment to another.²³\n\n<a id='4cc91fc2-e783-4159-9da1-3263aa9bd14d'></a>\n\nQuestion: Verification 4 (V4)\n\n(V4) What processes can healthcare organizations implement to improve the safety of PN therapy during shortages of PN components?\n\n<a id='04ccbfd0-6400-4353-b56f-ce369299f862'></a>\n\n_Recommendations_\n\n1.

More than 1800 healthcare professionals responded and reported 1000 medication errors or adverse patient events due to a drug shortage. Of those who responded, 35% reported their institution had experienced a near miss during the past year due to a drug shortage; 25% reported an actual error, and 20% reported an adverse patient outcome.31 Another drug shortage survey was conducted by Premier Healthcare Alliance. Over 300 pharmacy experts from hospitals and other healthcare sites participated. Shortages that may have resulted in a medication safety issue or error in patient care were reported as having been experienced by 89% of respondents.32\n\n<a id='a8383b59-05de-4b5c-93fd-cb4f83aff85f'></a>\n\nTo understand the impact of PN product shortages on patient\nsafety, each step of the PN process should be considered. The\nsteps of the PN process include procurement, management,\nprescribing, order review, compounding and dispensing,\n\n<a id='e58f9636-947e-4fc1-959f-f575e18ee853'></a>\n\nAyers et al\n\n<a id='cedf0a4a-3036-48df-b7f4-2d61934b1162'></a>\n\nCAPTION ERROR\n\n<a id='40d53d1e-4998-43d2-b2b1-d8a28ce43f0c'></a>\n\nPatient Name: ___\nPatient Home Address: ___\nBirthdate/Age: ___\nHeight and dosing weight: Ht: ___ cm Dosing Wt: ___ kg\nVascular access device/location CVC type: ___ Location ___\n\nAdministration Date/Time/Indication\nInfuse 1 bag each day for nutrition.\nInfuse at ___ mL per hour over ___ hours\nStart at ___ (time)\nStop at ___ (time)\n\nMacronutrients\nAmount/day\nAmino acidsᵃ: ___ g\nDextrose: ___ g\nIV fat emulsionᵃ: ___ g\n\nElectrolytes\nSodium phosphate: ___ mmol of phosphate (Sodium ___ mEq)\nSodium chloride: ___ mEq\nSodium acetate: ___ mEq\nPotassium phosphate: ___ mmol of phosphate (Potassium ___ mEq)\nPotassium chloride: ___ mEq\nPotassium acetate: ___ mEq\nMagnesium sulfate/chloride: ___ mEq\nCalcium gluconate: ___ mEq\n\nVitamins, trace elements\nMulti-component Trace Elements: ___ mL\n\nAdd prior to administration\nMulti-component vitaminsᵃ: ___ mL to be added immediately prior to administration\n\nOther Additives\nInsulin: ___ Units to be added immediately prior to administration\nMedications: ___ Medication specific units (mcg, mg, g)\nSpecify if requires adding immediately prior to administration.\n\nTotal Volume: ___ mL Overfill volume: ___ mL\nDo not use after: Date ___ Time ___\n\nPrescriber's name/phone number: ___\n\nInstitution/Pharmacy Name: ___\nInstitution/Pharmacy Address: ___\nPharmacy Phone Number: ___\n\n<a id='b4caa718-addd-4ea1-b279-85e71df3178d'></a>\n\nFigure 7.

In a recent\nsurvey, 16.4% of respondents reported that patient outcome was\ndirectly affected by PN-related product shortages, including\nnutrient deficits, increased length of stay, and increased morbid-\nity and mortality.⁸ Managing PN product shortages includes\nactivities such as developing and revising policies and\n\n<a id='6b147ce3-382d-4589-ac56-32b2437ae51a'></a>\n\nprocedures for rationing or restricting PN products, use of alter-\nnative products, prescribing systems, and changes in compound-\ning and dispensing as the result of shortages.\n\n<a id='9a97499c-779a-4afb-8668-1f4f21a486be'></a>\n\nPN product shortages may be so critical that prescribers may elect not to provide PN therapy because there are no prod-ucts to prevent or treat complications.

The prescribing step is affected as prescribers find\nit difficult to keep up with shortages, alternative products,\nrationing, restrictions, and so on. Furthermore, the prescribing\nprocess is constantly changing, and prescribers may use work-\narounds to circumvent safety checks. Lastly, an increase in the\nnumber of prescribing errors has been associated with\nshortages. 30,31\n\n<a id='ea0fc6c0-f0d2-498a-a733-6be49e69c515'></a>\n\nMany of the same safety concerns have been identified in the PN order review step. Pharmacists who perform this step have difficulty staying current with shortages, alternative prod-ucts, and rationing. There has been an increase in the number of PN orders that require clarification or those with prescribing errors.\n\n<a id='6345b193-ea92-4253-971d-114a501cbefe'></a>\n\nThe compounding and dispensing steps are associated with\nnumerous patient safety issues resulting from PN product\nshortages. As with other aspects of the PN process, those\nresponsible for compounding and dispensing find it difficult\nand stressful trying to keep up with the many shortages. During\na shortage, alternative products that are unfamiliar or are simi-\nlar in appearance to other products may be substituted. This\nmay lead to errors. Furthermore, PN may be compounded\nusing alternative products such as calcium chloride or magne-\nsium chloride, for which there are insufficient stability and\ncompatibility data or known unfavorable differences. Frequent\nchanges in PN products or the size of the source containers\nnecessitate a change in the configuration of ACD, increasing\nthe potential for error. Some products cannot be configured for\nthe ACD, requiring a manual addition to a PN formulation.\nFrequent changes in products, alternative products, ordering\nprocess, and ACD configuration may result in PN orders and\nPN bag labels that do not match. This creates significant con-\ncerns for those responsible for the administration of the PN\nadmixture.\n\n<a id='c3ff924f-4c8e-457e-92c4-bd85fd0b0449'></a>\n\nThe PN product shortages affect the administration of PN whether administered by a nurse, patient, or caregiver. Just like others involved in the PN process, it is difficult and stressful to keep current with the shortages. As noted above, the PN order and PN bag labels may not match as the result of changes in the compounding process. With some shortages, patients may require supplemental electrolyte or mineral infusions when the alternative product cannot be added to the PN formulation due to stability or compatibility concerns. Increasing the number of times the patient's intravascular device is accessed may increase the risk of catheter-related bloodstream infections.<sup>30</sup> A recent study of PN practices reported the consequences of PN product shortages. Of the pharmacists responding, more than two-thirds reported that valuable time is consumed in developing contingencies. Additionally, 70.3% of respondents indicated that shortages interfere with the ability to meet patients' micronutrient needs, and almost half reported that shortages interfere with ability to meet macronutrient needs.<sup>8</sup>\n\n<a id='5f0c9500-536e-4bd2-bda6-2d1972a1ca50'></a>\n\nThe lack of a PN component increases the risk of a defi-\nciency of that nutrient or complications. Shortages have been\nassociated with patient harm. Anemia and leukopenia due to\ncopper deficiency has been reported in an adult patient receiv-\ning PN without trace elements for 4 months. 33 Clinicians must\nhave a heightened awareness of potential deficiencies and\nmonitor for the deficiencies or associated complications.\n\n<a id='6f1faaa0-5223-44e7-8b14-9207f790b54e'></a>\n\nThe shortages pose safety risks throughout the entire PN\nprocess, from procurement to patient outcomes. Providing PN\ntherapy during product shortages requires vigilance and con-\ntinuous assessment of the entire PN process to optimize patient\ncare quality and avoid patient harm.\n\n<a id='4d8d233b-ac71-4cc9-a518-daa148d3de67'></a>\n\n*Topics for Future Research*\n1.

Additionally, a lack of competency-based educational curriculum in schools of pharmacy or pharmacy technician training programs may contribute to PN errors. Very few suitable studies exist that characterize the formalized training of pharmacy students or technicians in the preparation of sterile products and admixtures. Available data suggest that when pharmacy students are formally taught aseptic technique skills with direct observation and assessment of parenteral compounding procedures, microbial contamination rates related to medium-risk level compounding (eg, PN compounding) decreased significantly from baseline toward the end of the 16-week course.¹ Several recommendations pertaining to the knowledge and competency of staff involved in the preparation of compounded sterile products were developed at the recent ISMP Sterile Preparation Compounding Safety Summit.² Surveys of pharmacists at the beginning of postgraduate training programs demonstrated that first-year pharmacy residents reported minimal experience (median = 2) on a scale from 1 to 5 (5, most experience and 1, no experience) with PN evaluations and IV admixtures. This suggests that there are educational deficits in current pharmacist training related to areas important for institutional or homecare pharmacy practice.³ Observational data from practicing hospital pharmacists and pharmacy technicians revealed that compounding error rates were 37% when PN formulations were manually compounded and 22% when prepared with an ACD. Errors included touch contamination, incorrect calculations performed by technicians, and bypassing the built-in safety check systems on ACDs.⁴\n\n<a id='b8264a83-a5ad-4f9c-ba98-6962a7a9de6a'></a>\n\nQuestion: Compounding 1–2 (C1–C2)\n\n(C1) What compounding errors have been caused by deficits in knowledge, lack of training, competency, and proficiency?\n(C2) What compounding errors have been caused by a lack of standardized educational curriculum in schools of pharmacy or pharmacy technician programs?\n\n<a id='f5ea1398-9326-4459-8a83-4a0a8b10f7d7'></a>\n\n## Recommendations\n\n1. Schools of pharmacy in the United States shall develop curricula that address proper aseptic technique and USP Chapter <797> for making compounded sterile preparations (CSPs).\n2. Pharmacy technicians shall be certified by the Pharmacy Technician Certification Board if they are involved in the making of CSPs, including PN.\n3. Healthcare organizations shall provide a broad orienta- tion with an in-depth training program focusing on CSPs for all staff members supervising or participating in the\n\n<a id='41a3b32f-a1b6-410f-99e5-8b8aaefbb8b7'></a>\n\npreparation process. An ongoing competency assessment program shall be included in the training as well.\n\n4. Healthcare organizations shall require annual competency evaluations of pharmacists and pharmacy technicians involved in preparation of CSPs. This should include:\n   a. Calculations\n   b. Compounding base solutions\n   c. Preparing dilutions or aliquots\n   d. Aseptic technique manipulations\n   e. Using technology (ie, ACD) for preparation\n   f. Anticipating incompatibilities (calcium, phosphate)\n5. Organizations should develop a strategic plan for implementation of automation and technology for the sterile products service.\n6. Pharmacists and pharmacy technicians shall be proficient in the proper use of technology (ie, ACD) when used for preparation of CSPs.\n7. State Boards of Pharmacy should create a specific license and licensing requirements for infusion pharmacies and compounding pharmacies.\n8. State Boards of Pharmacy should provide an in-depth training program focusing on CSPs for all State Board inspectors. An ongoing competency assessment program should be included in the training as well.\n\n<a id='5fa0032b-9f23-4bda-ac05-0b92d92e725b'></a>\n\n# Rationale\nThe lack of standardized training emphasizing foundational concepts behind sterile compounding and aseptic technique is startling in today's professional programs educating both pharmacists and pharmacy technicians. Over the past 5 years, numerous reports of serious morbidity and mortality have appeared in the lay press due to a lack of training in aseptic technique with preparation of sterile products. The most recent tragic events have surrounded a rare outbreak of fungal meningitis that was traced to several lots of the injectable glucocorticoid methylprednisolone acetate compounded by the New England Compounding Center. Although these sterile injections were intended for back and joint pain, a lack of sterile compounding competency has sickened hundreds of patients and killed dozens. Even more relevant are the 9 deaths that occurred in Alabama during the preparation of amino acids under high-risk conditions and an error in sterile compounding technique. It is incumbent on pharmacists to check that all people involved in the oversight and preparation of CSPs obtain appropriate training and be evaluated on a regular basis through a competency assessment. Pharmacists would receive education in the physicochemical principles of pharmacy and practice experiences as part of a pharmacy school curriculum. Technicians would receive education in the operations of ACD hardware and software with varied practice experiences as part of the curriculum. Board certification for those involved in CSPs could guarantee a basic minimum requirement in lieu of\n\n<a id='6550dfe2-6d58-48f2-aeb6-cc72c74bc8ba'></a>\n\nCAPTION ERROR\n\n<a id='e8c53a59-4479-45f0-8bd8-6e165e30397a'></a>\n\n319\n\n<a id='b03a2cf9-a8f0-432a-9321-e23ca3b459b6'></a>\n\nformalized training as part of a curriculum. The criteria\nrequired for nutrition support pharmacy board certification\nwould suggest that these individuals are better prepared to\nallow fewer errors, although no data are available to support\nthis contention. Anecdotal data would suggest that pharmacists\nand pharmacy technicians with specific education and many\nhours of hands-on experience are in the best position to be\ninvolved with PN compounding. In the workplace, pharma-\ncists and technicians should participate in a comprehensive\norientation and training program with an ongoing competency\nassessment plan.² This plan would evaluate all aspects of ster-\nile compounding from calculations to the proper use of\ntechnology.\n\n<a id='9b522792-df5d-4ba5-b799-a565e9b5f4e7'></a>\n\nQuestion: Compounding 3 (C3)\n\n(C3) How can organizations avoid PN errors by implementing soft and hard limits on an ACD?\n\n<a id='7291804c-0fa1-4c88-8896-d5dc6553bf00'></a>\n\n## Recommendations\n\n1. Organizations shall implement specific computerized soft limits and hard (catastrophic) limits for PN ingredients based upon pharmacists' review that are consistent with the needs of their patient population.\n2. Access to the ACD database is limited to select individuals qualified to manage and maintain this activity and all changes are traceable. Pharmacists and technicians shall be educated on interpretation and limitations of calcium-phosphate compatibility curves in the software.\n3. Weight-based warning limits for doses shall be developed by clinicians with the assistance of the vendors. As an alternative, organizations may develop and use their own weight-based warning limits.\n4. Only pharmacists shall be allowed to override alerts. An independent double-check process should be completed by another pharmacy staff member, ideally another pharmacist.²\n5. Healthcare organizations should check that all unresolved ACD alerts encountered during the PN order entry process should be presented to the person reviewing the order entry so they can also view and respond to the alerts.\n6. Healthcare organizations shall reinforce the importance of reacting to the ACD alerts and documenting all interventions.\n7. Healthcare organizations should review available reports detailing the frequency of overrides as well as the frequency of overrides for specific PN components.\n\n<a id='b114888f-a9dd-4aff-9c69-c02fb24541e3'></a>\n\n*Rationale*\nLimits can be placed on the doses of each PN component to optimize safety within the compounding process. These limits\n\n<a id='2f1b27ef-862b-46f5-a0e4-2f54edc1fbbb'></a>\n\ncan be automated within the PN order-prescribing, reviewing,\nand/or compounding process. The term \"hard limits\" refers to\nalerts that indicate that a component is outside a determined\nsafe range and shall not be exceeded; these are also referred to\nas \"catastrophic\" given patient outcomes if exceeded.² \"Soft\nlimits\" refer to alerts that indicate an unusual dose that requires\nfurther evaluation. Once addressed, any alert that is overridden\nor any dosing that is revised will require documentation of the\nrationale. Compared with manual methods, the software appli-\ncation available with ACDs should lead to improved com-\npounding accuracy, enforcement of proper compounding\nsequence, and a reduction in opportunities for human touch\ncontamination. However, preparing PN admixtures with an\nACD is not an error-free process. Error rates in compounding\ncomplex preparations such as PN admixtures have been\nreported to be 22% when automated in part and 37% when\nmanually prepared.⁶ Organizations may improve the safety of\nusing PN compounding systems by requiring that all doses\nbeing compounded pass through an order entry/clinical deci-\nsion support system and by ensuring that those systems' clini-\ncal decision support features are properly enabled and\nconfigured. Transcription of PN order data from an order-cal-\nculating software package into a compounding device should\nbe avoided. In a recent survey on PN use, Boullata et al found\nthat dose limit warnings were active in only two-thirds of orga-\nnizations that used ACDs for preparing PN formulations.⁷\nISMP Medication Safety Alerts from 2007 and 2011 described\nincidents in which adverse outcomes resulted, in part, from the\nabsence of dose limit warnings.⁸,⁹ In both instances, infants\nreceived lethal doses of a micronutrient (zinc in one case,\nsodium in the other) when a manual order entry error was\neither not detected by the existing dose limits or dose limit\nalerts were not active. After reviewing the incidents, ISMP\nmade a number of safe practice recommendations. Among\nthese was the recommendation to install, test, and maximize\nautomated dose-limit warnings in the pharmacy computer sys-\ntem and the ACD order entry system, particularly for high-alert\nmedications such as PN and its ingredients. Further, ISMP rec-\nommends that each organization develop weight-based dosing\nlimits applicable to their patient populations, as ACD vendor-\nestablished \"catastrophic\" limits may still allow entry of a\npotentially fatal dose into the software without issuing a\nwarning.⁸,⁹\n\n<a id='ea215ea9-f57d-441c-8c28-df049b0ee758'></a>\n\nThe ASHP guidelines on the safe use of ACDs for the prep-aration of PN admixtures state that the pharmacy department should develop a monitoring and surveillance plan that pro-motes safe and efficacious use of the device at all times. 10 This plan should include a review of dose-limit alerts and overrides, utilizing the reporting capabilities of the ACD or pharmacy computer system.\n\n<a id='c980eeb8-3134-45c0-b84a-c79e9f508758'></a>\n\nDeBoer and Maddox described a review of smart pump data\nafter implementation throughout the Sanford USD Medical\nCenter.\" Three to six months of smart pump data were col-\nlected for each unit and an analysis of edit variance detail and\noverride variance detail was performed. After the initial review\n\n<a id='6505263f-63c3-4d14-bd30-f3770bd70527'></a>\n\nCAPTION ERROR\n\n<a id='32e3df0a-db07-4a08-89e2-e22eb58f6f26'></a>\n\nJournal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition 38(3)\n\n<a id='1bfbb9e4-37e2-4628-91c8-df52e3c383d3'></a>\n\nwas completed, data were analyzed for medications included\nin the ISMP high-alert medication list. Work practices were\nevaluated and revised with the goal of encouraging fewer edits\nand overrides. In a similar fashion, data from the ACD or phar-\nmacy computer system should be regularly reviewed in the\nassessment of trends and other long-term measures of\nperformance.\n\n<a id='ccbf2b09-d136-4c20-88dd-34448f56e35e'></a>\n\nQuestion: Compounding 4 (C4)\n\n(C4) What role does United States Pharmacopeia (USP)\nChapter <797> play in preventing PN errors?\n\n<a id='07b34551-2949-4231-a461-7ceb2674ca6d'></a>\n\nRecommendations\n\n1. Healthcare organizations shall comply with USP Chapter <797> standards.<sup>12</sup>\n2. Outsourcing should be considered as an alternative to in-house compounding when the healthcare organization does not possess the technological resources or staffing to prepare PN admixtures according to USP Chapter <797>. The decision to outsource should require that the pharmacy outsourcing PN production exercise due diligence to monitor that the outsourcer also operates within USP <797> guidelines.\n3. Standardized, commercially available PN products may be viable options to manually compounded sterile PN products when compliance with USP Chapter <797> and accepted guidelines from patient safety organizations is not feasible.\n4. Healthcare organizations shall have policies and procedures that address using multichamber, standardized, commercial PN products within their formulary.\n5. Healthcare organizations shall have well-defined policies and procedures that guide the preparation of PN admixtures.\n6. Healthcare organizations must identify standardized workflow processes that include quality control, process change control, and documentation practices. These standardized operating procedures should encompass the entire compounding process from order entry to verification of the final labeled product.\n7. Healthcare organizations should develop a strategic plan to include technology/automation for sterile compounding and consider using IV workflow software.<sup>2</sup>\n8. When an ACD is used to prepare PN admixtures, policies and procedures shall be developed that address performance requirements and responsibilities, control of the ACD in daily operations, safety and efficacy features, quality assurance monitoring and documentation, storage and inventory, education and training, and device variability and maintenance.\n9. Privileges to make changes in the ACD database shall be restricted to a limited number of pharmacy staff who are well trained in both the theory and the mechanics of this process.<sup>2</sup>\n\n<a id='ee595eeb-c4bb-4c3f-8cd8-0e351f747126'></a>\n\n10. Customized order entry templates created by organiza-tions should have a documented standard review pro-cess by qualified staff person that includes review and testing of the clinical decision support that is expected to alert the pharmacist to significant warnings. The use of a checklist or sign-off sheet shall be required and two staff members, including at least one pharmacist, shall sign off on or validate the template.²\n11. The additive sequence in compounding shall be opti-mized and validated as a safe and efficacious method. Manufacturers of ACDs shall provide an additive sequence that promotes the safety of the compounding device. This compounding sequence should be reviewed with the manufacturer of the PN products used by the organization.¹³\n12. The use of a checklist or signoff sheet shall be required when adding new products, including new and alterna-tive generics, changes in vial size or concentration, and when making other modifications to the ACD database (eg, changes in privileges, changes in data require-ments). Two staff members shall be required to sign off on or validate changes. (This process would not apply to inputting a new lot number for a product already in the database.)²\n13. Barcode verification shall be used to verify product identity during ACD setup and replacement of ingredients.²\n14. An independent double-check process for the initial daily ACD setup shall be performed by two staff mem-bers using a printed checklist. Verbal affirmation should take place to validate placement of all additives and base solutions, including name, concentration, and container size.² When the vendor of the compounding system describes a validated system for proper setup, that system should be followed.\n15. Tubing set(s) shall be traced from the source container to the port where it is attached during the initial daily ACD setup and with each change in the source container.²\n16. If multiple containers of a single additive are used dur-ing the preparation of a single CSP, all empty contain-ers shall be presented to the pharmacist and verified as part of the final check process prior to dispensing the final CSP.²\n17. When an ACD is used, it should deliver all ingredients. Manual compounding should only be used:\na. If the volume of a PN component to be mixed is less than the ACD can accurately deliver.\nb. If there is an interaction between a PN component and a component of the ACD (eg, insulin and tub-ing).\nc. If there is a chemical interaction between PN components that cannot be mitigated by sequenc-ing the addition of ingredients.\nd. During a shortage of a specific PN component, manual compounding can be a consideration as part of conservation efforts.\n\n<a id='5cb5a442-f846-4bb4-8e41-0a0c911ea2a7'></a>\n\nCAPTION ERROR\n\n<a id='31471719-1d1b-418e-bee7-9df10d4ebbf6'></a>\n\n321\n\n<a id='2b99dfa2-3397-484c-b783-e82c68c4f609'></a>\n\n18. Verification of manual additives should include inspection of the actual vials and syringes that contain the additives. Proxy methods of verification (eg, syringe pullback) shall not be used.²\n19. If the manual method is being used, the process should be standardized to promote safety and efficacy.¹³ The use of a checklist or sign-off sheet shall be incorporated into the manual process.\n20. PN orders should be prescribed, transmitted, and compounded when supported by properly trained personnel who regularly perform this task.⁹ This is usually during the daytime hours.\n21. In facilities that care for adult, pediatric, and neonatal patients, the preparation of CSPs for each population shall be separated by time or location. Separation strategies can include the use of different colored bins for assembling products to be prepared.²\n22. At least three verification processes should occur in the pharmacy: (1) after initial order entry of PN, (2) before manually injecting additives into the PN, and (3) once the PN has been compounded.⁹ In-process or end-product testing requires that the PN preparation be held pending results. It may be better to fully automate and validate the entire PN compounding process to prevent errors from being made in the first place.\n23. Organizations should develop a drug conservation policy that addresses the handling and disposition of PN components (while maintaining their integrity and sterility) that may be in short supply due to market conditions, as these shortages can affect workflow conditions.\n24. The physical environment in which PN compounding takes place should be assessed in terms of lighting, interruptions and distractions, sound and noise, ergonomics, and medication safety zone. USP General Chapter <1066> describes optimal physical environment standards that promote safe medication use throughout the medication-use process.¹⁴ Any deficiencies should be addressed following organizational chain of command.\n25. Once a standardized process for compounding PN has been implemented, organizations should review and revise the process on an annual basis along with a review of personnel compounding behavior.\n26. Operation of the compounding process must be routinely observed for procedural compliance and corrective action must be taken immediately if noncompliance is observed.\n\n<a id='0ec1be9c-e4ee-4dce-91a7-e17a6d0194e6'></a>\n\nRationale\n\nAn ASHP national survey of pharmacy practice in hospital set-\ntings published in 2012 found that overall, 65% of hospital\n\n<a id='cf1cc040-bbfd-4f69-9ce8-1d17ec0e135a'></a>\n\npharmacy departments reported having a United States Pharmacopeia (USP) Chapter <797> compliant cleanroom. 15 Having a USP Chapter <797> compliant cleanroom differed significantly by hospital size, with more than 87.5% of the largest hospitals (600 or more staffed beds) having a compliant cleanroom, compared with 48.1% of hospital pharmacy departments in hospitals with fewer than 50 beds. Commercially available PN multichamber bags were used by 36% of hospitals as the predominant form of PN formulation. ACDs were used by 20.4% of hospitals, followed by gravity methods (17.4%) and outsourcing compounding activities (14.6%); 11.6% of hospitals did not prepare PN formulations. The method of preparing PN differed significantly by hospital size. Larger hospitals most commonly used ACDs or outsourced preparations. Hospitals with fewer than 50 staffed beds most commonly used commercially available dextrose/amino acid formulations or TNA did not prepare any PN admixtures or used gravity methods to prepare PN. 15\n\n<a id='12288811-2c9e-477a-9c33-efc57e1ba495'></a>\n\nOrganizations should refer to a number of available guide-lines and articles regarding standardization of the PN com-pounding process (see Table 2). Organizations compounding PN admixtures must have well-defined policies and procedures to guide each step of preparation and shall comply with stan-dards set forth in USP Chapter <797>.² Compounding PN \"as usual\" is no longer acceptable if it does not comply fully with USP Chapter <797>.¹⁸ Error rates in compounding complex preparations such as PN admixtures have been reported to be 22% when automated in part and 37% when manually pre-pared.⁶ Error rates of 24% in PN preparation were identified in a prospective observational study.¹⁹ Compounding errors that result in an unexpected patient event occur in 30% of hospi-tals.⁶ The USP chapter that describes the compounding of ster-ile preparations provides minimum practice and quality standards based on current scientific information and best ster-ile compounding practices.¹² Organizations that are unable to comply with USP Chapter <797> and accepted guidelines from patient safety organizations should consider alternative compounding options such as outsourcing or standardized commercially available PN products.\n\n<a id='aa20166f-d164-4be9-b44e-f70fb2146333'></a>\n\nPolicies that require prescribers to order PN daily before a specified deadline should be established and enforced to maximize the safety with which these admixtures are prepared and dispensed. Pharmacy staff should be aware of all patients who are receiving PN and check if orders have not been received by the established deadline. PN ingredients considered to be very small volumes that staff manually prepare, check, and inject require verification, including inspection of the vials and syringes containing such additives. Verification of manual additives should include inspection of the actual vials and syringes that contain the additives. Proxy methods of verification such as the syringe pull-back method of verification should not be used in the preparation of PN and other high-alert CSPs and shall not be used without the presence of the actual original source containers (medication and diluent).²\n\n<a id='599a7047-fb50-49da-8a17-bfda2f943a2b'></a>\n\nCAPTION ERROR\n\n<a id='cf147b2b-0c1c-4123-8049-8565f245385a'></a>\n\nJournal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition 38(3)\n\n<a id='7af8acec-d004-4679-97ee-42665a98a113'></a>\n\nTable 2.

At least three verification processes should occur in the pharmacy: (1) after initial order entry of PN, (2) before manually injecting additives into the PN, and (3) once the PN has been compounded. Each step in the verification process should require a pharmacist to compare the actual prescriber's order to the printed labels, and the printed labels to the additives and final product, as appropriate. Verification of manual additives should include inspection of the actual vials and syringes that contain the additives. The final verification of the compounded PN should include a comprehensive review of the PN order, the label on the product and the compounding work label, and a visual inspection of the CSP. Quality control checks and verification of replacement components on the compounder either manually or via barcoding should also be required, as should an independent double-check of any calculations.\n\n9\n\n<a id='fa5f49a8-1555-4be3-b45b-1faec189f702'></a>\n\nPN multichamber bags, which are designed to reduce the risk for instability or precipitation, are available. These multi-chamber bags separate components of the PN formulation with a bar or seal until just prior to activation and administration. The contents of the chambers should be mixed and any additives introduced by pharmacy staff prior to dispensing the formulation. However, if these products are used in home care, patients and/or caregivers shall be provided with thorough training regarding the procedure for properly mixing the product before use. In addition, the containers should be accompanied by auxiliary labels alerting users to the need to mix the product prior to administration.\n\n<a id='a435920d-8fec-42c2-b20d-b116e2e0010f'></a>\n\nOrganizations should review and revise the PN compounding process on an annual basis. A number of analytical methods have been applied to another high-risk complex compounding process, such as the preparation of chemotherapy. Bonan et al describe a multidisciplinary team's application of the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points method to preparation of anticancer drugs. 20 The team identified 11 critical points. Monitoring, control measures, and corrective actions were identified for each risk. Over a 10-month period, 16,647 chemotherapy preparations were compounded with 1157 nonconformities for the 11 critical control points. These included 693 compounding sheet errors and 131 analytical nonconformities. Aboumatar et al reported the outcomes of application of Lean Sigma solutions to the chemotherapy preparation process. 21 Once mistake-proofing interventions were introduced via workspace redesign, process redesign, and developing standard operating procedures for pharmacy staff, reported medication errors reaching patients causing an increase in patient monitoring decreased and the number of reported near misses increased. These improvements would be welcomed in the PN use process.\n\n<a id='94c3d9ad-7194-457e-8684-95a64edf17b2'></a>\n\n*Topics for Further Research*\n1.

In addition, the broad range of healthcare settings in which PN administration takes place—from critical care to home care—raises the potential for disparities to exist in the technology, equipment, and knowledge and skills of the nursing staff and caregivers responsible for PN administration. Although once uncommon, PN is administered with increasing frequency in long-term care and skilled nursing facilities. Regardless of the setting or the number of patients receiving the therapy in a given facility, the classification of PN as a high-alert medication requires healthcare organizations to develop evidence-based policies and procedures designed to promote safe PN administration and to validate the competence of those responsible for delivering this complex form of IV therapy.\n\n<a id='c6399134-d149-47ec-afce-b46df3ef5d74'></a>\n\nQuestion: Administration 1 (A1)\n\n(A1) What system-based measures can organizations implement to enhance the safety of PN administration?\n\n<a id='8e0c916a-9127-4a6d-94a6-4850764ac04e'></a>\n\n*Recommendations*\n\n1. Written policies and procedures shall be developed to standardize nursing practices for the administration of PN throughout the organization.\n2.

Healthcare organizations that provide nursing services related to home infusion shall establish mechanisms for periodic reassessment of knowledge and techniques used by patient or caregivers for home PN.\n5. Interdisciplinary quality improvement programs shall incorporate analysis of medication errors associated with PN administration and knowledge of errors that occur in other institutions.\n6. Safeguards shall be implemented to address specific problem areas as indicated by analysis of PN administration errors.\n7. An interdisciplinary process should be employed for selecting and evaluating equipment and technological aids, such as smart pumps and barcoding to reduce errors in PN administration.\n8. Healthcare organizations shall develop policies and procedures that address extravasation of PN formulations.\n9. Acute care facilities should establish a policy that prohibits the use of a PN formulation prepared for administration at home or in subacute or long-term care facilities.\n10. Protocols for safe operation of infusion pumps shall stipulate rules regarding alarm silencing, modification, and disabling.\n11. Healthcare organizations should purchase infusion pumps with capacity to reduce errors due to incorrect programming. Whenever possible, infusion pumps should be standardized throughout the organization.\n\n<a id='8369f774-f774-4700-82a1-d81404482789'></a>\n\nRationale\n\nData pertaining to the incidence of errors related to PN admin-\nistration are scarce. A recent survey revealed that 44% of orga-\nnizations do not track PN-related medication errors and do not\nknow where in the process errors may be occurring.¹ The lit-\nerature does provide some insight into the scope of the prob-\nlem. In particular, the frequency with which case reports of\nPN-related errors involve neonatal and pediatric patients sug-\ngests that this population may be most vulnerable to PN admin-\nistration errors.²\n\n<a id='2e8e0168-0c0c-4a09-b961-e45d137b32d8'></a>\n\nOne prospective observational study of errors associated with PN found that 35% of PN-related errors occurred during the administration process.³ In a similar audit of 18,588 PN days in a tertiary pediatric hospital, administration-related errors accounted for 30% of all PN errors.⁴ In addition, data gathered over a 5-year period from a national medication error-reporting program revealed 266 errors associated with IVFE in neonatal intensive care units, 93.2% of which occurred in the administration phase.⁵,⁶ Another report of quality improvement data from a single 39-bed unit caring for neonates to young adults indicated that in one 6-month period, PN and IVFE errors accounted for 25% of all medication errors.⁷\n\n<a id='892925db-59b0-460d-bb0d-046a539ae20d'></a>\n\nStandardized Procedures and Competency Validation. Failure to follow established procedures plays a prominent role in PN administration errors. While human factors frequently contribute to PN errors, organizational efforts to strengthen the safety of PN administration must extend beyond a focus on individual performance and center on identifying system-based approaches to reduce errors.8,9 Fundamental to this process is the development and articulation of nursing policies and procedures for PN administration that standardize nursing practices based on published clinical guidelines.2,5,10 These policies and procedures shall be reviewed and revised on a regular basis. Table 3 provides an outline of essential components of nursing procedures for safe PN administration.\n\n<a id='93623948-102d-4b31-877d-76d86fce27dd'></a>\n\nHealthcare organizations, regardless of setting (acute care\nto home care), shall conduct ongoing education of nurses and\npatients or caregivers and establish mechanisms to validate\ncompetence in PN administration. At a minimum, competency\nvalidation should occur in the following circumstances: as part\nof orientation for newly hired nurses, when a change in proto-\ncol or procedure takes place, with the introduction of new\nequipment or technology, and when quality improvement mon-\nitoring or other data sources reveal a gap in skills or knowledge\nrelated to PN administration. \\textsuperscript{11} Home infusion nursing care\nproviders shall establish processes for periodic reassessment of\nknowledge and techniques used by patients or caregivers in the\ndelivery of PN in the home. \\textsuperscript{12} Studies of educational initiatives\naimed at reducing intravenous medication errors have not con-\nsistently produced the desired impact on error rates. \\textsuperscript{13} The opti-\nmal strategy (simulation, case scenarios, observation, etc) for\nproviding continuing education aimed at reducing medication\nerrors remains unclear, emphasizing the importance of using a\nvariety of educational strategies and maintaining vigilance in\nevaluating their effectiveness.\n\n<a id='e037b853-6491-4ca7-b25b-966032fdd1e2'></a>\n\nPolicies and procedures related to PN administration should address management of extravasation of PN formulations into perivascular or subcutaneous tissues. 14-18 Although most often associated with peripheral vein infusions, PN extravasation can occur with all types of vascular access devices (VADs). 11,17 A number of factors influence the extent of tissue damage, including pH, osmolarity, electrolyte content, and duration of tissue exposure. 17 No controlled trials are available for the management of PN extravasations, but consensus-based recommendations include stopping the infusion, aspiration of residual fluid, elevation of the limb, and application of cold therapy. 11,17 Treatment with hyaluronidase has also been described for extravasations of PN and hypertonic dextrose. 17,19 Education for nursing staff and nutrition support clinicians should include ongoing assessment of the vascular access site and appropriate interventions in the event of an extravasation.\n\n<a id='f1be5a7f-c4c2-4b45-b7ba-585f3bc2a7f1'></a>\n\nOrganizations must also develop policies pertaining to the administration of PN formulations brought in from home or from another facility. The inability to verify the stability and sterility of the formulation—as required by The Joint Commission standards—raises serious safety concerns. 20 The lack of medical and pharmacy review can potentially lead to\n\n<a id='1820d364-553a-4ea5-8d05-8ce631211f8e'></a>\n\nCAPTION ERROR\n\n<a id='3ba27aa5-fcd1-4d6c-99b4-a0692787a52e'></a>\n\nCAPTION ERROR\n\n<a id='1879cd57-a1b7-478c-af18-e5098bf92fe4'></a>\n\nTable 3.

Technological advances hold much prom-ise for improving the safety of PN administration. Yet only 33% of healthcare organizations report using CPOE for PN orders, while 20% employ barcode medication administration (BCMA).¹ Little evidence is available regarding the impact of these technological aids in reducing errors in the PN adminis-tration process. CPOE appears to offer benefits in preventing errors in the prescription and transmission phases rather than those associated with PN administration.²¹⁻²³ BCMA technol-ogy serves as an aid in verifying patient identity, but errors can\n\n<a id='518abc0f-8398-4a02-a03d-d7dcac7b3229'></a>\n\noccur when clinicians bypass the safety features of the system.\nComplex admixtures such as PN present challenges with\nBMCA systems because current technology cannot validate\nthat the label on a formulation containing multiple ingredients\naccurately reflects the contents of the PN container.\n\n<a id='6245fb64-35cb-4dee-b9a3-62a8ab668e1b'></a>\n\nInfusion pumps have long been seen as a requirement for PN administration.2,11 Yet despite their widespread use as a safety measure, pump-related mishaps stand out as a frequent factor in PN administration errors.4,6 At a minimum, infusion pumps should feature accurate volume (rate control), anti-free flow controls, and alarms for sensing air and pressure changes in the administration tubing, as well as dose error reduction software.11,24 Protocols for safe operation of infusion pumps shall stipulate rules regarding alarm silencing, modification, and disabling.\n\n<a id='1e476b6b-6140-46fc-86b5-bb41bba703a1'></a>\n\n326\n\n<a id='0ee0745d-095f-4199-8cb2-72bdba8fbeda'></a>\n\nJournal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition 38(3)\n\n<a id='a78af42b-d697-49a6-950c-53a0d0a239f8'></a>\n\nIn recent years, infusion pumps equipped with software designed to detect potential errors (\"smart pumps\") have become available, although conflicting information exists regarding the use of these devices. A recent gap analysis that specifically addressed current PN practices found that smart pumps are available in 29% of responding facilities.1 On the other hand, a survey of hospital-based pharmacies reported a usage rate of 77% for these devices.22 Smart pumps provide a safeguard against programming errors and capture data that can support quality improvement programs.25 When used properly, smart pumps reduce the potential for error, but this pump technology is not foolproof. If a smart pump drug library is bypassed or is used incorrectly or the infusion rate and volume are manually entered, a dose error can occur. One case study, for example, reported an incident in which a PN infusion was administered at 10 times the prescribed rate for 2 hours when a soft limit alert was bypassed.26 The advantages of smart pumps can be offset by the complexity of programming the pumps and maintaining a current drug library. To have a meaningful impact on patient safety, smart pumps must be integrated with BCMA and CPOE systems as well as hospital and pharmacy information systems.21 A comprehensive organizational commitment to the technology of smart pumps is essential to the successful deployment in clinical areas.25,27 Organizations should purchase infusion pumps with capacity to reduce errors due to incorrect programming. Whenever possible, infusion pumps should be standardized throughout the organization to promote user familiarity with the operation of the device.28\n\n<a id='8b9710be-dead-40e1-a661-bb3432ce9106'></a>\n\nQuality improvement. A critical step in efforts to improve the safety of PN is the implementation of quality improvement programs designed to track and analyze errors associated with PN administration.⁸ However, only 39.9% of organizations report having an ongoing quality improvement process for PN.¹ Proactive and reactive methodologies, failure mode effects analysis, root cause analysis, and the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) model should all serve as the framework for identifying high occurrence or high impact errors, closing practice gaps, and engendering continuous process improvement.²⁹,³⁰\nMultifaceted interdisciplinary approaches must foster a culture of safety, clarify problem areas, involve key stakeholders, test change strategies, and maintain channels of communication. These key concepts are most effective in bringing about and sustaining behavior change.²⁹\n\n<a id='169a7cff-b2f1-4b61-89d6-9684b322e15e'></a>\n\nAs noted earlier, smart pumps can serve as a valuable source of quality improvement data that allows organizations to track practices related to PN administration and identify interven-tions that address safety breaches.²⁵ However, without a reli-able wireless network, data retrieval can be labor intensive.²⁵,²⁷,³¹,³²\n\n<a id='8b6bff27-2490-4212-a943-7c1ceacdea59'></a>\n\nQuestion: Administration 2 (A2)\n\n(A2) What strategies can prevent errors in the verification\nphase of PN administration?\n\n<a id='8e639d0e-80d2-4f1b-bf32-a71c9c94789c'></a>\n\n## Recommendations\n\n1.  The verification process of PN administration should be presented in a bundle format, which uses a set of evidence-based interventions for a defined patient population or care setting.\n2.  Nurses, caregivers, and patients shall visually inspect the integrity of the PN container and formulation before spiking the container.\n3.  The PN label shall be verified against the original prescriber order. No verbal orders shall be accepted.\n    a. Check the patient identifiers, product name, route of administration (central vs peripheral), designated initiation time, infusion rate, and beyond-use date and time.\n    b. Match all components listed on the label of the formulation to the PN order.\n4.  A printed copy of the PN prescription shall be provided to home PN consumers initially and with each formulation change to allow this verification step.\n5.  Patient identity shall be confirmed using two identifiers according to organizational policy.\n6.  The administration tubing shall be traced to the point of origin in the body at the initiation of the infusion and at all handoffs.\n7.  An independent double-check process and verification of infusion pump settings should be performed by a second clinician before beginning the PN infusion and documented in the medical record.\n\n<a id='07df931d-6dbf-4c18-b911-a0662a9c8860'></a>\n\n## Rationale\n\nPN administration errors often stem from failure to adhere to the verification steps of PN administration, which parallel the \"five rights\" of medication safety that all nurses learn: right patient, right drug, right dose, right route, and right time.<sup>9,11</sup> Policies and procedures for PN administration should avoid broad directives to \"check the label\" but instead provide clear procedural guidance for each step in the verification process. This verification process should be presented in a bundle format, which uses a set of evidence-based interventions for a defined patient population or care setting. As with other bundles used in healthcare, all components of the verification process must be implemented together to achieve improvements in care.<sup>33</sup>\n\n<a id='dc45ad76-b4fe-43e9-b01e-85619feb2329'></a>\n\nAdherence to the \"five rights\" is not sufficient in preventing medication errors. Although human factors frequently contribute to errors, healthcare organizations have a responsibility to create an infrastructure that supports safe practice and reduces the potential for error.<sup>8,9</sup> This includes educating staff about the proper use and effectiveness of double-checks and creating procedures for reporting errors, near misses, and barriers to safe practice in a nonpunitive environment.<sup>8,9</sup>\n\n<a id='2895b8e8-4cd1-43f3-8b00-eec82464d809'></a>\n\nVerification procedures. PN formulations often resemble other products used in clinical care, such as bladder irrigation fluids,\n\n<a id='799b60d8-bc23-4233-afb9-eaa8950bd499'></a>\n\nAyers et al\n\n<a id='973243c7-6f0c-4e6a-93c3-3ac02366c49c'></a>\n\n327\n\n<a id='10ba385c-a435-4091-b0a1-0ca2661ee9dd'></a>\n\nenteral formula, human breast milk, and cardioplegia solu-\ntions, posing the risk for wrong-product or wrong-route errors.\nPractices related to the delivery and storage of these items can\nmitigate the likelihood of such errors, but the importance of the\nverification process as the final step before the point of patient\ncontact cannot be overstated.\n\n<a id='f775d15d-1c0e-463a-a3d2-5993f411607f'></a>\n\nNursing education for PN administration shall include infor-mation regarding management of potentially compromised or unstable PN formulations. This includes inspection of PN for-mulations prior to initiating the infusion and at regular intervals during the infusion. Any formulation that displays evidence of precipitants, particulate matter, or an unstable formulation shall be returned to the pharmacy for further investigation. 34\n\n<a id='b3c26dad-682b-4223-890f-568253b250f4'></a>\n\nOther examples of lapses in the verification process include PN administration to the wrong patient by the wrong route— infusing a central formulation via peripheral vein or through an incorrect tubing connection—or at the wrong rate.² The nurse or caregiver should be provided access to the complete original PN order to facilitate verification of all elements of the order (ie, patient identifiers, nutrient dosing, infusion rate, etc).¹\n\n<a id='f2ef7dfa-575b-4749-a1e0-58d37f42e8ad'></a>\n\nMistakes involving incorrect infusion rates are among the most common errors reported. Often, these errors are related to mistakes in programming a single infusion pump, but the risk for rate errors appears to increase when IVFE and dextrose/amino acid components are administered as separate infusions. 2,3,6 Errors involving incorrect infusion rates pose the greatest risk for patient harm due to the potential for causing life-threatening metabolic disturbances such as hyperglycemia or fat overload syndrome.\n\n<a id='dd6c55f5-58ae-48ef-91fe-2997d9c975eb'></a>\n\nTubing misconnections. Inadvertent catheter tubing misconnections have been recognized as a serious problem in healthcare. Although the administration of enteral feeding through intravenous devices has been associated with the most serious injuries, accidental connections between intravenous tubing and other systems that rely on Luer connectors have been reported, including epidural, intracranial, intrathecal, and tracheal tubing systems. 35,36 Because tubing used to administer PN must be changed every 24 hours, the potential for a misconnection occurs at more frequent intervals than with conventional intravenous fluids. Clear labeling on PN containers, tubing, and pump channels can reduce the risk of inadvertent misconnections. 32,37 However, the single most important risk reduction strategy is to trace all tubing back to its origin before connecting devices or infusions and to recheck connections and trace all patient tubes and catheters to their sources at the start of each shift and upon the patient's arrival to a new setting or unit as part of the hand-off process. 38,39\n\n<a id='ab124c84-5160-4430-9727-b614a4d0de34'></a>\n\n_Independent double-checks._ Reports of PN-related errors often recommend implementation of independent double-checks at critical phases of PN administration, such as order verification or programming the infusion rate into the\n\n<a id='4c9d7cf8-4c08-4f60-aad3-dfee2eda684d'></a>\n\npump. 2,3,6,7,32 To be effective, an independent double-check\nmust involve two clinicians separately checking the infusion\nsettings in accordance with the prescriber's order, alone and\napart from each other, then comparing results. 40 Although dou-\nble-checks serve as a valuable safety mechanism if performed\ncorrectly, the process may require up to 20 minutes of addi-\ntional nursing time. 40 Other barriers include a lack of clarity\nregarding the procedure for double-checking and a culture that\ndoes not fully support peer review. 41 Furthermore, excessive\nuse of double-checks can dilute the effectiveness of this safety\nmechanism. 40,42 Independent double-checks should not be\nimplemented to address problems that could be corrected\nthrough system redesign. 40 Nevertheless, organizations that\nhave identified errors in conjunction with a specific component\nof the PN verification process, such as order verification,\npatient identification, or pump programming, should imple-\nment double-checks strategically to avert potentially harmful\nerrors. For optimal effectiveness, independent double-checks\nshould be used in conjunction with other error reduction strate-\ngies and system changes aimed at reducing the risk of medica-\ntion errors. 40 The use of computer-generated checklists with\nPN infusion instructions has been suggested as a way to guide\nverification procedures without increasing workload demands,\nbut this approach requires further study. 5,43\n\n<a id='75448a7c-2152-4ea3-b91a-e6f730295ff6'></a>\n\nQuestion: Administration 3 (A3)\nWhat practices maintain patient safety during the infusion of\nPN?\n\n<a id='2c8e5cef-0da5-4184-ab5f-6cfe797342c2'></a>\n\nRecommendations\n\n1. PN shall be administered by or under the supervision of trained, competent personnel.\n2. Organizations shall establish evidence-based policies to guide the selection, insertion, care, and maintenance of VADs used to administer PN.\n3. PN protocols shall include measures to reduce contamination through manipulation of the catheter hub.\n4. VADs used for PN administration should not be used to obtain blood samples for laboratory tests unless no peripheral access is available.\n5. PN infusions shall be infused through a filter appropriate for the type of formulation.\n6. An occluded filter shall never be removed in response to occlusion alarms, thus allowing the unfiltered formulation to continue to infuse.\n7. Administration tubing should be attached to PN containers immediately prior to use.\n8.

For prolonged infusions of IVFE (20–24 hours), the daily dose should be divided into 2 parts, with a new container and tubing every 12 hours.\n10. Policies regarding PN multichamber bags should be developed using a multidisciplinary approach.\n11. The PN infusion shall be maintained at the prescribed rate:\n    a. Correct pump settings shall be verified at regular intervals and at each hand-off.\n    b. The PN infusion rate shall not be adjusted if the infusion is off schedule.\n    c. The rate of PN shall not be increased in response to changes in fluid needs; additional hydration should be provided as a separate infusion.\n    d. The PN should not be interrupted for routine care or patient transport for diagnostic studies.\n    e. Organizations shall develop policies regarding PN infusion and appropriate metabolic monitoring during surgery.\n12. The timing and frequency for blood glucose monitoring shall be based on clinical status and performed in a manner appropriate for the PN infusion schedule (cycled vs continuous).\n13. Caution shall be used when administering subcutaneous insulin coverage prior to a scheduled interruption of the PN infusion.\n14. In acute care acute settings (including long-term acute care), no additions should be made to PN formulations outside the compounding pharmacy; in home settings, additions to PN formulations should be limited in number and be made as close as possible to initiating the infusion.\n15. In long-term care facilities and in home care, education should be provided and caregiver competency regarding proper technique for the addition of prescribed additives to PN formulations should be verified.\n16. Co-infusion of medications through PN lines shall require a review of compatibility and stability data by a pharmacist.\n17. PN should be discontinued prior to transfer to another facility.\n18. The administration of PN and the patient's tolerance shall be documented in the medical record.\n\n<a id='b429767a-7b24-4703-80af-6473eb39edd0'></a>\n\n*Rationale*\n\nNursing care during PN infusion centers on administering the infusion as prescribed, preventing complications, monitoring metabolic stability, assessing progress toward therapeutic goals, and documenting patient response to therapy. This process includes safe and effective management of all medical devices and equipment used in the delivery of PN, safe administration of medications in conjunction with PN therapy, and optimal care of vascular access devices.\n\n<a id='39ba7b38-ae35-4eb6-b05e-9dceb43a1a4b'></a>\n\nMedical devices and equipment\n\nVascular access. Reliable vascular access is essential for safe and effective delivery of PN. A wide array of VADs are available, but some are better suited to PN delivery than others. Factors that influence the selection of a VAD for PN include the patient's medical condition, need for concomitant intravenous medication(s), the anticipated duration of PN therapy, and the setting in which PN is administered.\" In all care settings, the patient's views should also play a role in the decision-making process for VAD selection.\n\n<a id='61f265bb-0397-4483-b978-c306180179c3'></a>\n\nDespite their essential role in PN administration, VADs are a leading cause of serious adverse complications related to PN therapy, in particular, central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI). PN is an independent risk factor for CLABSI, requiring organizations to be especially vigilant in establishing policies to guide the selection, insertion, and care of these devices. 44 In recent years, widespread implementation of a bundle of evidence-based guidelines for insertion and maintenance of VADs has achieved substantial reductions in the CLABSI rates. 45 In addition to addressing VAD insertion and site care, PN protocols shall also include measures aimed at reducing contamination that occurs through manipulation of the catheter hub. Some organizations maintain policies requiring a dedicated line or lumen for PN administration, although studies have not yielded consistent results regarding the efficacy of this practice. 46\n\n<a id='359305e2-29c7-47fe-8035-0241160c3386'></a>\n\nMany organizational protocols for care of VADs discourage blood sampling from central lines as part of an overall effort to reduce manipulation and subsequent contamination of the catheter hub. For similar reasons, The Joint Commission has highlighted the use of VADs for blood sampling as a “practice to avoid.”47 One recent study of home PN recipients found an increased risk for CLABSI in patients who routinely had blood drawn from a VAD, leading these authors to conclude that PN catheters should not be used for obtaining blood samples unless no peripheral access is available.46 The elevated risk for CLABSI that is associated with PN administration warrants a multifaceted approach to CLABSI prevention that targets all pathways for VAD infection.\n\n<a id='174a8874-e67e-4eb8-9dff-06123ebcf717'></a>\n\nThe use of VADs for blood withdrawal not only increases the risk for microbial contamination of the line and hub, but samples drawn incorrectly from a VAD during PN infusion can also lead to spurious laboratory values. Binkley et al first drew attention to the danger of this phenomenon in a report of a 10-month quality assurance study.48 More recently, a year-long prospective cohort study in an academic medical center found 63 incidents of spurious blood work in 34 PN recipients.49 In both cases, investigators recount incidents of patient harm—typically hypoglycemia or hypokalemia—that resulted from unnecessary medical intervention for falsely elevated laboratory values.\n\n<a id='7aa0ea45-d191-46d2-8a1a-688e96462c3a'></a>\n\nFilters. In-line filters are required for PN administration to reduce the potential for patient harm due to particulates, micro-precipitates, microorganisms, and air emboli.⁵⁰ These devices\n\n<a id='8a142a8b-c4b0-4e70-b493-3a4f7d217fc5'></a>\n\nCAPTION ERROR\n\n<a id='43bd3d3b-e270-46af-8e74-10d41fb460bd'></a>\n\nCAPTION ERROR\n\n<a id='e62e205e-4789-40f3-9871-dfbcd86362f0'></a>\n\nshould be placed as close to the patient as possible on the admin-\nistration system. A 0.22-micron filter is recommended for a dex-\ntrose/amino acids formulation; a 1.2-micron filter is used for a\nTNA formulation. Because nurses must deal with the problem\nof pump alarms at the point of care, nursing competencies for\nPN administration shall include appropriate actions and trouble-\nshooting in response to high-pressure alarms or an occluded\nfilter. This education shall emphasize that a filter that becomes\noccluded during PN administration should raise suspicions that\nthe incorrect filter size has been used or that a precipitate or par-\nticulate is present in the formulation. When an occluded filter\ntriggers pump alarms, the PN infusion shall be stopped. Before\nresuming PN, a pharmacist should review the PN formulation to\ndetermine if incompatibility issues are the cause of the problem\nand to identify actions to prevent further occurrences.\n\n<a id='07bfdd94-4b63-45b4-8505-1b0ab42bd7c8'></a>\n\nFilters are manufactured for single patient use and should be changed according to the manufacturer's guidelines. The typical maximum use interval for PN filters is 24 hours. Due to the potential for contamination and subsequent release of endotoxin, filters should not be primed with PN fluid in advance—in the compounding pharmacy, for example. Instead, the filter should be filled with fluid immediately before initiating the infusion.\n\n<a id='5eb3c91d-5cd8-4ff9-9b64-bedd5b7a928f'></a>\n\nAdministration tubing and containers. PN formulations should be provided in a single daily bag, with the exception of IVFE that is administered as a separate infusion. The PN admixture should be kept refrigerated and protected from light exposure between the times it is dispensed until just before infusion. Exposure of PN formulations to ambient light generates peroxides and other degradation products, potentially contributing to oxidant stress. Concern regarding the clinical impact of this phenomenon has led to recommendations that PN be shielded from light, especially for neonates.⁵¹ However, studies have failed to demonstrate clear clinical benefits of shielding PN formulations from light. Partial light protection offers no clinical benefit. To reduce PN degradation, the container and tubing must be protected from light at all points from compounding through administration.⁵² Further research is required to determine if complete photoprotection of PN formulations can lead to improved clinical outcomes.\n\n<a id='12790dfb-91f9-4d2f-82a0-8f45a05244d3'></a>\n\nThe administration tubing should be attached to the PN\ncontainer, using sterile technique, immediately prior to initiat-\ning the infusion. Although there may be workflow advantages\nto spiking the container and priming tubing in advance, no\nstudies have examined the safety of this practice. Infection\ncontrol guidelines for non-nutrition intravenous fluids stipulate\nthat the infusion begin within 1 hour of inserting the tubing\nspike into the container. ⁵³ The issue of whether the risk of con-\ntamination could be reduced by spiking the PN container in an\nISO Class 5 environment or higher remains unknown.\n\n<a id='2c1c6210-4ea6-4011-aec4-aae61b41a156'></a>\n\nIVFE administered separately shall be appropriately labeled\nand administered in keeping with the organization's policies\nand procedures for minimum/maximum hang times. PN con-\ntainers and administration sets shall be free of the plasticizer\n\n<a id='36fa11fa-c606-4510-8ed2-45df3693d49a'></a>\n\ndi-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) to prevent DEHP contami-\nnation of TNA formulations and IVFE that are infused sepa-\nrately. 2,11 Guidelines for the frequency of tubing changes for\nPN formulations often make a distinction between admixtures\nthat contain IVFE (every 24 hours) and those that contain only\ndextrose and amino acids (no more frequently than 96\nhours). 11,44 However, these recommendations overlook the\npotential for contamination of the filter on all types of PN for-\nmulations. Therefore, administration sets and filters should be\nchanged with each new PN container. For continuous infu-\nsions, this interval will typically be every 24 hours; cycled PN\nwill require tubing and filter changes based on the hours of the\ninfusion. Administration sets used for IVFE infused separately\nshall also be changed with each new infusion (hang time 12\nhours). In cases in which a prolonged IVFE infusion is desir-\nable to promote tolerance, the daily fat emulsion dose should\nbe divided into 2 parts, with a new container and tubing used\nevery 12 hours. 54,55\n\n<a id='9b3b411f-95d8-4bcd-8bdb-971dd2e99b6a'></a>\n\nMultichamber PN bags are available, which are designed to reduce the risk for instability or precipitation. These multi-chamber bags separate components of the PN formulation with a bar or seal until just prior to administration. The contents of the chambers should be mixed and additives introduced by pharmacy staff prior to dispensing the formulation. 56 However, if these products are used in home care, patients and/or care-givers shall be provided with thorough training regarding the procedure for properly mixing the product before use. In addition, the containers should be accompanied by auxiliary labels alerting users to the need to mix the product prior to administration.57\n\n<a id='a7a038fd-115e-4552-b305-5a7a4fe17523'></a>\n\nInfusion practices. PN infusions should be administered according to the prescribed rate via an infusion pump. Nurses shall verify the correct rate when the PN infusion is initiated, at regular intervals during the infusion, and at hand-offs. ⁵⁸ Scheduled changes in the prescribed administration rate should be based on patient tolerance and metabolic stability. In acute care settings, PN is commonly infused continuously over 24 hours. However, a schedule in which the PN is cycled to infuse over 10 to 14 hours (based on patient tolerance) can offer physiologic and psychological benefits to patients in selected circumstances. ⁵⁹,⁶⁰ The conversion from a continuous to a cycled administration period typically takes place by reducing the infusion time by 4 to 6 hours each day until the infusion time has been compressed to the target duration. However, one recent study suggests that cycling PN to 12 hours can be accomplished in one step. ⁶¹ A report documenting a high incidence of adverse events associated with PN cycling underscores the importance of close patient monitoring during the transition to cycled PN. ⁶⁰ At each stage, the healthcare team must assess tolerance of the cyclic infusion before advancing to the next step.\n\n<a id='1ec0bde2-be2f-4ee6-bf09-e750f8cb50e8'></a>\n\nHyperglycemia, edema, or symptoms of fluid intolerance\nsignal the need for a more cautious approach to cyclic infusion.\nAdult patients tolerate abrupt discontinuation of PN without\n\n<a id='37c41377-a1b1-438d-bd52-0388363bef27'></a>\n\n330\n\n<a id='060455b2-56ff-431e-826f-fc97e849a247'></a>\n\nJournal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition 38(3)\n\n<a id='8b9dcec8-b7c4-48e9-b694-cebf5473a6a6'></a>\n\nexperiencing rebound hypoglycemia. 62 However, a 30- to 60-minute taper-down period is customarily used with ambulatory PN infusion pumps that perform this function automatically. 63 On the other hand, pediatric patients younger than 2 or 3 years old are prone to developing hypoglycemia with abrupt discontinuation of PN and therefore require more gradual taper-down procedures in conjunction with cycling. 59,60 During the transition to a cycled PN regimen, on-cycle and off-cycle glucose monitoring should take place daily. Once patient tolerance to cycled PN is established, less frequent glucose monitoring may be acceptable, especially in stable home PN patients. 64\n\n<a id='a6099957-9263-4fc8-b2ca-d866dc45d100'></a>\n\nWhen transitioning to cyclic PN, dosing regimens for insu-\nlin should be tailored to avoid abnormal fluctuations in blood\nglucose levels. In patients for whom PN is the sole source of\nnutrition, giving subcutaneous correctional dose insulin in the\nfinal phase of the cycle could lead to hypoglycemia when the\nPN infusion is discontinued. On the other hand, when PN for-\nmulations contain large doses of insulin, patients may require\nintermediate or long-acting insulin to prevent hyperglycemia\nafter the PN stops.\n\n<a id='d74475b0-8c25-493e-ad67-989eb07d4361'></a>\n\nUnscheduled interruptions in the infusion should be avoided because they may contribute to metabolic disturbances and suboptimal nutrient delivery. PN administration should not be interrupted for medication administration.⁴ PN should be discontinued prior to discharge or transport to another facility. As noted earlier, a taper-down period is a gradual reduction in the PN rate. Adult patients do not require a taper; however, a taper period for pediatric patients receiving PN prevents rebound hypoglycemia.\n\n<a id='a8802c19-ebf4-4b2f-9123-0fcf2fe21149'></a>\n\nThe risks of metabolic complications, particularly those\nrelated to glycemic control, have raised questions regarding\nthe safety of continuing PN during operative procedures.\nHowever, no studies have adequately examined this issue. One\nsurvey of pediatric anesthesiologists revealed a high degree of\nvariability in the clinical management of blood glucose levels\nin patients receiving PN during anesthesia. 65 As with other\nareas of PN administration, healthcare organizations should\ndevelop clear and consistent policies that address intraopera-\ntive PN infusion. When the PN infusion is continued during\nsurgery, the prescribed infusion rate should be maintained,\nwith close monitoring of blood glucose levels and insulin\nadministration as needed to maintain glycemic control. The use\nof PN infusions for fluid resuscitation shall be avoided.\n\n<a id='b032557e-490c-444e-bf09-e2c9385da28b'></a>\n\nMedication administration. Historically, PN formulations were viewed as convenient vehicles for delivery of medications such as heparin, insulin, and histamine (H₂) receptor antagonists. However, a better understanding of factors that impact the stabil-ity of PN formulations and the potential for drug-nutrient inter-actions warrants a more conservative approach to medication administration with PN formulations. The mixture of medica-tions in PN preparations is being addressed more specifically in A.S.P.E.N.'s forthcoming parenteral nutrition clinical guide-lines, which are to be published in the near future.\n\n<a id='9a986975-dea8-44bc-bd3f-7207f760ae9d'></a>\n\nIncompatibility reactions range from discoloration, degradation\nof nutrients or medication, and formation of precipitates, to loss\nof emulsion integrity in TNA formulations. The greatest risk for\nincompatibility exists with medications that are added directly to\nthe PN formulation due to the prolonged time of contact between\nthe medication and PN components with direct admixtures. 66\nStandardized commercial PN products that require further addi-\ntives prior to patient administration should be prepared in the\npharmacy under aseptic conditions. Therefore, in acute care set-\ntings, policies shall be implemented that prohibit the addition of\nmedication outside the compounding pharmacy. However, in\nhome care settings, stability considerations often require that\nmedication, such as multivitamin preparations or insulin, be\nadded to PN formulations prior to initiating the infusion. In this\ncase, the addition of medication should take place as close to the\nbeginning of the infusion as possible. Patient and caregiver\ntraining in the proper technique for adding medication to PN\nformulations shall be documented. The additions should be\nmade as close to the beginning of the infusion as possible to\nreduce the potential for harm should touch contamination occur\nduring this process.\n\n<a id='982500ea-c608-4724-b791-42910bb0ca55'></a>\n\nAs noted earlier, the optimal way to administer PN is through an IV line (one lumen of a multilumen VAD) reserved solely for that purpose. However, maintaining a dedicated line for PN administration may be impractical or impossible in patients who receive multiple IV medications or have limited vascular access.² Pharmacists must conduct a comprehensive review of stability and compatibility data from the literature and manufacturer of intravenous nutrients before a medication is administered in a PN formulation.\n\n<a id='b1f94761-d3b4-42d8-b13a-dd4573c5438e'></a>\n\nAs with all high-alert medications, PN should be administered as a primary infusion.37 Co-infusion of medication through the same tubing used for PN should also be avoided if possible. Compatibility information should be derived for PN that closely matches the formulation in question. Medication administration policies should explicitly detail safe practices with regard to medication administration in conjunction with PN.\n\n<a id='12ca4c07-58e2-473d-b7b8-41d908618a84'></a>\n\nDocumentation. Organizational policies and procedures shall define documentation practices related to PN administration in accordance with legal and regulatory requirements. This should include, but is not limited to, initiation and discontinuing times of the infusion, rate, route of administration, results of capillary glucose monitoring and laboratory tests, condition of the VAD, patient's response to therapy, progress toward therapeutic goals, and patient education provided.\n\n<a id='5ed6abac-9422-420a-8102-abc49550c997'></a>\n\nTopics for Further Research\n\n1.

Does education of prescribers improve PN ordering?\n2. What is the maximum safe osmolarity of PN admixtures intended for peripheral vein administration?\n3. What are the appropriate calcium intake and the calcium-phosphate ratios in PN for optimal neonatal bone mineralization?\n4. What are the clinical advantages or disadvantages of commercially available premade (\"premixed\") PN formulations compared with compounded PN formulations?\n5. What are the clinical (infection, catheter occlusion) advantages or disadvantages of 2-in-1 compared with 3-in-1 PN admixtures?\n6. What macronutrient dosing limits are expected to provide for the most stable 3-in-1 admixtures?\n7. What are the most appropriate recommendations for optimizing calcium (gluconate) and (Na- or K-) phosphate compatibility in PN admixtures?\n8. What micronutrient contamination is present in parenteral stock solutions currently used to compound PN admixtures?\n9. Is it safe to use the PN admixture as a vehicle for non-nutrient medication delivery?\n10. Should heparin be included in the PN admixture to reduce the risk of central vein thrombosis?\n11. What methods of repackaging IVFE into smaller patient-specific volumes are safe?\n12. What beyond-use date should be used for\n    a. IVFE dispensed for separate infusion in the original container, and\n    b. repackaged intravenous fat emulsion (IVFE)?\n\n<a id='7fb19dbe-119d-4121-9ffb-6ca34599b8d2'></a>\n\nCAPTION ERROR\n\n<a id='78416189-4124-4b5c-aa40-3e03acb083fa'></a>\n\n333\n\n<a id='3fa232dd-d7d0-41ae-9ff1-db2ec53c0413'></a>\n\n# Conclusion\n\nPN serves as an important therapeutic modality used in adults, children, and infants for a variety of indications. The appropriate use of this complex therapy aims to maximize clinical benefit while minimizing the potential risks for adverse events. Complications can occur as a result of the therapy, as well as the result of the PN formulation process. These consensus recommendations are based on practices generally accepted to minimize errors with PN therapy and categorized in the areas of PN prescribing, order review and verification, compounding, and administration. These recommendations should be used in conjunction with other A.S.P.E.N. publications, and researchers should consider studying the questions brought forth in this document.\n\n<a id='e9537215-75aa-4ea8-941b-fc80df9cb5d2'></a>\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThis unfunded project was completed by authors and reviewers using their time as volunteers.

In light of the need to revise A.S.P.E.N.'s *Safe Practices for Parenteral Nutrition* guidelines and to publicly address the safety of PN prescribing, compounding, and delivery, A.S.P.E.N. leaders hosted a multiorganizational safety summit on September 23, 2011. This summit brought together 46 key stakeholders to identify processes to improve the safety of prescribing, preparing, and delivering PN to patients across a variety of healthcare settings. Findings from this summit guided the A.S.P.E.N. PN Safety Task Force to develop safety consensus recommendations.",

Clinical Practice Guidelines Editorial Board PN workgroup, developed many clinical questions still unanswered in existing documents. The workgroups were divided into two segments, each responsible for specific tasks. The first group developed questions that could be answered with a high level of confi- dence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) process (the process by which the A.S.P.E.N. Clinical Guidelines are developed).⁵ The second group developed questions for which the level of evidence in the literature did not support any GRADE-level recommendations, meaning that consensus recommendations would depend on expert opinion. This paper addresses clinical concerns that impact PN safety for which current literature does not provide GRADE-level evidence and provides consen- sus recommendations for safe PN practice and future research based on expert opinion. These recommendations are not clini- cal guidelines as defined by A.S.P.E.N.⁶ The need to deliver practice information to clinicians, even when it is of a consen- sus nature from practice experts, remains an important role of A.S.P.E.N. Redundancies were deliberately built into this doc- ument between sections for users who may only view individ- ual sections based on their practice area. Reviewers of this paper included the A.S.P.E.N. Clinical Practice Committee, Dietetics Practice, Medical Practice, Nutrition Support Nurses, and Pharmacy Practice Sections, as well as clinical content experts outside of the organization. This document was also reviewed and approved by the A.S.P.E.N. Board of Directors. The questions to be answered with the Clinical Practice Guidelines GRADE process, listed in Appendix 1, will be addressed by a separate workgroup and published separately. This document should be used in conjunction with those guidelines.",

Deaths have occurred when safe practice guidelines were not followed.1 Appropriate and safe prescribing and ordering of PN is a critical first step and an essential component of the PN use process. The safe prescribing of PN requires a thorough knowledge of protein and energy requirements, macronutrients, micronutrients, fluid homeostasis, and acid-base balance. The prescriber shall be well versed in the appropriate indications for PN, basics in sterility and infection control, as well as vascular access devices (peripheral and central) and their associated complications. Safe prescribing of PN begins with PN-specific interdisciplinary education and institutional policies focused on writing clear PN orders. Furthermore, there shall be clear means of communication among physicians, physician extenders/mid-level providers (eg, nurse practitioners, physician assistants), dietitians, pharmacists, and nurses involved in this process. This section provides guidance and suggestions for healthcare institutions to adopt in order to promote safe prescribing of PN. Many of these recommendations have been adapted from literature of another high-alert therapy: cancer chemotherapy.2-4",

Electrolytes shall be ordered as the complete salt form rather than the individual ion.¹ Each individual macronutrient and micronutrient ordered shall be listed with its corresponding dose.¹ If available, the total ion amounts and concentrations may be reported or displayed to the prescriber within the PN order.\ni. The PN order template in CPOE systems should display current patient monitoring values and their date and time of entry to include parameters such as laboratory values, temperature, weight, etc.\nj. The PN order template should contain the full generic name for each ingredient. ¹,⁴ Proprietary names should only be used when multiple products exist and/or when the proprietary name may assist in identifying unique properties of the specific dosage form (eg, inherent electrolytes in amino acid formulations, fatty acids in IVFE).

The World Health Organization (WHO) advocates a systematic approach to prescribing in order to improve quality and minimize errors.² Pollock and colleagues described considering drug costs and using computer technology when prescribing medications.³ These approaches provide an excellent template for the clinician prescribing PN. The A.S.P.E.N. *Safe Practices for PN* document describes the benefits of using a standardized PN ordering process and recommends components that should be included on a PN order template (mandatory, strongly recommended, and worthy of consideration).¹\n\nLike PN, chemotherapy is a class of complex prescription medications with critical safety concerns. The American Society of Clinical Oncology and Oncology Nursing Society developed Chemotherapy Administration Safety Standards in the outpatient setting in 2009,²⁰ with revisions to expand these to the inpatient setting in 2011.⁴ The concepts in these safety standards are consistent with the A.S.P.E.N. Safe Practices for PN. We recommend that healthcare organizations and clinicians adopt these standards and guidelines when creating policies for ordering/prescribing PN.¹⁻⁴",

In addition, adopting a standardized PN order format designed with ingredients listed in the same sequence may improve consistency, and clarifying orders decreases the risk of errors when patients transition care from one setting to another. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality recently reported on a meaningful reduction in errors (from 9 to 2 per 1000 PN orders) at a children's hospital that adopted a standardized ordering and administration process for PN. Other observations included a reduced need for pharmacists to correct orders, a more efficient ordering and administration process, earlier delivery and administration, and an associated increase in staff satisfaction.⁶",

Simple processes (eg, a single-step \"renew order\" button) that lack this accountability should not be used. The following are categories for patients and examples for their corre-sponding monitoring frequencies:\n   a. Patients who are new to PN should be monitored daily until stable (more frequently if clinically significant metabolic abnormalities are found or patient is at risk for refeeding syndrome).\n   b.

However, the collaborative multidisciplinary care approach and application of safe practices guidelines have repeatedly proven to reduce complications, costs, and inappropriate use of PN.²⁶ It is reasonable to assume that patients newly initiated on PN, especially those with preexisting electrolyte abnormalities or at risk for refeeding syndrome or with unstable clinical status (such as those newly critically ill or postoperative patients), will require more frequent monitoring. Similarly, patients who have been stable for some time may need less frequent monitoring. Policies regarding the frequency of PN order renewals improve monitoring practices. Protocols for ordering PN may be designed such that laboratory values must be entered or acknowledged prior to submitting the order as is common in home infusion practice. Published guidelines and literature on prescribing should be adopted and reinforced and each healthcare organization shall include clinicians with expertise in the area of nutrition support, preferably from multiple disciplines in the prescribing process.⁵,⁶",

Prescribers from all disciplines, including physicians, pharmacists, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and dietitians, should be educated on basic PN prescribing and monitoring.\n2. Introductory didactic and experiential education/training about PN should be included in the core curriculum. Knowledge and skills should be evaluated for all clinicians in each discipline involved with PN as determined by the individual institution. Education and assessment materials and processes shall be developed and led by clinicians with expertise in the area of nutrition support, preferably from multiple disciplines.5,6\n3. In-depth education on PN should be included as a standard component of acute care and home care pharmacy and physician residency training. This is also applicable to all pharmacists, nurses, dietitians, physicians, physician extenders, and other clinicians involved in caring for patients who receive PN.",

Interdisciplinary teams, applying education as part of an overall quality intervention, have been successful in reducing unnecessary PN use and decreasing errors.²⁰ In general, participating in PN education programs has been associated with improvement in safer prescribing practices.²⁷ Such programs are well received by students who perceive a large gap in their training in safe prescribing practices.²⁸⁻³⁰ Safe prescribing, both in general and specific to PN, should be a component of all clinical training, including the core curricula of professional programs (medical, pharmacy, advanced practice nurse prescribers, nursing, nutrition, physician assistant, etc), residency, and specialty/fellowship programs for all who may be engaged in prescribing PN.",

PN formulations may contain more than 40 ingredients, including amino acids, dextrose, IVFE, electrolytes, vitamins, trace elements, insulin, and other medications. PN is considered a high-alert medication because significant patient harm may occur when this therapy is used in error.<sup>1,2</sup> A critical step in the PN process is a pharmacist's review and verification of PN orders. Breaches in the review and verification processes have resulted in errors and patient harm.<sup>1</sup> Healthcare organizations have the opportunity to improve the safety of PN therapy by optimizing technology for prescribing PN and transmitting PN order information as well as standardizing the PN review and verification processes.",

PN should be prescribed using a CPOE system that is fully integrated with an automated compounding device (ACD). \"Fully integrated\" is described to mean that the order entered into the CPOE system is trans-mitted electronically to the ACD without requiring reentry of any data and any modifications to an order are electronically transmitted back to the CPOE system for physician approval and signature.\n2. When PN formulations are outsourced to a third-party vendor for compounding, PN orders should be pre-scribed using a CPOE system and electronically trans-mitted to the vendor to avoid transcription errors.\n3. In the absence of a fully integrated system, PN should be prescribed using a standardized order template as an",

PN order data should be in a standardized format, including standardized sequence of ingredients, standard units, standard formulas, and formulation options¹ as described above in the Questions (P1–P2).\n6. If transcription into the ACD is required, the output of the PN order data should be formatted to support direct entry into the ACD without requiring reordering of the ingredients, manual calculations of amounts, or unit-of-measure conversions.\n7. Data should only be manually transcribed from the PN order into the ACD when absolutely necessary. Transcribed data should always be double-checked by independent processes to monitor accuracy.⁴ Multiple manual transcriptions of PN order data should be avoided.\n8. PN orders should be prescribed, transmitted, and compounded when supported by properly trained personnel who regularly perform this task.⁵ This is usually during the daytime hours.\n9. Vendors and application architects for CPOE systems should place priority on developing pathways for prescribing PN that support the prescriber with appropriate clinical decision support (as previously described), enforce standards of practice, and communicate directly with ACDs.\n10.

While some healthcare organizations use a CPOE system for prescribing PN, the majority continue to use paper order forms to prescribe PN, including handwritten orders.⁶⁻⁸\n\nOutsourcing pharmacies receive PN data in a variety of formats, including handwritten forms, which are commonly transmitted to the pharmacy. This may necessitate unit-of-measure conversion calculations, data manipulation, and transcription, which may result in errors. Editable electronic documents allow prescribers to complete orders and avoid the risks associated with handwritten orders.⁹,¹⁰ The lack of integration of the PN order with an ACD requires the manual entry of PN order data, which may lead to transcription errors.¹¹ A recent survey of PN practices reported that more than half of PN orders are",

One was the death of a 6-week-old infant who received a dose of sodium 60 times the prescribed amount.¹² The second report describes a PN order data entry error in which nutrients were entered into an incorrect PN template, resulting in a patient receiving a hypotonic PN formulation.³ Sacks et al also described a PN system in which PN order data were transcribed from a handwritten order into a hospital pharmacy computer and then reentered into the ACD, thereby increasing the risk for transcription errors.¹¹ If the PN process requires transcriptions, limiting the number of times data are entered from one system to another will decrease the risk of data entry errors. PN errors associated with incorrect calculations or converting units of measure have been reported and may result in patient harm. The ISMP reported the death of a neonate who received PN that included zinc at a dose 1000 times the prescribed amount. This error was the result of a calculation error in converting mcg/100 mL to mcg/kg/d.⁵",

Healthcare organizations shall have a policy and pro-cedure/protocol for standardized labeling of PN formulations.\n2.  Elements of the PN label include¹: (see Figure 3 and Figure 4)\n    a.  Two patient identifiers (eg, name, medical record number, date of birth)\n    b.  Patient location or address\n    c.  Dosing weight in metric units\n    d.  Administration date and time\n    e.  Beyond-use date and time\n    f.  Route of administration (central vs peripheral vas-cular access)\n    g.  Prescribed volume and overfill volume\n    h.  Infusion rate expressed in mL/h\n    i.  Duration of the infusion (continuous vs cyclic)\n    j.  Size of in-line filter (1.2 or 0.22 micron)\n    k.  Complete name of all ingredients\n    l.  Barcode\n    m.  All ingredients shall be listed in the same sequence and same units of measure as PN order.\n        *   All PN ingredients shall be ordered in amounts per day (for adult patients) or amounts per kilogram per day (for pediatric and neonatal patients) rather than in amounts per liter, per-cent concentration, or volume. \"Amount per day\" refers to macronutrients in grams per day and micronutrients in mEq, mmol, mcg, or mg per day.\n        *   Electrolytes shall be ordered as the complete salt form rather than the individual ion. Each individual macronutrient and micronutrient ordered shall be listed with its corresponding dose.\n        *   For home or alternative site PN labels, a list of patient/caregiver additives shall be included; these additives shall be easily identified and differentiated from the other PN components. Techniques to identify patient additives include highlighting or an asterisk to identify the addi-tives that are added just prior to administration.\n3.  Name of institution or pharmacy\n4.  Institution or pharmacy contact information, including",

The label may also include information on the amount of energy provided by each macronutrient or electrolytes intrinsic to the amino acids product.\n6. If IVFEs are infused separately (vs TNA), the essential elements of the IVFE label are: (see Figure 5 and Figure 6)\n   a. Two patient identifiers (name, medical record number, date of birth)\n   b. Patient location or address\n   c. Dosing weight\n   d. Administration date and time\n   e. Route of administration (central vs peripheral access)\n   f. Prescribed amount of IVFE and volume required to deliver that amount\n   g. Infusion rate expressed in mL/h\n   h. Duration of the infusion (not longer than 12 hours)\n   i. Complete name of the IVFE, even though label placed on original manufacturer container\n   j. Beyond-use date and time\n   k. Name of institution or pharmacy\n   l. Institution or pharmacy telephone number\n7. Labels for home PN formulations should be consistent with USP General Chapter <17>.21 (See Figure 7)\n   a. Organize the prescription label in a patient-centered manner.\n     * Organized in a manner that best reflects how most patients seek out and understand medical information\n     * Includes only the most important patient information needed for safe and effective understanding\n   b. Emphasize instructions and other information important to the patient.\n     * Prominently display information that is critical for patient's safe and effective use of therapy\n     * At the top of the label, specify the patient's name, drug name (spelling out full generic and brand name), and strength/dose. Include explicitly clear directions for use in simple language\n     * Directions should follow a standard format so the patient can expect that each element will be in the same regimented order each time the medication is received\n   c. Simplify language\n     * Language on the label should be clear, simplified, concise, and familiar, and should be used in a standardized manner. Only common terms and sentences should be used.",

The pharmacy-generated label is a critical tool used to compare the PN ingredients and administration information against the PN order. Standardized pharmacy labels for PN formulations provide information in a clear, uniform, and organized manner, and improves the verification processes for pharmacists.¹ Additionally, the label serves as a final check for those administering the PN, including nurses or patients/caregivers.¹²,¹³ Listing ingredients in a uniform sequence and units of measure removes the need for calculations and reduces the risk of misinterpretation. The misinterpretation of a PN label resulted in a child receiving an overdose of iron dextran and experiencing subsequent liver toxicity from iron overload.²² The lack of standardization has created confusion, especially when patients are transferred from one healthcare environment to another.²³",

Just like others involved in the PN process, it is difficult and stressful to keep current with the shortages. As noted above, the PN order and PN bag labels may not match as the result of changes in the compounding process. With some shortages, patients may require supplemental electrolyte or mineral infusions when the alternative product cannot be added to the PN formulation due to stability or compatibility concerns. Increasing the number of times the patient's intravascular device is accessed may increase the risk of catheter-related bloodstream infections.<sup>30</sup> A recent study of PN practices reported the consequences of PN product shortages. Of the pharmacists responding, more than two-thirds reported that valuable time is consumed in developing contingencies. Additionally, 70.3% of respondents indicated that shortages interfere with the ability to meet patients' micronutrient needs, and almost half reported that shortages interfere with ability to meet macronutrient needs.<sup>8</sup>",

Additionally, a lack of competency-based educational curriculum in schools of pharmacy or pharmacy technician training programs may contribute to PN errors. Very few suitable studies exist that characterize the formalized training of pharmacy students or technicians in the preparation of sterile products and admixtures. Available data suggest that when pharmacy students are formally taught aseptic technique skills with direct observation and assessment of parenteral compounding procedures, microbial contamination rates related to medium-risk level compounding (eg, PN compounding) decreased significantly from baseline toward the end of the 16-week course.¹ Several recommendations pertaining to the knowledge and competency of staff involved in the preparation of compounded sterile products were developed at the recent ISMP Sterile Preparation Compounding Safety Summit.² Surveys of pharmacists at the beginning of postgraduate training programs demonstrated that first-year pharmacy residents reported minimal experience (median = 2) on a scale from 1 to 5 (5, most experience and 1, no experience) with PN evaluations and IV admixtures. This suggests that there are educational deficits in current pharmacist training related to areas important for institutional or homecare pharmacy practice.³ Observational data from practicing hospital pharmacists and pharmacy technicians revealed that compounding error rates were 37% when PN formulations were manually compounded and 22% when prepared with an ACD. Errors included touch contamination, incorrect calculations performed by technicians, and bypassing the built-in safety check systems on ACDs.⁴",

Over the past 5 years, numerous reports of serious morbidity and mortality have appeared in the lay press due to a lack of training in aseptic technique with preparation of sterile products. The most recent tragic events have surrounded a rare outbreak of fungal meningitis that was traced to several lots of the injectable glucocorticoid methylprednisolone acetate compounded by the New England Compounding Center. Although these sterile injections were intended for back and joint pain, a lack of sterile compounding competency has sickened hundreds of patients and killed dozens. Even more relevant are the 9 deaths that occurred in Alabama during the preparation of amino acids under high-risk conditions and an error in sterile compounding technique. It is incumbent on pharmacists to check that all people involved in the oversight and preparation of CSPs obtain appropriate training and be evaluated on a regular basis through a competency assessment. Pharmacists would receive education in the physicochemical principles of pharmacy and practice experiences as part of a pharmacy school curriculum. Technicians would receive education in the operations of ACD hardware and software with varied practice experiences as part of the curriculum. Board certification for those involved in CSPs could guarantee a basic minimum requirement in lieu of",

The term \"hard limits\" refers to\nalerts that indicate that a component is outside a determined\nsafe range and shall not be exceeded; these are also referred to\nas \"catastrophic\" given patient outcomes if exceeded.² \"Soft\nlimits\" refer to alerts that indicate an unusual dose that requires\nfurther evaluation. Once addressed, any alert that is overridden\nor any dosing that is revised will require documentation of the\nrationale. Compared with manual methods, the software appli-\ncation available with ACDs should lead to improved com-\npounding accuracy, enforcement of proper compounding\nsequence, and a reduction in opportunities for human touch\ncontamination. However, preparing PN admixtures with an\nACD is not an error-free process. Error rates in compounding\ncomplex preparations such as PN admixtures have been\nreported to be 22% when automated in part and 37% when\nmanually prepared.⁶ Organizations may improve the safety of\nusing PN compounding systems by requiring that all doses\nbeing compounded pass through an order entry/clinical deci-\nsion support system and by ensuring that those systems' clini-\ncal decision support features are properly enabled and\nconfigured. Transcription of PN order data from an order-cal-\nculating software package into a compounding device should\nbe avoided. In a recent survey on PN use, Boullata et al found\nthat dose limit warnings were active in only two-thirds of orga-\nnizations that used ACDs for preparing PN formulations.⁷\nISMP Medication Safety Alerts from 2007 and 2011 described\nincidents in which adverse outcomes resulted, in part, from the\nabsence of dose limit warnings.⁸,⁹ In both instances, infants\nreceived lethal doses of a micronutrient (zinc in one case,\nsodium in the other) when a manual order entry error was\neither not detected by the existing dose limits or dose limit\nalerts were not active. After reviewing the incidents, ISMP\nmade a number of safe practice recommendations. Among\nthese was the recommendation to install, test, and maximize\nautomated dose-limit warnings in the pharmacy computer sys-\ntem and the ACD order entry system, particularly for high-alert\nmedications such as PN and its ingredients. Further, ISMP rec-\nommends that each organization develop weight-based dosing\nlimits applicable to their patient populations, as ACD vendor-\nestablished \"catastrophic\" limits may still allow entry of a\npotentially fatal dose into the software without issuing a\nwarning.⁸,⁹",

Proxy methods of verification (eg, syringe pullback) shall not be used.²\n19. If the manual method is being used, the process should be standardized to promote safety and efficacy.¹³ The use of a checklist or sign-off sheet shall be incorporated into the manual process.\n20. PN orders should be prescribed, transmitted, and compounded when supported by properly trained personnel who regularly perform this task.⁹ This is usually during the daytime hours.\n21. In facilities that care for adult, pediatric, and neonatal patients, the preparation of CSPs for each population shall be separated by time or location. Separation strategies can include the use of different colored bins for assembling products to be prepared.²\n22. At least three verification processes should occur in the pharmacy: (1) after initial order entry of PN, (2) before manually injecting additives into the PN, and (3) once the PN has been compounded.⁹ In-process or end-product testing requires that the PN preparation be held pending results. It may be better to fully automate and validate the entire PN compounding process to prevent errors from being made in the first place.\n23. Organizations should develop a drug conservation policy that addresses the handling and disposition of PN components (while maintaining their integrity and sterility) that may be in short supply due to market conditions, as these shortages can affect workflow conditions.\n24. The physical environment in which PN compounding takes place should be assessed in terms of lighting, interruptions and distractions, sound and noise, ergonomics, and medication safety zone. USP General Chapter <1066> describes optimal physical environment standards that promote safe medication use throughout the medication-use process.¹⁴ Any deficiencies should be addressed following organizational chain of command.\n25. Once a standardized process for compounding PN has been implemented, organizations should review and revise the process on an annual basis along with a review of personnel compounding behavior.\n26. Operation of the compounding process must be routinely observed for procedural compliance and corrective action must be taken immediately if noncompliance is observed.",

Bonan et al describe a multidisciplinary team's application of the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points method to preparation of anticancer drugs. 20 The team identified 11 critical points. Monitoring, control measures, and corrective actions were identified for each risk. Over a 10-month period, 16,647 chemotherapy preparations were compounded with 1157 nonconformities for the 11 critical control points. These included 693 compounding sheet errors and 131 analytical nonconformities. Aboumatar et al reported the outcomes of application of Lean Sigma solutions to the chemotherapy preparation process. 21 Once mistake-proofing interventions were introduced via workspace redesign, process redesign, and developing standard operating procedures for pharmacy staff, reported medication errors reaching patients causing an increase in patient monitoring decreased and the number of reported near misses increased.

In addition, the broad range of healthcare settings in which PN administration takes place—from critical care to home care—raises the potential for disparities to exist in the technology, equipment, and knowledge and skills of the nursing staff and caregivers responsible for PN administration. Although once uncommon, PN is administered with increasing frequency in long-term care and skilled nursing facilities. Regardless of the setting or the number of patients receiving the therapy in a given facility, the classification of PN as a high-alert medication requires healthcare organizations to develop evidence-based policies and procedures designed to promote safe PN administration and to validate the competence of those responsible for delivering this complex form of IV therapy.",

A recent gap analysis that specifically addressed current PN practices found that smart pumps are available in 29% of responding facilities.1 On the other hand, a survey of hospital-based pharmacies reported a usage rate of 77% for these devices.22 Smart pumps provide a safeguard against programming errors and capture data that can support quality improvement programs.25 When used properly, smart pumps reduce the potential for error, but this pump technology is not foolproof. If a smart pump drug library is bypassed or is used incorrectly or the infusion rate and volume are manually entered, a dose error can occur. One case study, for example, reported an incident in which a PN infusion was administered at 10 times the prescribed rate for 2 hours when a soft limit alert was bypassed.26 The advantages of smart pumps can be offset by the complexity of programming the pumps and maintaining a current drug library. To have a meaningful impact on patient safety, smart pumps must be integrated with BCMA and CPOE systems as well as hospital and pharmacy information systems.21 A comprehensive organizational commitment to the technology of smart pumps is essential to the successful deployment in clinical areas.25,27 Organizations should purchase infusion pumps with capacity to reduce errors due to incorrect programming. Whenever possible, infusion pumps should be standardized throughout the organization to promote user familiarity with the operation of the device.28",

Although the administration of enteral feeding through intravenous devices has been associated with the most serious injuries, accidental connections between intravenous tubing and other systems that rely on Luer connectors have been reported, including epidural, intracranial, intrathecal, and tracheal tubing systems. 35,36 Because tubing used to administer PN must be changed every 24 hours, the potential for a misconnection occurs at more frequent intervals than with conventional intravenous fluids. Clear labeling on PN containers, tubing, and pump channels can reduce the risk of inadvertent misconnections. 32,37 However, the single most important risk reduction strategy is to trace all tubing back to its origin before connecting devices or infusions and to recheck connections and trace all patient tubes and catheters to their sources at the start of each shift and upon the patient's arrival to a new setting or unit as part of the hand-off process. 38,39",

This education shall emphasize that a filter that becomes\noccluded during PN administration should raise suspicions that\nthe incorrect filter size has been used or that a precipitate or par-\nticulate is present in the formulation. When an occluded filter\ntriggers pump alarms, the PN infusion shall be stopped. Before\nresuming PN, a pharmacist should review the PN formulation to\ndetermine if incompatibility issues are the cause of the problem\nand to identify actions to prevent further occurrences.",

The appropriate use of this complex therapy aims to maximize clinical benefit while minimizing the potential risk for adverse events. Despite being classified and acknowledged as a high-alert medication,¹ only 58% of organizations have precautions in place to prevent errors and patient harm associated with PN.² Complications can occur as a result of the therapy and as the result of the PN process. These recommendations are based on practices that are generally accepted to minimize errors with PN therapy. However, the broad range of healthcare settings in which PN administration occurs—from critical care to home care—raises the potential for disparities to\n\n<a id='83152221-2618-47e8-b638-bb87f5c89029'></a>\n\nexist in the knowledge and skills of the healthcare professionals responsible for PN prescribing, review, compounding, and administration. Regardless of the setting or the number of patients treated in a given facility, the classification of PN as a high-alert medication requires healthcare organizations to develop evidence-based policies and procedures related to PN.\n\n<a id='49996e4d-e789-47f3-9971-0088d5e438f4'></a>\n\nFrom ¹Baptist Health Systems, Department of Pharmacy, Jackson,\nMississippi; ²Vitaline Infusion Pharmacy Services, Geisinger Medical\nCenter, Danville, Pennsylvania; ³University of Pennsylvania, School\nof Nursing, Philadelphia; ⁴Butler University College of Pharmacy and\nHealth Science, Indianapolis, Indiana; ⁵American Society for Parenteral\nand Enteral Nutrition, Silver Spring, Maryland; ⁶University of Michigan\nHealth System, Department of Pharmacy Services, Ann Arbor; ⁷Walgreens\nInfusion Services, Sun Valley, California; ⁸Infusion Pharmacy, Cleveland\nClinic at Home, Independence, Ohio; ⁹Department of Pharmacy Practice,\nHarrison School of Pharmacy, Auburn University, Auburn, Alabama;\n¹⁰Division of Preventive Medicine and Nutrition, New York Presbyterian\nHospital-Columbia University Medical Center, New York; ¹¹Thomas\nJefferson University Hospital, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\n<a id='666a3fa4-4fd2-4c20-9ae6-740cefc9f6ec'></a>\n\nReceived for publication October 3, 2013; accepted for publication\nOctober 3, 2013.\n\n<a id='94a2fe83-01bc-4567-9fa9-92fb6f33a294'></a>\n\nThis article originally appeared online on November 26, 2013.\n\n<a id='e9d9e20e-f89e-49e4-8c8b-53317370513f'></a>\n\n**Corresponding Author:**\nPeggi Guenter, A.S.P.E.N., Silver Spring, MD, USA.\nEmail: peggig@aspen.nutr.org\n\n<a id='9a58f883-de96-45b3-aadd-017096aba432'></a>\n\nAyers et al\n\n<a id='e0a9245d-3461-46dd-9776-9786af22c2ca'></a>\n\nCAPTION ERROR\n\n<a id='f95d4ce5-0dd4-4605-8ef8-a1c374647990'></a>\n\nConceptually, the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (A.S.P.E.N.) recommends use of the standardized process, which includes clinicians with expertise in the area of nutrition support.³\n\n<a id='88d4559a-af5e-4965-8f4e-cb5732e72681'></a>\n\nDuring the past few years, many circumstances and incidents have threatened the safety of patients receiving PN as an important therapy. In light of the need to revise A.S.P.E.N.'s *Safe Practices for Parenteral Nutrition* guidelines and to publicly address the safety of PN prescribing, compounding, and delivery, A.S.P.E.N. leaders hosted a multiorganizational safety summit on September 23, 2011. This summit brought together 46 key stakeholders to identify processes to improve the safety of prescribing, preparing, and delivering PN to patients across a variety of healthcare settings. Findings from this summit guided the A.S.P.E.N. PN Safety Task Force to develop safety consensus recommendations.\n\n<a id='1d3b3734-f5d9-42c8-b20c-3d6a90e48af5'></a>\n\nIn an attempt to answer as many questions about PN safety as possible, this Task Force, in partnership with the A.S.P.E.N. Clinical Practice Guidelines Editorial Board PN workgroup, developed many clinical questions still unanswered in existing documents. The workgroups were divided into two segments, each responsible for specific tasks. The first group developed questions that could be answered with a high level of confi- dence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) process (the process by which the A.S.P.E.N. Clinical Guidelines are developed).⁵ The second group developed questions for which the level of evidence in the literature did not support any GRADE-level recommendations, meaning that consensus recommendations would depend on expert opinion. This paper addresses clinical concerns that impact PN safety for which current literature does not provide GRADE-level evidence and provides consen- sus recommendations for safe PN practice and future research based on expert opinion. These recommendations are not clini- cal guidelines as defined by A.S.P.E.N.⁶ The need to deliver practice information to clinicians, even when it is of a consen- sus nature from practice experts, remains an important role of A.S.P.E.N. Redundancies were deliberately built into this doc- ument between sections for users who may only view individ- ual sections based on their practice area. Reviewers of this paper included the A.S.P.E.N. Clinical Practice Committee, Dietetics Practice, Medical Practice, Nutrition Support Nurses, and Pharmacy Practice Sections, as well as clinical content experts outside of the organization. This document was also reviewed and approved by the A.S.P.E.N. Board of Directors. The questions to be answered with the Clinical Practice Guidelines GRADE process, listed in Appendix 1, will be addressed by a separate workgroup and published separately. This document should be used in conjunction with those guidelines.\n\n<a id='f8afc0e0-376a-4d84-ba85-22db1ef4a576'></a>\n\nSimilar to A.S.P.E.N.'s Standards of Practice documents,\nthe following terminology is used with each recommendation\n\n<a id='6b1e013a-3986-41b6-b483-3dfadc1aa655'></a>\n\nto indicate the level of evidence and strength of consensus\nreached for each statement.\n\n<a id='80875b23-10b1-475a-bfbe-10d53d389f30'></a>\n\n\"Shall\": Indicates that the recommendation is to be fol-\nlowed strictly.\n\n<a id='f5239f02-d17b-490d-88c0-f5b29623141a'></a>\n\n\"Should\": Indicates that among several possibilities, one is particularly suitable, without mentioning or excluding others, or that a certain course of action is preferred, but not necessarily required.\n\n\"May\": Indicates a course of action that is permissible within the limits of recommended practice.\n\n<a id='1ac65d9f-2be4-4360-b213-256e25d449d3'></a>\n\nThe recommendations within this document are intended for discussion and adoption over time by organizations and individual professionals involved in the routine care of patients requiring PN. These **recommendations are not intended to supersede the judgment of the healthcare professional based on the circumstances of the individual patient.** Although the substantial focus of these recommendations is on institutional settings, many of the safety issues exist across other patient-care settings. Concerns that are unique to home care are also addressed where appropriate. In every clinical setting, it is the responsibility of the prescriber, pharmacist, nurse, dietitian, and nutrition support team to recognize and report all PN-related medication errors, whether or not they reach the patient. This allows the medication safety officer/committee to review and address these events periodically with the committee or individuals having oversight of PN.\n\n<a id='a113af2e-8727-4033-a411-bb3741453ea3'></a>\n\n# References\n\n1.

Deaths have occurred when safe practice guidelines were not followed.1 Appropriate and safe prescribing and ordering of PN is a critical first step and an essential component of the PN use process. The safe prescribing of PN requires a thorough knowledge of protein and energy requirements, macronutrients, micronutrients, fluid homeostasis, and acid-base balance. The prescriber shall be well versed in the appropriate indications for PN, basics in sterility and infection control, as well as vascular access devices (peripheral and central) and their associated complications. Safe prescribing of PN begins with PN-specific interdisciplinary education and institutional policies focused on writing clear PN orders. Furthermore, there shall be clear means of communication among physicians, physician extenders/mid-level providers (eg, nurse practitioners, physician assistants), dietitians, pharmacists, and nurses involved in this process. This section provides guidance and suggestions for healthcare institutions to adopt in order to promote safe prescribing of PN. Many of these recommendations have been adapted from literature of another high-alert therapy: cancer chemotherapy.2-4\n\n<a id='ff469448-4740-49ce-b992-e3e88b89bf53'></a>\n\nQuestion: Prescribing 1–2 (P1–P2)\n\n<a id='3039a3e1-2b18-41d2-8add-12510999a739'></a>\n\n(P1) Does a standardized process for PN prescribing increase clarity and reduce PN-related errors? (P2) What are the essential elements of a PN order that minimize errors?\n\n<a id='ba63677c-a065-4c28-99fa-1a98f94809c2'></a>\n\n# Recommendations\n\n1. Healthcare organizations shall use a standardized pro-cess for PN management, and this process shall include clinicians with expertise in the area of nutrition sup-port, preferably from multiple disciplines.<sup>5,6</sup>\n   a. Healthcare organizations shall develop written policies and procedures for all aspects of PN ther-apy in the manner described in the A.S.P.E.N. *Safe Practices for Parenteral Nutrition*.<sup>1</sup>\n   b. The patient and caregivers shall be informed of the risks and benefits associated with PN.\n   c. A comprehensive PN education program and competency assessment shall be developed for healthcare professionals who are involved in the care of patients receiving PN therapy, and competency should be assessed at least annu-ally.<sup>4</sup>\n   d. Healthcare organizations shall have a writ-ten policy addressing credentials, training, and\n\n<a id='d1a3c515-1f33-4b78-8546-22b130f96792'></a>\n\ncompetency certification(s) required of clinicians who prescribe PN.⁴\n\n2. The primary healthcare team, in collaboration with nutrition support professionals, shall evaluate, clearly define, and accurately document the patient's medical problem(s) and indication(s) for PN.\n   a. The patient shall have an appropriate indication for PN therapy based on published guidelines and evidence for the use of PN, which shall be documented in the medical record.¹\n   b. The healthcare team shall confirm that the patient has appropriate intravenous (IV) access for PN prior to prescribing PN therapy.¹\n   c. The indication(s) for PN and appropriate IV access shall be included on the PN order (see section 4 and Table 1).¹\n\n3. The primary healthcare team, in collaboration with nutrition support professionals, shall specify and document the therapeutic goal(s) of PN therapy.\n   a. Appropriate energy and protein goals shall be determined for the patient's condition based on published guidelines and evidence.¹\n   b. Appropriate parameters and frequency of monitoring shall be determined for the patient's condition to assess efficacy, detect and prevent complications, evaluate changes, and document outcomes.¹\n   c. Appropriate monitoring parameters for PN shall include fluid requirements, serum electrolyte concentrations, serum glucose concentrations, hepatic function, renal function, serum triglyceride concentrations, and signs or symptoms of vascular access device complications.¹\n   d. Therapeutic goals should be established for PN, including end points, response to treatment, and treatment failure.\n\n4. PN shall be prescribed using a standardized PN order format and review process applicable to patients of every age and disease state within a healthcare organization. ¹,⁶\n   a. Standardized electronic PN orders (eg, a computerized prescriber order entry [CPOE] system) should be used to prescribe PN for all patients. ¹,⁷⁻⁹ Handwritten orders to prescribe PN should be avoided due to potential for error. Verbal and telephone orders for PN should be avoided.\n   b. Clinical decision support should be available within electronic PN orders to alert and prevent prescribers from ordering doses of macronutrients, micronutrients, and/or medications that exceed recommended/safe clinical limits or that exceed limits of compatibility (eg, hard limits when maximum concentrations have been exceeded). ¹,⁷,⁸\n\n<a id='08cf4124-e9bd-4001-b2d4-79a1b13517a8'></a>\n\nCAPTION ERROR\n\n<a id='a6053387-2469-48bb-8dec-6b32349fe448'></a>\n\nCAPTION ERROR\n\n<a id='df88dc18-9bf7-4438-9ec7-19799fd88d8f'></a>\n\nc. When a CPOE system is not available, PN should be prescribed using a standardized order template as an editable electronic document in order to avoid handwritten orders.\nd. PN order templates shall be designed so they are clear and easily understood by all healthcare professionals involved in the care of patients receiving PN.¹\ne. Table 1 lists components that shall be included on the PN order. ¹,⁴\nf. All PN order templates should include the required components listed in the sequence in Table 1. This sequence should match the PN labels as well. See Figure 1 and Figure 2 for PN Order Templates.\ng. In the event of a product shortage, PN component conservation and allocation strategies should include the A.S.P.E.N. parenteral nutrition shortage considerations for multivitamins, trace elements, IV fat emulsions (IVFE), amino acids, electrolyte/minerals, and cysteine, ¹⁰⁻¹⁵ and the PN order format should be updated accordingly. Multivitamins shall be prescribed daily in PN admixtures. When multivitamin products are not available, thiamine, ascorbic acid, pyridoxine, and folic acid should be prescribed daily. ¹⁰\nh. All PN ingredients shall be ordered in amounts per day (eg, for adult patients) or amounts per kilogram per day (eg, pediatric and neonatal patients) rather than in amounts per liter, percent concentration, or volume.¹ Amount per day refers to macronutrients in grams per day, and micronutrients in mEq, mmol, mcg, or mg per day. Electrolytes shall be ordered as the complete salt form rather than the individual ion.¹ Each individual macronutrient and micronutrient ordered shall be listed with its corresponding dose.¹ If available, the total ion amounts and concentrations may be reported or displayed to the prescriber within the PN order.\ni. The PN order template in CPOE systems should display current patient monitoring values and their date and time of entry to include parameters such as laboratory values, temperature, weight, etc.\nj. The PN order template should contain the full generic name for each ingredient. ¹,⁴ Proprietary names should only be used when multiple products exist and/or when the proprietary name may assist in identifying unique properties of the specific dosage form (eg, inherent electrolytes in amino acid formulations, fatty acids in IVFE). Any abbreviations shall follow The Joint Commission standards on abbreviations. ⁴,¹⁶ Abbreviations on\n\n<a id='4705f1f4-52bd-433a-abaa-2e84c2b82538'></a>\n\nthe Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP)\nlist of error-prone abbreviations, symbols, and\ndose designations shall not be used.<sup>17</sup>\nk. The PN order should include related orders for\nroutine care, laboratory tests, and relevant moni-\ntoring parameters.<sup>1</sup>\nl. Prescribing a PN formulation that includes non-\nnutrient medications should be avoided. When no\nother reasonable alternatives exist, non-nutrient\nmedications shall only be included on the PN\norder if data support compatibility/stability.<sup>1</sup>\nm. Healthcare organizations should develop poli-\ncies and/or protocols to allow modification of PN\norders when potential incompatibilities may exist\n(eg, incompatibilities associated with calcium and\nphosphate salts, adjustment of IVFE dosing when\nit is not expected to be stable as a total nutrient\nadmixture [TNA] [ordering IVFE separately or\nadjusting IVFE dosing such that the daily dose\nachieves minimum concentration for stability]).<sup>1</sup>\nAll PN order modifications shall be communi-\ncated to the healthcare team and documented in\nthe medical record. PN orders shall be signed by a\nlicensed prescriber who has been credentialed by\nthe healthcare organization to prescribe PN.<sup>4</sup>\nn. PN orders should be prescribed with a time limi-\ntation to allow for appropriate patient evaluation\nat predetermined intervals based on clinical status\nand required level of care.<sup>1-4</sup>\no. For optimal safety, PN orders should be pre-\nscribed and transmitted when supported by prop-\nerly trained personnel who regularly perform\nthis task. This is usually done during daytime\nhours.<sup>18</sup>\n5. Institutions shall create a home PN order template/for-\nmat that provides a safe plan for multiple days of ther-\napy. The prescription for home PN therapy should be\nwritten in a format that specifically reflects trends in\nlaboratory values and previous days of PN therapy. An\ninstitutional daily PN order format should not be used\nas a home PN prescription.\n6. The most appropriate nutrition modality, in collabora-\ntion with nutrition support professionals, should be\nprescribed for the patient. Healthcare organizations\nshould determine the most appropriate types of PN\nformulation(s) for their patient population(s) (eg, stan-\ndardized compounded, standardized commercial [pre-\nmixed] PN products, or customized compounded PN\nadmixtures) or methods of delivery (eg, dextrose/\namino acid vs total nutrient admixtures) and should\ndevelop criteria for each formulation that will be used\nin their patients.<sup>19</sup>\n\n<a id='fc05c8ba-f0cb-4c26-a629-75baa70c5a63'></a>\n\nCAPTION ERROR\n\n<a id='d3e88dd3-f67a-4e03-8444-af2f65636166'></a>\n\nJournal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition 38(3)\n\n<a id='7608b000-1414-46d8-a9c1-1e488bfd8e9f'></a>\n\nTable 1.

The World Health Organization (WHO) advocates a systematic approach to prescribing in order to improve quality and minimize errors.² Pollock and colleagues described considering drug costs and using computer technology when prescribing medications.³ These approaches provide an excellent template for the clinician prescribing PN. The A.S.P.E.N. *Safe Practices for PN* document describes the benefits of using a standardized PN ordering process and recommends components that should be included on a PN order template (mandatory, strongly recommended, and worthy of consideration).¹\n\nLike PN, chemotherapy is a class of complex prescription medications with critical safety concerns. The American Society of Clinical Oncology and Oncology Nursing Society developed Chemotherapy Administration Safety Standards in the outpatient setting in 2009,²⁰ with revisions to expand these to the inpatient setting in 2011.⁴ The concepts in these safety standards are consistent with the A.S.P.E.N. Safe Practices for PN. We recommend that healthcare organizations and clinicians adopt these standards and guidelines when creating policies for ordering/prescribing PN.¹⁻⁴\n\n<a id='b7088134-f0f9-4150-8a4c-87625fdc0d7d'></a>\n\nStandardized order formats for PN incorporating prescriber guidelines can provide education that can lead to reduced prescribing errors, improved efficiency/productivity, and ultimately reduced costs and waste. In addition, adopting a standardized PN order format designed with ingredients listed in the same sequence may improve consistency, and clarifying orders decreases the risk of errors when patients transition care from one setting to another. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality recently reported on a meaningful reduction in errors (from 9 to 2 per 1000 PN orders) at a children's hospital that adopted a standardized ordering and administration process for PN. Other observations included a reduced need for pharmacists to correct orders, a more efficient ordering and administration process, earlier delivery and administration, and an associated increase in staff satisfaction.⁶\n\n<a id='a1dc5ba7-d901-4c60-9369-fa5ffa9d5c14'></a>\n\nThe use of electronic or computerized PN orders can also improve efficiency and safety and reduce errors. Maat and colleagues demonstrated a significant 16% time reduction for simple and a 60% time reduction for complex calculations related to PN prescribing in neonates when using a CPOE system with basic clinical decision support.<sup>7</sup> Brown and colleagues completed a retrospective cross-sectional study evaluating the impact of an interactive computerized PN worksheet on PN-prescribing\n\n<a id='7c7847b0-b476-4bf6-ad67-ba8ba92c243e'></a>\n\nCAPTION ERROR\n\n<a id='2a531e3b-d6af-46dd-a745-e54d33880273'></a>\n\nCAPTION ERROR\n\n<a id='015b8e27-777f-4543-9739-473166b40585'></a>\n\n### Patient Information\n\nPatient name____________________ Medical record number____________________ Birthdate/age____________________\n\nPatient location____________________ Allergies____________________\n\nHeight and dosing weight: Ht:____________ cm Dosing Wt:____________ kg\n\nDiagnosis(es)/Indication(s) for PN____________________\n\nVascular access device/location CVC type____________________ Location____________________\n\nAdministration date/time____________________\n\nBase Formula\n\nAmino acids                                                               g\n\nDextrose                                                                  g\n\nIV Fat emulsion                                                           g\n\nElectrolytes\n\nSodium phosphate                                                          mmol\n\nSodium chloride                                                           mEq\n\nSodium acetate                                                            mEq\n\nPotassium phosphate                                                       mmol\n\nPotassium chloride                                                        mEq\n\nPotassium acetate                                                         mEq\n\nMagnesium sulfate                                                         mEq\n\nCalcium gluconate                                                         mEq\n\nVitamins, Trace Elements, Additives\n\nMulti-component vitamins                                                  mL\n\nMulti-component Trace elements                                            mL\n\nOther Additives (eg, individual vitamins or trace elements, cysteine, regular insulin) as clinically appropriate and compatible\n\n### PN Instructions\n\nTotal volume____________ mL Infusion rate____________ mL/hr , start and stop times____________\n\nCycle information____________________\n\nPrescriber and contact information____________________\n\nFigure 1.

The worksheet was developed using commonly available\nspreadsheet software (ie, not part of an integrated CPOE sys-\ntem), but still required separate entry and transcription of the PN\norder. While use of the worksheet was associated with a reduc-\ntion in the prescribing error rate, all of the errors that did occur\nwere attributed to transcription or data entry mistakes.⁹\nShamliyan and colleagues completed a review of studies to\nexamine the association between computerization of physician\norders and prescribing medication orders.⁸ Computerized orders\nwere associated with a 43% reduction in dosing errors, 37.5%\nreduction in adverse drug events, and 66% reduction in total pre-\nscribing errors in adults.⁸ Of the studies included in this review,\n80% reported a significant reduction in total prescribing errors.⁸\nWhile these data are not specific to PN therapy, they do highlight\nthe benefits of CPOE on the medication use process and associ-\nated errors and adverse drug events.\n\n<a id='246fd9f4-de44-491d-bbf5-205846f7da9a'></a>\n\nThe ISMP reported a case of a 16-year-old boy who received a PN order in which the ingredients were ordered in amounts per kg, but the PN admixture was prepared in amounts per day.²¹ This resulted in infusion of a hypo-osmolar PN admixture (138 mOsm/L) with very low doses of nutrients (eg, protein and dextrose both at 1 g/d rather than 1 g/kg/d) for almost an entire day before it was identified (no adverse effects were incurred by the patient). There were multiple failures across the entire medication use process in this scenario. For example, the PN order template in the CPOE system did not match the template in the pharmacy system/Automated Compounding Device (ACD). Further, there was a lack of clinical decision support and automated warnings in both the CPOE PN order template and the ACD, a lack of redundancies in the process, and multiple points of transcription. ISMP provided several safe practice recommendations²¹:\n\n<a id='c481999a-e792-484e-8b57-306651ac7bf1'></a>\n\nCAPTION ERROR\n\n<a id='34fe4ff2-6a84-4540-b5cf-ab163b1d08a0'></a>\n\nJournal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition 38(3)\n\n<a id='65d91626-90f8-4e7f-bfbd-60dd621aacef'></a>\n\nPatient Information\n\nPatient name____________________ Medical record number____________________ Birthdate/age____\nPatient location____________________ Allergies____________________\n\nHeight and dosing weight: Ht:____ cm Dosing Wt:____ kg\nDiagnosis(es)/Indication(s) for PN____________________\nVascular access device/location CVC type____________________ Location____________________\nAdministration date/time____________________\n\nBase Formula\nAmino acids g\nDextrose g\nIV Fat emulsion g\nElectrolytes\nSodium phosphate mmol\nSodium chloride mEq\nSodium acetate mEq\nPotassium phosphate mmol\nPotassium chloride mEq\nPotassium acetate mEq\nMagnesium sulfate mEq\nCalcium gluconate mEq\nVitamins, Trace Elements, Additives\nMulti-component vitamins mL\nMulti-component trace elements mL\nOther Additives (eg, cysteine, regular insulin) as clinically appropriate and compatible\n\nPN Instructions\nTotal volume____ mL Infusion rate____ mL/hr , start and stop times____\nCycle information____________________\nPrescriber and contact information____________________\n\n<a id='ded021e9-80b1-44ed-96b2-d5de8fce6a5f'></a>\n\n**Figure 2.** Parenteral Nutrition Order Template: Pediatric/Neonatal Patient.\n\n<a id='81ca0938-ff32-4262-9a35-34396df013b6'></a>\n\n- Match prescribing and pharmacy templates\n- Build, test, and heed automated warnings\n- Heighten suspicions of errors\n- Carry out effective redundancies\n- Provide clear labeling (and the label should always match the PN order template in the PN order form/ CPOE system and the ACD)\n- Educate and validate competency\n- Eliminate transcription of PN orders\n\n<a id='fed47019-8efb-4814-80c5-6511c7132522'></a>\n\nDespite the potential advantages of CPOE, use of CPOE with respect to PN orders appears to be limited. A 2011 survey of PN practices noted that a CPOE system was used for PN orders in only 33% of the surveyed organizations.²² Most recently, Radley et al conducted a systematic review of the literature and derived a summary estimate of the effect of CPOE using a random effects meta-analytic technique. Their pooled analysis revealed that implementing CPOE was associated with a 48% (95% CI,\n\n<a id='9c4259b3-8f4b-4d3a-917f-32f57b639cb7'></a>\n\n41%–55%) reduction in medication error rates. They further\nestimated that as many as 104 million medication errors could be\naverted annually if all hospitals fully adopted CPOE to process\nall medication orders. 23 To the best of our knowledge, only one\nlarge commercial Health Information System–Electronic\nMedical Record/CPOE system provides even rudimentary PN\ncalculation or decision support capability.\n\n<a id='00917a1e-3ac9-4c5d-8ae2-13b6daa63f48'></a>\n\nQuestion: Prescribing 3 (P3)\n\n(P3) What improvements in the physical environment would promote safe PN ordering and use?\n\n<a id='b5293c9f-62ca-4480-8bcb-de4934e29786'></a>\n\n*Recommendations*\nInstitutions shall meet the following requirements for the physi-\ncal environment as described in The United States Pharmacopeial\nConvention, USP General Chapter <1066>:\n\n<a id='15c468f2-4ff1-4074-b465-68e9334d8dbc'></a>\n\nAyers et al\n\n<a id='94f513e8-253c-4b3f-b2c0-d8e3184f8fec'></a>\n\nCAPTION ERROR\n\n<a id='a928f322-dfb9-480f-9322-6720e584fec5'></a>\n\n1.

Physical design and organization of work space: The design of the workplace environment can influence the effectiveness of the prescriber to perform tasks.²⁴ USP <1066> promotes ergonomic design of the workplace environment. Factors such as counter height, height of supplies, drawer lighting, and work clutter are noted to influence efficiency as well as safety.\n5. Medication safety zones: Defined as a critical area where medications are prescribed, orders are entered into a computer or transcribed onto paper documents, and where medications are prepared, dispensed, or administered.²⁴\n\n<a id='82510afb-a9eb-44b9-a5a3-0048c246eb13'></a>\n\n# Rationale\n\nThe process of ordering/prescribing PN is very complex and requires an environment that promotes safety. According to the United States Pharmacopeia (USP), the work environment has been identified as one of the most common reported factors known to contribute to medication errors.²⁴ In October 2010, The United States Pharmacopeial Convention published an official bulletin titled *Physical Environments That Promote Safe Medication Use, General Chapter <1066>*. This chapter focuses on the characteristics of the physical environment that are essential to promoting accurate medication use.²⁴ These guidelines provide an excellent resource to promote safe prescribing for the nutrition support clinicians to incorporate into their practice.\n\n<a id='a3b4eb2b-9dc5-4182-aa18-297b102500ad'></a>\n\n**Question: Prescribing 4 (P4)**\n(P4) How often should the PN prescription be reordered after\nthe initial order?\n\n1. An institution-specific or organization-specific policy\nshould be created to dictate the duration of a PN\norder.\n\n<a id='cede35ab-2c85-411c-814e-72ab02de3811'></a>\n\n2. When reordering PN, each PN component should be reordered in its entirety, including full generic names and doses.\n3. Patients with newly initiated PN should be monitored and have their orders reviewed more frequently.\n4. The reordering process should be structured to require accountability for reviewing the orders, laboratory findings, and patient's condition. Simple processes (eg, a single-step \"renew order\" button) that lack this accountability should not be used. The following are categories for patients and examples for their corre-sponding monitoring frequencies:\n   a. Patients who are new to PN should be monitored daily until stable (more frequently if clinically significant metabolic abnormalities are found or patient is at risk for refeeding syndrome).\n   b. Patients in an unstable clinical condition (eg, acutely ill, critically ill, recovering from critical illness, recent surgery) should be monitored daily until stable (more frequently if clinically signifi-cant abnormalities are observed).\n   c. Stable patients in the hospital with no required changes in formulation for 1 week should be mon-itored every 2 to 7 days.\n   d. Stable patients in a hospital, long-term care, or home setting with no changes in formulation for more than 1 week should be monitored every 1 to 4 weeks or longer in select clinically stable patients.\n\n<a id='f493cd5c-5414-4d45-8ef3-5f7a119b17f7'></a>\n\n# Rationale\n\nThere are no known studies that examine whether the duration of a PN order or the frequency with which such orders are renewed impacts outcomes or safety measures. However, the collaborative multidisciplinary care approach and application of safe practices guidelines have repeatedly proven to reduce complications, costs, and inappropriate use of PN.²⁶ It is reasonable to assume that patients newly initiated on PN, especially those with preexisting electrolyte abnormalities or at risk for refeeding syndrome or with unstable clinical status (such as those newly critically ill or postoperative patients), will require more frequent monitoring. Similarly, patients who have been stable for some time may need less frequent monitoring. Policies regarding the frequency of PN order renewals improve monitoring practices. Protocols for ordering PN may be designed such that laboratory values must be entered or acknowledged prior to submitting the order as is common in home infusion practice. Published guidelines and literature on prescribing should be adopted and reinforced and each healthcare organization shall include clinicians with expertise in the area of nutrition support, preferably from multiple disciplines in the prescribing process.⁵,⁶\n\n<a id='d4248182-2e12-4a23-9d12-ce65af1416bc'></a>\n\n304\n\n<a id='2dfcec0e-09fc-4db4-9960-9435ea32d943'></a>\n\nJournal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition 38(3)\n\n<a id='7b9de34b-14de-4d6a-be03-d5bc2115a938'></a>\n\nQuestion: Prescribing 5 (P5)\n(P5) How can education be provided to non-nutrition support\nspecialist clinicians to improve PN prescribing and safety?\n\n<a id='d4421708-cebb-467e-aa51-018e27e67cb5'></a>\n\nRecommendations\n1. Prescribers from all disciplines, including physicians, pharmacists, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and dietitians, should be educated on basic PN prescribing and monitoring.\n2. Introductory didactic and experiential education/training about PN should be included in the core curriculum. Knowledge and skills should be evaluated for all clinicians in each discipline involved with PN as determined by the individual institution. Education and assessment materials and processes shall be developed and led by clinicians with expertise in the area of nutrition support, preferably from multiple disciplines.5,6\n3. In-depth education on PN should be included as a standard component of acute care and home care pharmacy and physician residency training. This is also applicable to all pharmacists, nurses, dietitians, physicians, physician extenders, and other clinicians involved in caring for patients who receive PN.\n\n<a id='7d0809c4-5542-41e4-b22e-a41c10742371'></a>\n\n## Rationale\n\nThere are few known studies evaluating the impact of safe prescribing education programs on the outcomes of patients receiving PN. Interdisciplinary teams, applying education as part of an overall quality intervention, have been successful in reducing unnecessary PN use and decreasing errors.²⁰ In general, participating in PN education programs has been associated with improvement in safer prescribing practices.²⁷ Such programs are well received by students who perceive a large gap in their training in safe prescribing practices.²⁸⁻³⁰ Safe prescribing, both in general and specific to PN, should be a component of all clinical training, including the core curricula of professional programs (medical, pharmacy, advanced practice nurse prescribers, nursing, nutrition, physician assistant, etc), residency, and specialty/fellowship programs for all who may be engaged in prescribing PN.\n\n<a id='db103c81-391e-4b81-b322-73999e2db468'></a>\n\n*Topics for Further Research*\n\n1.

PN formulations may contain more than 40 ingredients, including amino acids, dextrose, IVFE, electrolytes, vitamins, trace elements, insulin, and other medications. PN is considered a high-alert medication because significant patient harm may occur when this therapy is used in error.<sup>1,2</sup> A critical step in the PN process is a pharmacist's review and verification of PN orders. Breaches in the review and verification processes have resulted in errors and patient harm.<sup>1</sup> Healthcare organizations have the opportunity to improve the safety of PN therapy by optimizing technology for prescribing PN and transmitting PN order information as well as standardizing the PN review and verification processes.\n\n<a id='4337cfc4-ad4b-4ef2-a1a1-f0ed0891ff00'></a>\n\nQuestion: Verification 1 (V1)\n\n(V1) What are the essential components or attributes for safely transmitting PN orders to pharmacists for review and verification?\n\n<a id='b7fbb2fa-2499-45c0-86e9-60f92efed74c'></a>\n\n*Recommendations*\n\n1. PN should be prescribed using a CPOE system that is fully integrated with an automated compounding device (ACD). \"Fully integrated\" is described to mean that the order entered into the CPOE system is trans-mitted electronically to the ACD without requiring reentry of any data and any modifications to an order are electronically transmitted back to the CPOE system for physician approval and signature.\n2. When PN formulations are outsourced to a third-party vendor for compounding, PN orders should be pre-scribed using a CPOE system and electronically trans-mitted to the vendor to avoid transcription errors.\n3. In the absence of a fully integrated system, PN should be prescribed using a standardized order template as an\n\n<a id='b6a21263-06a0-464e-a619-3aa16b9e5d1b'></a>\n\nCAPTION ERROR\n\n<a id='47eddc0b-d1eb-4841-b7d1-60d314c5eb5a'></a>\n\nJournal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition 38(3)\n\n<a id='c0a84cc6-b318-4dcc-b506-a86821ed1408'></a>\n\neditable electronic document in order to avoid hand-written orders.\n4. Verbal and telephone orders for PN should be avoided except for pharmacist to prescriber communication to modify or clarify the order.\n5. PN order data should be in a standardized format, including standardized sequence of ingredients, standard units, standard formulas, and formulation options¹ as described above in the Questions (P1–P2).\n6. If transcription into the ACD is required, the output of the PN order data should be formatted to support direct entry into the ACD without requiring reordering of the ingredients, manual calculations of amounts, or unit-of-measure conversions.\n7. Data should only be manually transcribed from the PN order into the ACD when absolutely necessary. Transcribed data should always be double-checked by independent processes to monitor accuracy.⁴ Multiple manual transcriptions of PN order data should be avoided.\n8. PN orders should be prescribed, transmitted, and compounded when supported by properly trained personnel who regularly perform this task.⁵ This is usually during the daytime hours.\n9. Vendors and application architects for CPOE systems should place priority on developing pathways for prescribing PN that support the prescriber with appropriate clinical decision support (as previously described), enforce standards of practice, and communicate directly with ACDs.\n10. Application vendors and application architects for CPOE systems should collaborate with ACD manufacturers to develop fully integrated systems.\n11. Application vendors and application architects for CPOE systems should collaborate with ACD manufacturers and outsourcing pharmacies to develop fully integrated systems.\n\n<a id='7ec82a47-04ae-4604-ba95-dd5eb1cee699'></a>\n\n# Rationale\n\nFew healthcare organizations currently use a CPOE system for prescribing PN formulations that is fully integrated with an ACD. While some healthcare organizations use a CPOE system for prescribing PN, the majority continue to use paper order forms to prescribe PN, including handwritten orders.⁶⁻⁸\n\nOutsourcing pharmacies receive PN data in a variety of formats, including handwritten forms, which are commonly transmitted to the pharmacy. This may necessitate unit-of-measure conversion calculations, data manipulation, and transcription, which may result in errors. Editable electronic documents allow prescribers to complete orders and avoid the risks associated with handwritten orders.⁹,¹⁰ The lack of integration of the PN order with an ACD requires the manual entry of PN order data, which may lead to transcription errors.¹¹ A recent survey of PN practices reported that more than half of PN orders are\n\n<a id='46729a98-8cf8-4881-857e-a6c63039c8bd'></a>\n\ntranscribed by a pharmacist from handwritten orders or a printed label or requisition.⁸ Two recent reports from the ISMP describe transcription errors. One was the death of a 6-week-old infant who received a dose of sodium 60 times the prescribed amount.¹² The second report describes a PN order data entry error in which nutrients were entered into an incorrect PN template, resulting in a patient receiving a hypotonic PN formulation.³ Sacks et al also described a PN system in which PN order data were transcribed from a handwritten order into a hospital pharmacy computer and then reentered into the ACD, thereby increasing the risk for transcription errors.¹¹ If the PN process requires transcriptions, limiting the number of times data are entered from one system to another will decrease the risk of data entry errors. PN errors associated with incorrect calculations or converting units of measure have been reported and may result in patient harm. The ISMP reported the death of a neonate who received PN that included zinc at a dose 1000 times the prescribed amount. This error was the result of a calculation error in converting mcg/100 mL to mcg/kg/d.⁵\n\n<a id='66b9f2c9-99e8-4514-9310-04b19ddf0bd3'></a>\n\nThere are numerous CPOE vendors but few offer templates for prescribing PN that are user-friendly, allow institution-spe-cific customization, or interface with an ACD. Although the number of orders for PN is a small percentage of the total num-ber of medications prescribed, it is one of the most complex and complicated therapies provided by pharmacies. A CPOE system that is fully integrated with an ACD improves the safety of the PN process.3\n\n<a id='797ba0f2-f559-4202-8308-a85486faa818'></a>\n\nQuestion: Verification 2 (V2)\n\n(V2) What improvements in the PN review and verification\nprocesses will enhance the safety of PN therapy?\n\n<a id='8d5967af-7db3-4ade-b58d-3fc5f308d9ea'></a>\n\nRecommendations\n\n1. Healthcare organizations shall have a written policy and procedure for pharmacists to review and verify PN orders.\n2. The review and verification of PN orders should be conducted in an environment without distractions.\n3. PN orders shall be reviewed by a knowledgeable and skilled pharmacist to assess that the order is clear and complete.\n4. The PN order shall include the following elements:\n   a. Complete patient identifiers (patient name, medical record number or other unique identifiers, patient location)\n   b. Birth date and/or age\n   c. Allergies and associated reactions\n   d. Height and dosing weight in metric units\n   e. Diagnosis/diagnoses\n   f. Indication(s) for PN\n   g. Administration route/vascular access device (peripheral vs central)\n   h.

Date and time order submitted\nj. Administration date and time\nk. Volume and infusion rate\nl. Infusion schedule (continuous or cyclic)\nm. Type of formulation (dextrose/amino acids with separate infusion of IVFE or total nutrient admixture)\nn. All PN ingredients shall be ordered as follows:\n\n   1. Ingredients ordered as amounts per day (for adult patients) or amounts per kilogram per day (for pediatric and neonatal patients) rather than in amounts per liter, percent concentration, or volume.¹ \"Amount per day\" refers to macronutrients in grams per day and micronutrients in mEq, mmol, mcg, or mg per day.\n   2. Electrolytes shall be ordered as the complete salt form rather than the individual ion.\n   3. The PN order should contain the full generic name for each ingredient.¹,¹³ Brand names should only be used when multiple products exist and/or when the brand name may assist in identifying unique properties of the specific dosage form (eg, inherent electrolytes in amino acid formulations, fatty acids in IVFE).¹,¹³\n   4. All abbreviations shall follow The Joint Commission standards on abbreviations.¹³,¹⁴ Abbreviations on the ISMP's list of error-prone abbreviations, symbols, and dose designations shall not be used.¹⁵\no. A dose for each macronutrient\np. A dose for each electrolyte\nq. A dose for vitamins, including multivitamins and/or individual vitamin entities. Multivitamins shall be included daily in PN formulations¹,¹⁶\nr. A dose for trace elements, including multicomponents and/or individual trace element entities\ns. A dose for each non-nutrient medication (eg, insulin)\n\nPN orders shall undergo a clinical review to assess appropriateness and shall include the following elements:\na. Indication is consistent with published guidelines.\nb. Calculated osmolarity of the PN formulation is appropriate for the route of administration/vascular access device (peripheral vs central).¹\nc. Each additive macronutrient, micronutrient, non-nutrient medication (eg, insulin) is evaluated to confirm that the dose is clinically appropriate for the patient's nutrition needs, metabolic status, organ function, allergies, concomitant interventions, and other indices, and to confirm that the\n\n<a id='28672d7a-04a8-4071-8cd4-24fa9b9738d5'></a>\n\ndose is consistent with institutional practice stan-dards.\nd. The formulation is compared with the previous day's PN formulation, if any, to assess for substan-tial additions, deletions, increases, or decreases in dosages of macronutrients, micronutrients, or medications (eg, insulin).\ne. When laboratory data are available, updated lab-oratory values that have been reported since the order was submitted should be reviewed for sig-nificant changes and, if present, the appropriate-ness of additive dosing should be reevaluated.\n6. PN orders shall undergo a formulation safety review that includes the following elements:\na. All ingredients are evaluated for compatibility with each other. Calcium-phosphate precipitation risk should be assessed according to institutional policies and procedures.\nb. PN formulation is evaluated for expected stabil-ity from the time of preparation until the time that administration of the PN is complete. For exam-ple, emulsion stability of a total nutrient admix-ture should be evaluated.\n7. Healthcare organizations shall develop policies and/or protocols to clarify PN orders when doses are outside normal ranges or potential incompatibilities may exist (eg, adjusting calcium and phosphate doses to avoid the risk of calcium-phosphate precipitation, adjusting the IVFE dose when it is not expected to be stable as a TNA [ordering IVFE separately or adjusting IVFE dosage such that the daily dose achieves minimum concentration for stability]).\n8. Modifications to the prescriber's original PN order shall be communicated to the licensed prescriber (or their designee) and documented in the patient's medi-cal record in a manner that is auditable.\n9. All PN orders that require transcription of order data should undergo an independent double-check⁴ process prior to compounding the PN formulation. The double-check shall be documented and auditable.\n10. All PN orders requiring calculations or conversion of units of measure should undergo an independent dou-ble-check⁴ process prior to compounding the PN for-mulation. All double-checks shall be documented and auditable.\n11. Recommendations for pharmacy review of PN orders apply whether the pharmacist reviewing the PN order is on site or at a remote location from the prescriber. The time dedicated for the pharmacist(s) to review PN orders should be based on the average number of PN orders and the estimated time to review, clarify, and/or modify a PN order at an organization.\n\n<a id='c01baaee-813e-4914-ab06-502c0983cefa'></a>\n\n5.\n\n<a id='0c5b9052-b11d-4200-84d7-b3bb64c108a7'></a>\n\nCAPTION ERROR\n\n<a id='0bc1cdb9-36ea-4ca2-832a-eae6687479cc'></a>\n\nCAPTION ERROR\n\n<a id='2ad7b3a1-8c5a-4204-9801-fc76f4cb26b6'></a>\n\n12. PN orders that are completed in a hospital but outsourced to a third-party pharmacy for compounding and PN orders submitted to home infusion pharmacies should undergo the same standardized pharmacy review and verification process prior to transmission to the pharmacy for compounding.\n13. Institutions shall create a home PN order process that provides a safe plan for multiple days of therapy. The prescription for home PN therapy should be written in a format that specifically reflects trends in laboratory values and previous days of PN therapy. An institutional daily PN order format should not be used as a home PN prescription.\n14. Pharmacies have the same responsibility of maintaining the PN orders in their records as with other medication orders.\n15. The healthcare organization shall develop criteria to evaluate and identify pharmacists who are competent to review and verify PN orders.\n    a. Pharmacists responsible for the review and verification of PN orders should have completed specialty residency training and/or be certified as a Board Certified Nutrition Support Pharmacist (BCNSP) by the Board of Pharmacy Specialties (BPS).\n    b. In the absence of pharmacists with specialty residency training or BCNSP certification, the organization should have methods to identify and evaluate pharmacists competent to review and verify PN orders such as the certification program offered by the National Board of Nutrition Support Certification (NBNSC) until such time that a pharmacist with specialty residency training or BCNSP certification is available.\n    c. In the absence of pharmacists with specialty residency training or BCNSP certification, the organization should provide formal training programs or an opportunity to participate in formal training programs to increase knowledge and skills in nutrition support and with a goal of becoming certified in nutrition support. Training should focus on evaluating dosage of macronutrients and micronutrients as well as prescribing non-nutrient medications (eg, insulin) and their compatibilities and stabilities in PN.\n16. Pharmacists who review and verify PN orders should demonstrate competency at least annually.\n17. Quality improvement programs should be in place to report, track, and analyze errors associated with the PN order review and verification process.\n\n<a id='3e4a4e71-2a1b-4f83-a17e-f1dda40001ca'></a>\n\nRationale\nThe review of medication orders, including PN orders, involves many steps in which the pharmacist evaluates the order for\n\n<a id='39459399-23df-43af-90d5-a2a26a5da652'></a>\n\nsafety, efficacy, and appropriateness. These processes require\nknowledge of PN therapy and formulations; critical thinking\nand decision making by the pharmacist is crucial, and appropri-\nate allotment of time is necessary. 2,17 Before any PN formula-\ntion is compounded, the PN order is reviewed and verified.\nStandardizing these processes satisfies that all elements are\nincluded and the order is complete. The review and verification\nof PN orders includes both a clinical review and a pharmaceuti-\ncal review. The verification is conducted to check that the PN\norder is complete and that the appropriate vascular access is in\nplace for new patients beginning PN.2 Additionally, the clinical\nreview evaluates the appropriateness of the dose of each macro-\nnutrient and micronutrient as well as non-nutrient medications\nin the PN formulation. A pharmaceutical review of PN orders is\nalso conducted to determine if the prescribed components are\ncompatible and if the PN formulation is expected to be stable.2\n\n<a id='189501c6-22af-40b9-b663-4534da10bf6b'></a>\n\nA recent survey of PN practices reported that most institu-\ntions (60.2%) dedicate 0.6 full-time equivalent or more phar-\nmacists to verify and review PN orders. However, 23.1% did\nnot have any dedicated pharmacist time for these tasks. When\na pharmacist is involved, most conduct both a clinical and\npharmaceutical review of PN orders. The 2012 survey by the\nAmerican Society of Health-System Pharmacists of pharmacy\npractice in hospitals reports that 11.1% of hospital pharmacies\nhave pharmacists responsible for monitoring patients receiving\nPN therapy. 18\n\n<a id='69bf1bf0-164e-42cb-9116-71037538fff8'></a>\n\nThe complexity of PN orders necessitates special knowl-\nedge and skills to adequately review PN orders. Special train-\ning programs focusing on all aspects of the review process,\nespecially the total daily dose of PN components, will improve\nthe review process and heighten the pharmacist's awareness\nand ability to identify errors. ¹² Identification of errors in turn\nrequires follow-up and/or clarification with the prescriber. In\nthe recent survey of PN practices conducted by Boullata et al,\nthe reasons for PN order clarification included illegible orders,\ndoses outside normal ranges, incompatible additives, and\nincorrect PN volume or infusion rate. ⁸ Errors and patient harm\nhave also occurred when pharmacists misinterpreted informa-\ntion on the PN label when patients transferred from one health-\ncare setting to another (eg, home to hospital).¹ Failure to follow\nand be judicious with the verification and review processes\nhave resulted in adverse events. ¹,³,⁵,¹² Certification in nutrition\nsupport validates an individual's qualifications and level of\nknowledge to practice in this area.¹⁹ BPS criteria for recogni-\ntion states that the area of specialization shall be one for which\nspecifically trained practitioners are needed to fulfill the\nresponsibilities of the pharmacy profession in improving the\nhealth and welfare of the public, which are responsibilities that\nmay not otherwise be fulfilled effectively. Nutrition support\npharmacy practice fulfills that criteria. ¹⁹ In one paper, staff\nobtained certification in nutrition support and targeted indi-\nviduals with specialty certification when recruiting for new\nstaff. This resulted in a substantial increase in knowledge and\nability of pharmacists to manage the associated complexities of\nPN.\n²⁰\n\n<a id='bb352f66-5af9-4fe1-97f6-3ee4cb203846'></a>\n\nAyers et al\n\n<a id='58ff59be-1510-4d6c-ad3a-19d64e6bc6b9'></a>\n\n309\n\n<a id='00643b92-ea69-462e-b967-90c46b0e786a'></a>\n\n(V3) What are the steps healthcare organizations can take to improve the PN label and labeling system?\n\nRecommendations\n\n1.  Healthcare organizations shall have a policy and pro-cedure/protocol for standardized labeling of PN formulations.\n2.  Elements of the PN label include¹: (see Figure 3 and Figure 4)\n    a.  Two patient identifiers (eg, name, medical record number, date of birth)\n    b.  Patient location or address\n    c.  Dosing weight in metric units\n    d.  Administration date and time\n    e.  Beyond-use date and time\n    f.  Route of administration (central vs peripheral vas-cular access)\n    g.  Prescribed volume and overfill volume\n    h.  Infusion rate expressed in mL/h\n    i.  Duration of the infusion (continuous vs cyclic)\n    j.  Size of in-line filter (1.2 or 0.22 micron)\n    k.  Complete name of all ingredients\n    l.  Barcode\n    m.  All ingredients shall be listed in the same sequence and same units of measure as PN order.\n        *   All PN ingredients shall be ordered in amounts per day (for adult patients) or amounts per kilogram per day (for pediatric and neonatal patients) rather than in amounts per liter, per-cent concentration, or volume. \"Amount per day\" refers to macronutrients in grams per day and micronutrients in mEq, mmol, mcg, or mg per day.\n        *   Electrolytes shall be ordered as the complete salt form rather than the individual ion. Each individual macronutrient and micronutrient ordered shall be listed with its corresponding dose.\n        *   For home or alternative site PN labels, a list of patient/caregiver additives shall be included; these additives shall be easily identified and differentiated from the other PN components. Techniques to identify patient additives include highlighting or an asterisk to identify the addi-tives that are added just prior to administration.\n3.  Name of institution or pharmacy\n4.  Institution or pharmacy contact information, including\n\n<a id='0503113a-1963-49af-8efe-1a57fd0e7264'></a>\n\n5. Auxiliary labels may be used to express individual electrolytes as mEq and the phosphorus content as mmol per day. The label may also include information on the amount of energy provided by each macronutrient or electrolytes intrinsic to the amino acids product.\n6. If IVFEs are infused separately (vs TNA), the essential elements of the IVFE label are: (see Figure 5 and Figure 6)\n   a. Two patient identifiers (name, medical record number, date of birth)\n   b. Patient location or address\n   c. Dosing weight\n   d. Administration date and time\n   e. Route of administration (central vs peripheral access)\n   f. Prescribed amount of IVFE and volume required to deliver that amount\n   g. Infusion rate expressed in mL/h\n   h. Duration of the infusion (not longer than 12 hours)\n   i. Complete name of the IVFE, even though label placed on original manufacturer container\n   j. Beyond-use date and time\n   k. Name of institution or pharmacy\n   l. Institution or pharmacy telephone number\n7. Labels for home PN formulations should be consistent with USP General Chapter <17>.21 (See Figure 7)\n   a. Organize the prescription label in a patient-centered manner.\n     * Organized in a manner that best reflects how most patients seek out and understand medical information\n     * Includes only the most important patient information needed for safe and effective understanding\n   b. Emphasize instructions and other information important to the patient.\n     * Prominently display information that is critical for patient's safe and effective use of therapy\n     * At the top of the label, specify the patient's name, drug name (spelling out full generic and brand name), and strength/dose. Include explicitly clear directions for use in simple language\n     * Directions should follow a standard format so the patient can expect that each element will be in the same regimented order each time the medication is received\n   c. Simplify language\n     * Language on the label should be clear, simplified, concise, and familiar, and should be used in a standardized manner. Only common terms and sentences should be used.\n\n<a id='d7ec8588-d311-4960-a2e9-84700b07c84c'></a>\n\n*Question: Verification 3 (V3)*\n\n<a id='b6464c9c-a53f-4af3-b45d-3af707244268'></a>\n\ntelephone number\n\n<a id='7b832308-9d61-41e0-85f9-7446588bc172'></a>\n\nCAPTION ERROR\n\n<a id='4d35d23e-35ac-4eae-90c1-4223369fe9c7'></a>\n\nCAPTION ERROR\n\n<a id='2ccaaeed-96d8-487d-b29a-ceb8b8cfcacf'></a>\n\n* Use simplified, standardized sentences that have been developed to promote ease of understanding the instructions correctly.\nd.

The pharmacy-generated label is a critical tool used to compare the PN ingredients and administration information against the PN order. Standardized pharmacy labels for PN formulations provide information in a clear, uniform, and organized manner, and improves the verification processes for pharmacists.¹ Additionally, the label serves as a final check for those administering the PN, including nurses or patients/caregivers.¹²,¹³ Listing ingredients in a uniform sequence and units of measure removes the need for calculations and reduces the risk of misinterpretation. The misinterpretation of a PN label resulted in a child receiving an overdose of iron dextran and experiencing subsequent liver toxicity from iron overload.²² The lack of standardization has created confusion, especially when patients are transferred from one healthcare environment to another.²³\n\n<a id='4cc91fc2-e783-4159-9da1-3263aa9bd14d'></a>\n\nQuestion: Verification 4 (V4)\n\n(V4) What processes can healthcare organizations implement to improve the safety of PN therapy during shortages of PN components?\n\n<a id='04ccbfd0-6400-4353-b56f-ce369299f862'></a>\n\n_Recommendations_\n\n1.

The prescribing step is affected as prescribers find\nit difficult to keep up with shortages, alternative products,\nrationing, restrictions, and so on. Furthermore, the prescribing\nprocess is constantly changing, and prescribers may use work-\narounds to circumvent safety checks. Lastly, an increase in the\nnumber of prescribing errors has been associated with\nshortages. 30,31\n\n<a id='ea0fc6c0-f0d2-498a-a733-6be49e69c515'></a>\n\nMany of the same safety concerns have been identified in the PN order review step.

As with other aspects of the PN process, those\nresponsible for compounding and dispensing find it difficult\nand stressful trying to keep up with the many shortages. During\na shortage, alternative products that are unfamiliar or are simi-\nlar in appearance to other products may be substituted. This\nmay lead to errors. Furthermore, PN may be compounded\nusing alternative products such as calcium chloride or magne-\nsium chloride, for which there are insufficient stability and\ncompatibility data or known unfavorable differences. Frequent\nchanges in PN products or the size of the source containers\nnecessitate a change in the configuration of ACD, increasing\nthe potential for error. Some products cannot be configured for\nthe ACD, requiring a manual addition to a PN formulation.\nFrequent changes in products, alternative products, ordering\nprocess, and ACD configuration may result in PN orders and\nPN bag labels that do not match. This creates significant con-\ncerns for those responsible for the administration of the PN\nadmixture.\n\n<a id='c3ff924f-4c8e-457e-92c4-bd85fd0b0449'></a>\n\nThe PN product shortages affect the administration of PN whether administered by a nurse, patient, or caregiver. Just like others involved in the PN process, it is difficult and stressful to keep current with the shortages. As noted above, the PN order and PN bag labels may not match as the result of changes in the compounding process. With some shortages, patients may require supplemental electrolyte or mineral infusions when the alternative product cannot be added to the PN formulation due to stability or compatibility concerns. Increasing the number of times the patient's intravascular device is accessed may increase the risk of catheter-related bloodstream infections.<sup>30</sup> A recent study of PN practices reported the consequences of PN product shortages. Of the pharmacists responding, more than two-thirds reported that valuable time is consumed in developing contingencies. Additionally, 70.3% of respondents indicated that shortages interfere with the ability to meet patients' micronutrient needs, and almost half reported that shortages interfere with ability to meet macronutrient needs.<sup>8</sup>\n\n<a id='5f0c9500-536e-4bd2-bda6-2d1972a1ca50'></a>\n\nThe lack of a PN component increases the risk of a defi-\nciency of that nutrient or complications.

Additionally, a lack of competency-based educational curriculum in schools of pharmacy or pharmacy technician training programs may contribute to PN errors. Very few suitable studies exist that characterize the formalized training of pharmacy students or technicians in the preparation of sterile products and admixtures. Available data suggest that when pharmacy students are formally taught aseptic technique skills with direct observation and assessment of parenteral compounding procedures, microbial contamination rates related to medium-risk level compounding (eg, PN compounding) decreased significantly from baseline toward the end of the 16-week course.¹ Several recommendations pertaining to the knowledge and competency of staff involved in the preparation of compounded sterile products were developed at the recent ISMP Sterile Preparation Compounding Safety Summit.² Surveys of pharmacists at the beginning of postgraduate training programs demonstrated that first-year pharmacy residents reported minimal experience (median = 2) on a scale from 1 to 5 (5, most experience and 1, no experience) with PN evaluations and IV admixtures. This suggests that there are educational deficits in current pharmacist training related to areas important for institutional or homecare pharmacy practice.³ Observational data from practicing hospital pharmacists and pharmacy technicians revealed that compounding error rates were 37% when PN formulations were manually compounded and 22% when prepared with an ACD. Errors included touch contamination, incorrect calculations performed by technicians, and bypassing the built-in safety check systems on ACDs.⁴\n\n<a id='b8264a83-a5ad-4f9c-ba98-6962a7a9de6a'></a>\n\nQuestion: Compounding 1–2 (C1–C2)\n\n(C1) What compounding errors have been caused by deficits in knowledge, lack of training, competency, and proficiency?\n(C2) What compounding errors have been caused by a lack of standardized educational curriculum in schools of pharmacy or pharmacy technician programs?\n\n<a id='f5ea1398-9326-4459-8a83-4a0a8b10f7d7'></a>\n\n## Recommendations\n\n1. Schools of pharmacy in the United States shall develop curricula that address proper aseptic technique and USP Chapter <797> for making compounded sterile preparations (CSPs).\n2. Pharmacy technicians shall be certified by the Pharmacy Technician Certification Board if they are involved in the making of CSPs, including PN.\n3. Healthcare organizations shall provide a broad orienta- tion with an in-depth training program focusing on CSPs for all staff members supervising or participating in the\n\n<a id='41a3b32f-a1b6-410f-99e5-8b8aaefbb8b7'></a>\n\npreparation process. An ongoing competency assessment program shall be included in the training as well.\n\n4. Healthcare organizations shall require annual competency evaluations of pharmacists and pharmacy technicians involved in preparation of CSPs. This should include:\n   a. Calculations\n   b. Compounding base solutions\n   c. Preparing dilutions or aliquots\n   d. Aseptic technique manipulations\n   e. Using technology (ie, ACD) for preparation\n   f. Anticipating incompatibilities (calcium, phosphate)\n5. Organizations should develop a strategic plan for implementation of automation and technology for the sterile products service.\n6. Pharmacists and pharmacy technicians shall be proficient in the proper use of technology (ie, ACD) when used for preparation of CSPs.\n7. State Boards of Pharmacy should create a specific license and licensing requirements for infusion pharmacies and compounding pharmacies.\n8. State Boards of Pharmacy should provide an in-depth training program focusing on CSPs for all State Board inspectors. An ongoing competency assessment program should be included in the training as well.\n\n<a id='5fa0032b-9f23-4bda-ac05-0b92d92e725b'></a>\n\n# Rationale\nThe lack of standardized training emphasizing foundational concepts behind sterile compounding and aseptic technique is startling in today's professional programs educating both pharmacists and pharmacy technicians. Over the past 5 years, numerous reports of serious morbidity and mortality have appeared in the lay press due to a lack of training in aseptic technique with preparation of sterile products. The most recent tragic events have surrounded a rare outbreak of fungal meningitis that was traced to several lots of the injectable glucocorticoid methylprednisolone acetate compounded by the New England Compounding Center. Although these sterile injections were intended for back and joint pain, a lack of sterile compounding competency has sickened hundreds of patients and killed dozens. Even more relevant are the 9 deaths that occurred in Alabama during the preparation of amino acids under high-risk conditions and an error in sterile compounding technique. It is incumbent on pharmacists to check that all people involved in the oversight and preparation of CSPs obtain appropriate training and be evaluated on a regular basis through a competency assessment. Pharmacists would receive education in the physicochemical principles of pharmacy and practice experiences as part of a pharmacy school curriculum. Technicians would receive education in the operations of ACD hardware and software with varied practice experiences as part of the curriculum. Board certification for those involved in CSPs could guarantee a basic minimum requirement in lieu of\n\n<a id='6550dfe2-6d58-48f2-aeb6-cc72c74bc8ba'></a>\n\nCAPTION ERROR\n\n<a id='e8c53a59-4479-45f0-8bd8-6e165e30397a'></a>\n\n319\n\n<a id='b03a2cf9-a8f0-432a-9321-e23ca3b459b6'></a>\n\nformalized training as part of a curriculum. The criteria\nrequired for nutrition support pharmacy board certification\nwould suggest that these individuals are better prepared to\nallow fewer errors, although no data are available to support\nthis contention. Anecdotal data would suggest that pharmacists\nand pharmacy technicians with specific education and many\nhours of hands-on experience are in the best position to be\ninvolved with PN compounding. In the workplace, pharma-\ncists and technicians should participate in a comprehensive\norientation and training program with an ongoing competency\nassessment plan.² This plan would evaluate all aspects of ster-\nile compounding from calculations to the proper use of\ntechnology.\n\n<a id='9b522792-df5d-4ba5-b799-a565e9b5f4e7'></a>\n\nQuestion: Compounding 3 (C3)\n\n(C3) How can organizations avoid PN errors by implementing soft and hard limits on an ACD?\n\n<a id='7291804c-0fa1-4c88-8896-d5dc6553bf00'></a>\n\n## Recommendations\n\n1. Organizations shall implement specific computerized soft limits and hard (catastrophic) limits for PN ingredients based upon pharmacists' review that are consistent with the needs of their patient population.\n2. Access to the ACD database is limited to select individuals qualified to manage and maintain this activity and all changes are traceable. Pharmacists and technicians shall be educated on interpretation and limitations of calcium-phosphate compatibility curves in the software.\n3. Weight-based warning limits for doses shall be developed by clinicians with the assistance of the vendors. As an alternative, organizations may develop and use their own weight-based warning limits.\n4. Only pharmacists shall be allowed to override alerts. An independent double-check process should be completed by another pharmacy staff member, ideally another pharmacist.²\n5. Healthcare organizations should check that all unresolved ACD alerts encountered during the PN order entry process should be presented to the person reviewing the order entry so they can also view and respond to the alerts.\n6. Healthcare organizations shall reinforce the importance of reacting to the ACD alerts and documenting all interventions.\n7. Healthcare organizations should review available reports detailing the frequency of overrides as well as the frequency of overrides for specific PN components.\n\n<a id='b114888f-a9dd-4aff-9c69-c02fb24541e3'></a>\n\n*Rationale*\nLimits can be placed on the doses of each PN component to optimize safety within the compounding process. These limits\n\n<a id='2f1b27ef-862b-46f5-a0e4-2f54edc1fbbb'></a>\n\ncan be automated within the PN order-prescribing, reviewing,\nand/or compounding process. The term \"hard limits\" refers to\nalerts that indicate that a component is outside a determined\nsafe range and shall not be exceeded; these are also referred to\nas \"catastrophic\" given patient outcomes if exceeded.² \"Soft\nlimits\" refer to alerts that indicate an unusual dose that requires\nfurther evaluation. Once addressed, any alert that is overridden\nor any dosing that is revised will require documentation of the\nrationale. Compared with manual methods, the software appli-\ncation available with ACDs should lead to improved com-\npounding accuracy, enforcement of proper compounding\nsequence, and a reduction in opportunities for human touch\ncontamination. However, preparing PN admixtures with an\nACD is not an error-free process. Error rates in compounding\ncomplex preparations such as PN admixtures have been\nreported to be 22% when automated in part and 37% when\nmanually prepared.⁶ Organizations may improve the safety of\nusing PN compounding systems by requiring that all doses\nbeing compounded pass through an order entry/clinical deci-\nsion support system and by ensuring that those systems' clini-\ncal decision support features are properly enabled and\nconfigured. Transcription of PN order data from an order-cal-\nculating software package into a compounding device should\nbe avoided. In a recent survey on PN use, Boullata et al found\nthat dose limit warnings were active in only two-thirds of orga-\nnizations that used ACDs for preparing PN formulations.⁷\nISMP Medication Safety Alerts from 2007 and 2011 described\nincidents in which adverse outcomes resulted, in part, from the\nabsence of dose limit warnings.⁸,⁹ In both instances, infants\nreceived lethal doses of a micronutrient (zinc in one case,\nsodium in the other) when a manual order entry error was\neither not detected by the existing dose limits or dose limit\nalerts were not active. After reviewing the incidents, ISMP\nmade a number of safe practice recommendations. Among\nthese was the recommendation to install, test, and maximize\nautomated dose-limit warnings in the pharmacy computer sys-\ntem and the ACD order entry system, particularly for high-alert\nmedications such as PN and its ingredients. Further, ISMP rec-\nommends that each organization develop weight-based dosing\nlimits applicable to their patient populations, as ACD vendor-\nestablished \"catastrophic\" limits may still allow entry of a\npotentially fatal dose into the software without issuing a\nwarning.⁸,⁹\n\n<a id='ea215ea9-f57d-441c-8c28-df049b0ee758'></a>\n\nThe ASHP guidelines on the safe use of ACDs for the prep-aration of PN admixtures state that the pharmacy department should develop a monitoring and surveillance plan that pro-motes safe and efficacious use of the device at all times. 10 This plan should include a review of dose-limit alerts and overrides, utilizing the reporting capabilities of the ACD or pharmacy computer system.\n\n<a id='c980eeb8-3134-45c0-b84a-c79e9f508758'></a>\n\nDeBoer and Maddox described a review of smart pump data\nafter implementation throughout the Sanford USD Medical\nCenter.\" Three to six months of smart pump data were col-\nlected for each unit and an analysis of edit variance detail and\noverride variance detail was performed. After the initial review\n\n<a id='6505263f-63c3-4d14-bd30-f3770bd70527'></a>\n\nCAPTION ERROR\n\n<a id='32e3df0a-db07-4a08-89e2-e22eb58f6f26'></a>\n\nJournal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition 38(3)\n\n<a id='1bfbb9e4-37e2-4628-91c8-df52e3c383d3'></a>\n\nwas completed, data were analyzed for medications included\nin the ISMP high-alert medication list. Work practices were\nevaluated and revised with the goal of encouraging fewer edits\nand overrides. In a similar fashion, data from the ACD or phar-\nmacy computer system should be regularly reviewed in the\nassessment of trends and other long-term measures of\nperformance.\n\n<a id='ccbf2b09-d136-4c20-88dd-34448f56e35e'></a>\n\nQuestion: Compounding 4 (C4)\n\n(C4) What role does United States Pharmacopeia (USP)\nChapter <797> play in preventing PN errors?\n\n<a id='07b34551-2949-4231-a461-7ceb2674ca6d'></a>\n\nRecommendations\n\n1. Healthcare organizations shall comply with USP Chapter <797> standards.<sup>12</sup>\n2. Outsourcing should be considered as an alternative to in-house compounding when the healthcare organization does not possess the technological resources or staffing to prepare PN admixtures according to USP Chapter <797>. The decision to outsource should require that the pharmacy outsourcing PN production exercise due diligence to monitor that the outsourcer also operates within USP <797> guidelines.\n3. Standardized, commercially available PN products may be viable options to manually compounded sterile PN products when compliance with USP Chapter <797> and accepted guidelines from patient safety organizations is not feasible.\n4. Healthcare organizations shall have policies and procedures that address using multichamber, standardized, commercial PN products within their formulary.\n5. Healthcare organizations shall have well-defined policies and procedures that guide the preparation of PN admixtures.\n6. Healthcare organizations must identify standardized workflow processes that include quality control, process change control, and documentation practices. These standardized operating procedures should encompass the entire compounding process from order entry to verification of the final labeled product.\n7. Healthcare organizations should develop a strategic plan to include technology/automation for sterile compounding and consider using IV workflow software.<sup>2</sup>\n8. When an ACD is used to prepare PN admixtures, policies and procedures shall be developed that address performance requirements and responsibilities, control of the ACD in daily operations, safety and efficacy features, quality assurance monitoring and documentation, storage and inventory, education and training, and device variability and maintenance.\n9. Privileges to make changes in the ACD database shall be restricted to a limited number of pharmacy staff who are well trained in both the theory and the mechanics of this process.<sup>2</sup>\n\n<a id='ee595eeb-c4bb-4c3f-8cd8-0e351f747126'></a>\n\n10. Customized order entry templates created by organiza-tions should have a documented standard review pro-cess by qualified staff person that includes review and testing of the clinical decision support that is expected to alert the pharmacist to significant warnings. The use of a checklist or sign-off sheet shall be required and two staff members, including at least one pharmacist, shall sign off on or validate the template.²\n11. The additive sequence in compounding shall be opti-mized and validated as a safe and efficacious method. Manufacturers of ACDs shall provide an additive sequence that promotes the safety of the compounding device. This compounding sequence should be reviewed with the manufacturer of the PN products used by the organization.¹³\n12. The use of a checklist or signoff sheet shall be required when adding new products, including new and alterna-tive generics, changes in vial size or concentration, and when making other modifications to the ACD database (eg, changes in privileges, changes in data require-ments). Two staff members shall be required to sign off on or validate changes. (This process would not apply to inputting a new lot number for a product already in the database.)²\n13. Barcode verification shall be used to verify product identity during ACD setup and replacement of ingredients.²\n14. An independent double-check process for the initial daily ACD setup shall be performed by two staff mem-bers using a printed checklist. Verbal affirmation should take place to validate placement of all additives and base solutions, including name, concentration, and container size.² When the vendor of the compounding system describes a validated system for proper setup, that system should be followed.\n15. Tubing set(s) shall be traced from the source container to the port where it is attached during the initial daily ACD setup and with each change in the source container.²\n16. If multiple containers of a single additive are used dur-ing the preparation of a single CSP, all empty contain-ers shall be presented to the pharmacist and verified as part of the final check process prior to dispensing the final CSP.²\n17. When an ACD is used, it should deliver all ingredients. Manual compounding should only be used:\na. If the volume of a PN component to be mixed is less than the ACD can accurately deliver.\nb. If there is an interaction between a PN component and a component of the ACD (eg, insulin and tub-ing).\nc. If there is a chemical interaction between PN components that cannot be mitigated by sequenc-ing the addition of ingredients.\nd. During a shortage of a specific PN component, manual compounding can be a consideration as part of conservation efforts.\n\n<a id='5cb5a442-f846-4bb4-8e41-0a0c911ea2a7'></a>\n\nCAPTION ERROR\n\n<a id='31471719-1d1b-418e-bee7-9df10d4ebbf6'></a>\n\n321\n\n<a id='2b99dfa2-3397-484c-b783-e82c68c4f609'></a>\n\n18. Verification of manual additives should include inspection of the actual vials and syringes that contain the additives. Proxy methods of verification (eg, syringe pullback) shall not be used.²\n19. If the manual method is being used, the process should be standardized to promote safety and efficacy.¹³ The use of a checklist or sign-off sheet shall be incorporated into the manual process.\n20. PN orders should be prescribed, transmitted, and compounded when supported by properly trained personnel who regularly perform this task.⁹ This is usually during the daytime hours.\n21. In facilities that care for adult, pediatric, and neonatal patients, the preparation of CSPs for each population shall be separated by time or location. Separation strategies can include the use of different colored bins for assembling products to be prepared.²\n22. At least three verification processes should occur in the pharmacy: (1) after initial order entry of PN, (2) before manually injecting additives into the PN, and (3) once the PN has been compounded.⁹ In-process or end-product testing requires that the PN preparation be held pending results. It may be better to fully automate and validate the entire PN compounding process to prevent errors from being made in the first place.\n23. Organizations should develop a drug conservation policy that addresses the handling and disposition of PN components (while maintaining their integrity and sterility) that may be in short supply due to market conditions, as these shortages can affect workflow conditions.\n24. The physical environment in which PN compounding takes place should be assessed in terms of lighting, interruptions and distractions, sound and noise, ergonomics, and medication safety zone. USP General Chapter <1066> describes optimal physical environment standards that promote safe medication use throughout the medication-use process.¹⁴ Any deficiencies should be addressed following organizational chain of command.\n25. Once a standardized process for compounding PN has been implemented, organizations should review and revise the process on an annual basis along with a review of personnel compounding behavior.\n26. Operation of the compounding process must be routinely observed for procedural compliance and corrective action must be taken immediately if noncompliance is observed.\n\n<a id='0ec1be9c-e4ee-4dce-91a7-e17a6d0194e6'></a>\n\nRationale\n\nAn ASHP national survey of pharmacy practice in hospital set-\ntings published in 2012 found that overall, 65% of hospital\n\n<a id='cf1cc040-bbfd-4f69-9ce8-1d17ec0e135a'></a>\n\npharmacy departments reported having a United States Pharmacopeia (USP) Chapter <797> compliant cleanroom. 15 Having a USP Chapter <797> compliant cleanroom differed significantly by hospital size, with more than 87.5% of the largest hospitals (600 or more staffed beds) having a compliant cleanroom, compared with 48.1% of hospital pharmacy departments in hospitals with fewer than 50 beds. Commercially available PN multichamber bags were used by 36% of hospitals as the predominant form of PN formulation. ACDs were used by 20.4% of hospitals, followed by gravity methods (17.4%) and outsourcing compounding activities (14.6%); 11.6% of hospitals did not prepare PN formulations. The method of preparing PN differed significantly by hospital size. Larger hospitals most commonly used ACDs or outsourced preparations. Hospitals with fewer than 50 staffed beds most commonly used commercially available dextrose/amino acid formulations or TNA did not prepare any PN admixtures or used gravity methods to prepare PN. 15\n\n<a id='12288811-2c9e-477a-9c33-efc57e1ba495'></a>\n\nOrganizations should refer to a number of available guide-lines and articles regarding standardization of the PN com-pounding process (see Table 2).

Pharmacy staff should be aware of all patients who are receiving PN and check if orders have not been received by the established deadline. PN ingredients considered to be very small volumes that staff manually prepare, check, and inject require verification, including inspection of the vials and syringes containing such additives. Verification of manual additives should include inspection of the actual vials and syringes that contain the additives. Proxy methods of verification such as the syringe pull-back method of verification should not be used in the preparation of PN and other high-alert CSPs and shall not be used without the presence of the actual original source containers (medication and diluent).²\n\n<a id='599a7047-fb50-49da-8a17-bfda2f943a2b'></a>\n\nCAPTION ERROR\n\n<a id='cf147b2b-0c1c-4123-8049-8565f245385a'></a>\n\nJournal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition 38(3)\n\n<a id='7af8acec-d004-4679-97ee-42665a98a113'></a>\n\nTable 2.

At least three verification processes should occur in the pharmacy: (1) after initial order entry of PN, (2) before manually injecting additives into the PN, and (3) once the PN has been compounded. Each step in the verification process should require a pharmacist to compare the actual prescriber's order to the printed labels, and the printed labels to the additives and final product, as appropriate. Verification of manual additives should include inspection of the actual vials and syringes that contain the additives. The final verification of the compounded PN should include a comprehensive review of the PN order, the label on the product and the compounding work label, and a visual inspection of the CSP. Quality control checks and verification of replacement components on the compounder either manually or via barcoding should also be required, as should an independent double-check of any calculations.\n\n9\n\n<a id='fa5f49a8-1555-4be3-b45b-1faec189f702'></a>\n\nPN multichamber bags, which are designed to reduce the risk for instability or precipitation, are available. These multi-chamber bags separate components of the PN formulation with a bar or seal until just prior to activation and administration. The contents of the chambers should be mixed and any additives introduced by pharmacy staff prior to dispensing the formulation. However, if these products are used in home care, patients and/or caregivers shall be provided with thorough training regarding the procedure for properly mixing the product before use. In addition, the containers should be accompanied by auxiliary labels alerting users to the need to mix the product prior to administration.\n\n<a id='a435920d-8fec-42c2-b20d-b116e2e0010f'></a>\n\nOrganizations should review and revise the PN compounding process on an annual basis. A number of analytical methods have been applied to another high-risk complex compounding process, such as the preparation of chemotherapy. Bonan et al describe a multidisciplinary team's application of the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points method to preparation of anticancer drugs. 20 The team identified 11 critical points. Monitoring, control measures, and corrective actions were identified for each risk. Over a 10-month period, 16,647 chemotherapy preparations were compounded with 1157 nonconformities for the 11 critical control points. These included 693 compounding sheet errors and 131 analytical nonconformities. Aboumatar et al reported the outcomes of application of Lean Sigma solutions to the chemotherapy preparation process. 21 Once mistake-proofing interventions were introduced via workspace redesign, process redesign, and developing standard operating procedures for pharmacy staff, reported medication errors reaching patients causing an increase in patient monitoring decreased and the number of reported near misses increased. These improvements would be welcomed in the PN use process.\n\n<a id='94c3d9ad-7194-457e-8684-95a64edf17b2'></a>\n\n*Topics for Further Research*\n1.

In addition, the broad range of healthcare settings in which PN administration takes place—from critical care to home care—raises the potential for disparities to exist in the technology, equipment, and knowledge and skills of the nursing staff and caregivers responsible for PN administration. Although once uncommon, PN is administered with increasing frequency in long-term care and skilled nursing facilities. Regardless of the setting or the number of patients receiving the therapy in a given facility, the classification of PN as a high-alert medication requires healthcare organizations to develop evidence-based policies and procedures designed to promote safe PN administration and to validate the competence of those responsible for delivering this complex form of IV therapy.\n\n<a id='c6399134-d149-47ec-afce-b46df3ef5d74'></a>\n\nQuestion: Administration 1 (A1)\n\n(A1) What system-based measures can organizations implement to enhance the safety of PN administration?\n\n<a id='8e0c916a-9127-4a6d-94a6-4850764ac04e'></a>\n\n*Recommendations*\n\n1. Written policies and procedures shall be developed to standardize nursing practices for the administration of PN throughout the organization.\n2.

Healthcare organizations should conduct ongoing validation of competency in PN administration based on changes in practice related to PN administration, results of medication error monitoring, and/or the\n\n<a id='db42c5ca-8d1b-4ddc-9edd-72ed9957aa94'></a>\n\nCAPTION ERROR\n\n<a id='ae28efd5-2b5c-4bf2-8eca-7899f613b1d1'></a>\n\nJournal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition 38(3)\n\n<a id='d33b27bd-7086-44c6-8adf-afab28d0d178'></a>\n\nvulnerability of the patient population (eg, high acuity patients, including neonates and the critically ill).\n\n4. Healthcare organizations that provide nursing services related to home infusion shall establish mechanisms for periodic reassessment of knowledge and techniques used by patient or caregivers for home PN.\n5. Interdisciplinary quality improvement programs shall incorporate analysis of medication errors associated with PN administration and knowledge of errors that occur in other institutions.\n6. Safeguards shall be implemented to address specific problem areas as indicated by analysis of PN administration errors.\n7. An interdisciplinary process should be employed for selecting and evaluating equipment and technological aids, such as smart pumps and barcoding to reduce errors in PN administration.\n8. Healthcare organizations shall develop policies and procedures that address extravasation of PN formulations.\n9. Acute care facilities should establish a policy that prohibits the use of a PN formulation prepared for administration at home or in subacute or long-term care facilities.\n10. Protocols for safe operation of infusion pumps shall stipulate rules regarding alarm silencing, modification, and disabling.\n11. Healthcare organizations should purchase infusion pumps with capacity to reduce errors due to incorrect programming. Whenever possible, infusion pumps should be standardized throughout the organization.\n\n<a id='8369f774-f774-4700-82a1-d81404482789'></a>\n\nRationale\n\nData pertaining to the incidence of errors related to PN admin-\nistration are scarce. A recent survey revealed that 44% of orga-\nnizations do not track PN-related medication errors and do not\nknow where in the process errors may be occurring.¹ The lit-\nerature does provide some insight into the scope of the prob-\nlem. In particular, the frequency with which case reports of\nPN-related errors involve neonatal and pediatric patients sug-\ngests that this population may be most vulnerable to PN admin-\nistration errors.²\n\n<a id='2e8e0168-0c0c-4a09-b961-e45d137b32d8'></a>\n\nOne prospective observational study of errors associated with PN found that 35% of PN-related errors occurred during the administration process.³ In a similar audit of 18,588 PN days in a tertiary pediatric hospital, administration-related errors accounted for 30% of all PN errors.⁴ In addition, data gathered over a 5-year period from a national medication error-reporting program revealed 266 errors associated with IVFE in neonatal intensive care units, 93.2% of which occurred in the administration phase.⁵,⁶ Another report of quality improvement data from a single 39-bed unit caring for neonates to young adults indicated that in one 6-month period, PN and IVFE errors accounted for 25% of all medication errors.⁷\n\n<a id='892925db-59b0-460d-bb0d-046a539ae20d'></a>\n\nStandardized Procedures and Competency Validation. Failure to follow established procedures plays a prominent role in PN administration errors. While human factors frequently contribute to PN errors, organizational efforts to strengthen the safety of PN administration must extend beyond a focus on individual performance and center on identifying system-based approaches to reduce errors.8,9 Fundamental to this process is the development and articulation of nursing policies and procedures for PN administration that standardize nursing practices based on published clinical guidelines.2,5,10 These policies and procedures shall be reviewed and revised on a regular basis. Table 3 provides an outline of essential components of nursing procedures for safe PN administration.\n\n<a id='93623948-102d-4b31-877d-76d86fce27dd'></a>\n\nHealthcare organizations, regardless of setting (acute care\nto home care), shall conduct ongoing education of nurses and\npatients or caregivers and establish mechanisms to validate\ncompetence in PN administration. At a minimum, competency\nvalidation should occur in the following circumstances: as part\nof orientation for newly hired nurses, when a change in proto-\ncol or procedure takes place, with the introduction of new\nequipment or technology, and when quality improvement mon-\nitoring or other data sources reveal a gap in skills or knowledge\nrelated to PN administration. \\textsuperscript{11} Home infusion nursing care\nproviders shall establish processes for periodic reassessment of\nknowledge and techniques used by patients or caregivers in the\ndelivery of PN in the home. \\textsuperscript{12} Studies of educational initiatives\naimed at reducing intravenous medication errors have not con-\nsistently produced the desired impact on error rates. \\textsuperscript{13} The opti-\nmal strategy (simulation, case scenarios, observation, etc) for\nproviding continuing education aimed at reducing medication\nerrors remains unclear, emphasizing the importance of using a\nvariety of educational strategies and maintaining vigilance in\nevaluating their effectiveness.\n\n<a id='e037b853-6491-4ca7-b25b-966032fdd1e2'></a>\n\nPolicies and procedures related to PN administration should address management of extravasation of PN formulations into perivascular or subcutaneous tissues. 14-18 Although most often associated with peripheral vein infusions, PN extravasation can occur with all types of vascular access devices (VADs). 11,17 A number of factors influence the extent of tissue damage, including pH, osmolarity, electrolyte content, and duration of tissue exposure. 17 No controlled trials are available for the management of PN extravasations, but consensus-based recommendations include stopping the infusion, aspiration of residual fluid, elevation of the limb, and application of cold therapy. 11,17 Treatment with hyaluronidase has also been described for extravasations of PN and hypertonic dextrose. 17,19 Education for nursing staff and nutrition support clinicians should include ongoing assessment of the vascular access site and appropriate interventions in the event of an extravasation.\n\n<a id='f1be5a7f-c4c2-4b45-b7ba-585f3bc2a7f1'></a>\n\nOrganizations must also develop policies pertaining to the administration of PN formulations brought in from home or from another facility. The inability to verify the stability and sterility of the formulation—as required by The Joint Commission standards—raises serious safety concerns. 20 The lack of medical and pharmacy review can potentially lead to\n\n<a id='1820d364-553a-4ea5-8d05-8ce631211f8e'></a>\n\nCAPTION ERROR\n\n<a id='3ba27aa5-fcd1-4d6c-99b4-a0692787a52e'></a>\n\nCAPTION ERROR\n\n<a id='1879cd57-a1b7-478c-af18-e5098bf92fe4'></a>\n\nTable 3.

Technological advances hold much prom-ise for improving the safety of PN administration. Yet only 33% of healthcare organizations report using CPOE for PN orders, while 20% employ barcode medication administration (BCMA).¹ Little evidence is available regarding the impact of these technological aids in reducing errors in the PN adminis-tration process. CPOE appears to offer benefits in preventing errors in the prescription and transmission phases rather than those associated with PN administration.²¹⁻²³ BCMA technol-ogy serves as an aid in verifying patient identity, but errors can\n\n<a id='518abc0f-8398-4a02-a03d-d7dcac7b3229'></a>\n\noccur when clinicians bypass the safety features of the system.\nComplex admixtures such as PN present challenges with\nBMCA systems because current technology cannot validate\nthat the label on a formulation containing multiple ingredients\naccurately reflects the contents of the PN container.\n\n<a id='6245fb64-35cb-4dee-b9a3-62a8ab668e1b'></a>\n\nInfusion pumps have long been seen as a requirement for PN administration.2,11 Yet despite their widespread use as a safety measure, pump-related mishaps stand out as a frequent factor in PN administration errors.4,6 At a minimum, infusion pumps should feature accurate volume (rate control), anti-free flow controls, and alarms for sensing air and pressure changes in the administration tubing, as well as dose error reduction software.11,24 Protocols for safe operation of infusion pumps shall stipulate rules regarding alarm silencing, modification, and disabling.\n\n<a id='1e476b6b-6140-46fc-86b5-bb41bba703a1'></a>\n\n326\n\n<a id='0ee0745d-095f-4199-8cb2-72bdba8fbeda'></a>\n\nJournal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition 38(3)\n\n<a id='a78af42b-d697-49a6-950c-53a0d0a239f8'></a>\n\nIn recent years, infusion pumps equipped with software designed to detect potential errors (\"smart pumps\") have become available, although conflicting information exists regarding the use of these devices. A recent gap analysis that specifically addressed current PN practices found that smart pumps are available in 29% of responding facilities.1 On the other hand, a survey of hospital-based pharmacies reported a usage rate of 77% for these devices.22 Smart pumps provide a safeguard against programming errors and capture data that can support quality improvement programs.25 When used properly, smart pumps reduce the potential for error, but this pump technology is not foolproof. If a smart pump drug library is bypassed or is used incorrectly or the infusion rate and volume are manually entered, a dose error can occur. One case study, for example, reported an incident in which a PN infusion was administered at 10 times the prescribed rate for 2 hours when a soft limit alert was bypassed.26 The advantages of smart pumps can be offset by the complexity of programming the pumps and maintaining a current drug library. To have a meaningful impact on patient safety, smart pumps must be integrated with BCMA and CPOE systems as well as hospital and pharmacy information systems.21 A comprehensive organizational commitment to the technology of smart pumps is essential to the successful deployment in clinical areas.25,27 Organizations should purchase infusion pumps with capacity to reduce errors due to incorrect programming. Whenever possible, infusion pumps should be standardized throughout the organization to promote user familiarity with the operation of the device.28\n\n<a id='8b9710be-dead-40e1-a661-bb3432ce9106'></a>\n\nQuality improvement. A critical step in efforts to improve the safety of PN is the implementation of quality improvement programs designed to track and analyze errors associated with PN administration.⁸ However, only 39.9% of organizations report having an ongoing quality improvement process for PN.¹ Proactive and reactive methodologies, failure mode effects analysis, root cause analysis, and the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) model should all serve as the framework for identifying high occurrence or high impact errors, closing practice gaps, and engendering continuous process improvement.²⁹,³⁰\nMultifaceted interdisciplinary approaches must foster a culture of safety, clarify problem areas, involve key stakeholders, test change strategies, and maintain channels of communication. These key concepts are most effective in bringing about and sustaining behavior change.²⁹\n\n<a id='169a7cff-b2f1-4b61-89d6-9684b322e15e'></a>\n\nAs noted earlier, smart pumps can serve as a valuable source of quality improvement data that allows organizations to track practices related to PN administration and identify interven-tions that address safety breaches.²⁵ However, without a reli-able wireless network, data retrieval can be labor intensive.²⁵,²⁷,³¹,³²\n\n<a id='8b6bff27-2490-4212-a943-7c1ceacdea59'></a>\n\nQuestion: Administration 2 (A2)\n\n(A2) What strategies can prevent errors in the verification\nphase of PN administration?\n\n<a id='8e639d0e-80d2-4f1b-bf32-a71c9c94789c'></a>\n\n## Recommendations\n\n1.  The verification process of PN administration should be presented in a bundle format, which uses a set of evidence-based interventions for a defined patient population or care setting.\n2.  Nurses, caregivers, and patients shall visually inspect the integrity of the PN container and formulation before spiking the container.\n3.  The PN label shall be verified against the original prescriber order. No verbal orders shall be accepted.\n    a. Check the patient identifiers, product name, route of administration (central vs peripheral), designated initiation time, infusion rate, and beyond-use date and time.\n    b. Match all components listed on the label of the formulation to the PN order.\n4.  A printed copy of the PN prescription shall be provided to home PN consumers initially and with each formulation change to allow this verification step.\n5.  Patient identity shall be confirmed using two identifiers according to organizational policy.\n6.  The administration tubing shall be traced to the point of origin in the body at the initiation of the infusion and at all handoffs.\n7.  An independent double-check process and verification of infusion pump settings should be performed by a second clinician before beginning the PN infusion and documented in the medical record.\n\n<a id='07df931d-6dbf-4c18-b911-a0662a9c8860'></a>\n\n## Rationale\n\nPN administration errors often stem from failure to adhere to the verification steps of PN administration, which parallel the \"five rights\" of medication safety that all nurses learn: right patient, right drug, right dose, right route, and right time.<sup>9,11</sup> Policies and procedures for PN administration should avoid broad directives to \"check the label\" but instead provide clear procedural guidance for each step in the verification process. This verification process should be presented in a bundle format, which uses a set of evidence-based interventions for a defined patient population or care setting. As with other bundles used in healthcare, all components of the verification process must be implemented together to achieve improvements in care.<sup>33</sup>\n\n<a id='dc45ad76-b4fe-43e9-b01e-85619feb2329'></a>\n\nAdherence to the \"five rights\" is not sufficient in preventing medication errors. Although human factors frequently contribute to errors, healthcare organizations have a responsibility to create an infrastructure that supports safe practice and reduces the potential for error.<sup>8,9</sup> This includes educating staff about the proper use and effectiveness of double-checks and creating procedures for reporting errors, near misses, and barriers to safe practice in a nonpunitive environment.<sup>8,9</sup>\n\n<a id='2895b8e8-4cd1-43f3-8b00-eec82464d809'></a>\n\nVerification procedures. PN formulations often resemble other products used in clinical care, such as bladder irrigation fluids,\n\n<a id='799b60d8-bc23-4233-afb9-eaa8950bd499'></a>\n\nAyers et al\n\n<a id='973243c7-6f0c-4e6a-93c3-3ac02366c49c'></a>\n\n327\n\n<a id='10ba385c-a435-4091-b0a1-0ca2661ee9dd'></a>\n\nenteral formula, human breast milk, and cardioplegia solu-\ntions, posing the risk for wrong-product or wrong-route errors.\nPractices related to the delivery and storage of these items can\nmitigate the likelihood of such errors, but the importance of the\nverification process as the final step before the point of patient\ncontact cannot be overstated.\n\n<a id='f775d15d-1c0e-463a-a3d2-5993f411607f'></a>\n\nNursing education for PN administration shall include infor-mation regarding management of potentially compromised or unstable PN formulations. This includes inspection of PN for-mulations prior to initiating the infusion and at regular intervals during the infusion. Any formulation that displays evidence of precipitants, particulate matter, or an unstable formulation shall be returned to the pharmacy for further investigation. 34\n\n<a id='b3c26dad-682b-4223-890f-568253b250f4'></a>\n\nOther examples of lapses in the verification process include PN administration to the wrong patient by the wrong route— infusing a central formulation via peripheral vein or through an incorrect tubing connection—or at the wrong rate.² The nurse or caregiver should be provided access to the complete original PN order to facilitate verification of all elements of the order (ie, patient identifiers, nutrient dosing, infusion rate, etc).¹\n\n<a id='f2ef7dfa-575b-4749-a1e0-58d37f42e8ad'></a>\n\nMistakes involving incorrect infusion rates are among the most common errors reported. Often, these errors are related to mistakes in programming a single infusion pump, but the risk for rate errors appears to increase when IVFE and dextrose/amino acid components are administered as separate infusions. 2,3,6 Errors involving incorrect infusion rates pose the greatest risk for patient harm due to the potential for causing life-threatening metabolic disturbances such as hyperglycemia or fat overload syndrome.\n\n<a id='dd6c55f5-58ae-48ef-91fe-2997d9c975eb'></a>\n\nTubing misconnections. Inadvertent catheter tubing misconnections have been recognized as a serious problem in healthcare. Although the administration of enteral feeding through intravenous devices has been associated with the most serious injuries, accidental connections between intravenous tubing and other systems that rely on Luer connectors have been reported, including epidural, intracranial, intrathecal, and tracheal tubing systems. 35,36 Because tubing used to administer PN must be changed every 24 hours, the potential for a misconnection occurs at more frequent intervals than with conventional intravenous fluids. Clear labeling on PN containers, tubing, and pump channels can reduce the risk of inadvertent misconnections. 32,37 However, the single most important risk reduction strategy is to trace all tubing back to its origin before connecting devices or infusions and to recheck connections and trace all patient tubes and catheters to their sources at the start of each shift and upon the patient's arrival to a new setting or unit as part of the hand-off process. 38,39\n\n<a id='ab124c84-5160-4430-9727-b614a4d0de34'></a>\n\n_Independent double-checks._ Reports of PN-related errors often recommend implementation of independent double-checks at critical phases of PN administration, such as order verification or programming the infusion rate into the\n\n<a id='4c9d7cf8-4c08-4f60-aad3-dfee2eda684d'></a>\n\npump. 2,3,6,7,32 To be effective, an independent double-check\nmust involve two clinicians separately checking the infusion\nsettings in accordance with the prescriber's order, alone and\napart from each other, then comparing results. 40 Although dou-\nble-checks serve as a valuable safety mechanism if performed\ncorrectly, the process may require up to 20 minutes of addi-\ntional nursing time. 40 Other barriers include a lack of clarity\nregarding the procedure for double-checking and a culture that\ndoes not fully support peer review. 41 Furthermore, excessive\nuse of double-checks can dilute the effectiveness of this safety\nmechanism. 40,42 Independent double-checks should not be\nimplemented to address problems that could be corrected\nthrough system redesign. 40 Nevertheless, organizations that\nhave identified errors in conjunction with a specific component\nof the PN verification process, such as order verification,\npatient identification, or pump programming, should imple-\nment double-checks strategically to avert potentially harmful\nerrors. For optimal effectiveness, independent double-checks\nshould be used in conjunction with other error reduction strate-\ngies and system changes aimed at reducing the risk of medica-\ntion errors. 40 The use of computer-generated checklists with\nPN infusion instructions has been suggested as a way to guide\nverification procedures without increasing workload demands,\nbut this approach requires further study. 5,43\n\n<a id='75448a7c-2152-4ea3-b91a-e6f730295ff6'></a>\n\nQuestion: Administration 3 (A3)\nWhat practices maintain patient safety during the infusion of\nPN?\n\n<a id='2c8e5cef-0da5-4184-ab5f-6cfe797342c2'></a>\n\nRecommendations\n\n1. PN shall be administered by or under the supervision of trained, competent personnel.\n2. Organizations shall establish evidence-based policies to guide the selection, insertion, care, and maintenance of VADs used to administer PN.\n3. PN protocols shall include measures to reduce contamination through manipulation of the catheter hub.\n4. VADs used for PN administration should not be used to obtain blood samples for laboratory tests unless no peripheral access is available.\n5. PN infusions shall be infused through a filter appropriate for the type of formulation.\n6. An occluded filter shall never be removed in response to occlusion alarms, thus allowing the unfiltered formulation to continue to infuse.\n7. Administration tubing should be attached to PN containers immediately prior to use.\n8. Administration tubing and filters shall be changed with each new PN container (every 24 hours for TNAs and dextrose/amino acid formulations; 12 hours for IVFE infused separately).\n\n<a id='06dd0884-0d0b-48dd-b581-25515f015a23'></a>\n\nCAPTION ERROR\n\n<a id='76af8b52-8396-4e34-9e5c-5b21030fbf65'></a>\n\nJournal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition 38(3)\n\n<a id='bd3c93ce-0594-41a0-beaa-af8eeb6d80ee'></a>\n\n9. For prolonged infusions of IVFE (20–24 hours), the daily dose should be divided into 2 parts, with a new container and tubing every 12 hours.\n10. Policies regarding PN multichamber bags should be developed using a multidisciplinary approach.\n11. The PN infusion shall be maintained at the prescribed rate:\n    a. Correct pump settings shall be verified at regular intervals and at each hand-off.\n    b. The PN infusion rate shall not be adjusted if the infusion is off schedule.\n    c. The rate of PN shall not be increased in response to changes in fluid needs; additional hydration should be provided as a separate infusion.\n    d. The PN should not be interrupted for routine care or patient transport for diagnostic studies.\n    e. Organizations shall develop policies regarding PN infusion and appropriate metabolic monitoring during surgery.\n12. The timing and frequency for blood glucose monitoring shall be based on clinical status and performed in a manner appropriate for the PN infusion schedule (cycled vs continuous).\n13. Caution shall be used when administering subcutaneous insulin coverage prior to a scheduled interruption of the PN infusion.\n14. In acute care acute settings (including long-term acute care), no additions should be made to PN formulations outside the compounding pharmacy; in home settings, additions to PN formulations should be limited in number and be made as close as possible to initiating the infusion.\n15. In long-term care facilities and in home care, education should be provided and caregiver competency regarding proper technique for the addition of prescribed additives to PN formulations should be verified.\n16. Co-infusion of medications through PN lines shall require a review of compatibility and stability data by a pharmacist.\n17. PN should be discontinued prior to transfer to another facility.\n18. The administration of PN and the patient's tolerance shall be documented in the medical record.\n\n<a id='b429767a-7b24-4703-80af-6473eb39edd0'></a>\n\n*Rationale*\n\nNursing care during PN infusion centers on administering the infusion as prescribed, preventing complications, monitoring metabolic stability, assessing progress toward therapeutic goals, and documenting patient response to therapy. This process includes safe and effective management of all medical devices and equipment used in the delivery of PN, safe administration of medications in conjunction with PN therapy, and optimal care of vascular access devices.\n\n<a id='39ba7b38-ae35-4eb6-b05e-9dceb43a1a4b'></a>\n\nMedical devices and equipment\n\nVascular access. Reliable vascular access is essential for safe and effective delivery of PN. A wide array of VADs are available, but some are better suited to PN delivery than others. Factors that influence the selection of a VAD for PN include the patient's medical condition, need for concomitant intravenous medication(s), the anticipated duration of PN therapy, and the setting in which PN is administered.\" In all care settings, the patient's views should also play a role in the decision-making process for VAD selection.\n\n<a id='61f265bb-0397-4483-b978-c306180179c3'></a>\n\nDespite their essential role in PN administration, VADs are a leading cause of serious adverse complications related to PN therapy, in particular, central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI). PN is an independent risk factor for CLABSI, requiring organizations to be especially vigilant in establishing policies to guide the selection, insertion, and care of these devices. 44 In recent years, widespread implementation of a bundle of evidence-based guidelines for insertion and maintenance of VADs has achieved substantial reductions in the CLABSI rates. 45 In addition to addressing VAD insertion and site care, PN protocols shall also include measures aimed at reducing contamination that occurs through manipulation of the catheter hub. Some organizations maintain policies requiring a dedicated line or lumen for PN administration, although studies have not yielded consistent results regarding the efficacy of this practice. 46\n\n<a id='359305e2-29c7-47fe-8035-0241160c3386'></a>\n\nMany organizational protocols for care of VADs discourage blood sampling from central lines as part of an overall effort to reduce manipulation and subsequent contamination of the catheter hub. For similar reasons, The Joint Commission has highlighted the use of VADs for blood sampling as a “practice to avoid.”47 One recent study of home PN recipients found an increased risk for CLABSI in patients who routinely had blood drawn from a VAD, leading these authors to conclude that PN catheters should not be used for obtaining blood samples unless no peripheral access is available.46 The elevated risk for CLABSI that is associated with PN administration warrants a multifaceted approach to CLABSI prevention that targets all pathways for VAD infection.\n\n<a id='174a8874-e67e-4eb8-9dff-06123ebcf717'></a>\n\nThe use of VADs for blood withdrawal not only increases the risk for microbial contamination of the line and hub, but samples drawn incorrectly from a VAD during PN infusion can also lead to spurious laboratory values. Binkley et al first drew attention to the danger of this phenomenon in a report of a 10-month quality assurance study.48 More recently, a year-long prospective cohort study in an academic medical center found 63 incidents of spurious blood work in 34 PN recipients.49 In both cases, investigators recount incidents of patient harm—typically hypoglycemia or hypokalemia—that resulted from unnecessary medical intervention for falsely elevated laboratory values.\n\n<a id='7aa0ea45-d191-46d2-8a1a-688e96462c3a'></a>\n\nFilters. In-line filters are required for PN administration to reduce the potential for patient harm due to particulates, micro-precipitates, microorganisms, and air emboli.⁵⁰ These devices\n\n<a id='8a142a8b-c4b0-4e70-b493-3a4f7d217fc5'></a>\n\nCAPTION ERROR\n\n<a id='43bd3d3b-e270-46af-8e74-10d41fb460bd'></a>\n\nCAPTION ERROR\n\n<a id='e62e205e-4789-40f3-9871-dfbcd86362f0'></a>\n\nshould be placed as close to the patient as possible on the admin-\nistration system. A 0.22-micron filter is recommended for a dex-\ntrose/amino acids formulation; a 1.2-micron filter is used for a\nTNA formulation. Because nurses must deal with the problem\nof pump alarms at the point of care, nursing competencies for\nPN administration shall include appropriate actions and trouble-\nshooting in response to high-pressure alarms or an occluded\nfilter. This education shall emphasize that a filter that becomes\noccluded during PN administration should raise suspicions that\nthe incorrect filter size has been used or that a precipitate or par-\nticulate is present in the formulation. When an occluded filter\ntriggers pump alarms, the PN infusion shall be stopped. Before\nresuming PN, a pharmacist should review the PN formulation to\ndetermine if incompatibility issues are the cause of the problem\nand to identify actions to prevent further occurrences.\n\n<a id='07bfdd94-4b63-45b4-8505-1b0ab42bd7c8'></a>\n\nFilters are manufactured for single patient use and should be changed according to the manufacturer's guidelines. The typical maximum use interval for PN filters is 24 hours. Due to the potential for contamination and subsequent release of endotoxin, filters should not be primed with PN fluid in advance—in the compounding pharmacy, for example. Instead, the filter should be filled with fluid immediately before initiating the infusion.\n\n<a id='5eb3c91d-5cd8-4ff9-9b64-bedd5b7a928f'></a>\n\nAdministration tubing and containers. PN formulations should be provided in a single daily bag, with the exception of IVFE that is administered as a separate infusion. The PN admixture should be kept refrigerated and protected from light exposure between the times it is dispensed until just before infusion. Exposure of PN formulations to ambient light generates peroxides and other degradation products, potentially contributing to oxidant stress. Concern regarding the clinical impact of this phenomenon has led to recommendations that PN be shielded from light, especially for neonates.⁵¹ However, studies have failed to demonstrate clear clinical benefits of shielding PN formulations from light. Partial light protection offers no clinical benefit. To reduce PN degradation, the container and tubing must be protected from light at all points from compounding through administration.⁵² Further research is required to determine if complete photoprotection of PN formulations can lead to improved clinical outcomes.\n\n<a id='12790dfb-91f9-4d2f-82a0-8f45a05244d3'></a>\n\nThe administration tubing should be attached to the PN\ncontainer, using sterile technique, immediately prior to initiat-\ning the infusion. Although there may be workflow advantages\nto spiking the container and priming tubing in advance, no\nstudies have examined the safety of this practice. Infection\ncontrol guidelines for non-nutrition intravenous fluids stipulate\nthat the infusion begin within 1 hour of inserting the tubing\nspike into the container. ⁵³ The issue of whether the risk of con-\ntamination could be reduced by spiking the PN container in an\nISO Class 5 environment or higher remains unknown.\n\n<a id='2c1c6210-4ea6-4011-aec4-aae61b41a156'></a>\n\nIVFE administered separately shall be appropriately labeled\nand administered in keeping with the organization's policies\nand procedures for minimum/maximum hang times. PN con-\ntainers and administration sets shall be free of the plasticizer\n\n<a id='36fa11fa-c606-4510-8ed2-45df3693d49a'></a>\n\ndi-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) to prevent DEHP contami-\nnation of TNA formulations and IVFE that are infused sepa-\nrately. 2,11 Guidelines for the frequency of tubing changes for\nPN formulations often make a distinction between admixtures\nthat contain IVFE (every 24 hours) and those that contain only\ndextrose and amino acids (no more frequently than 96\nhours). 11,44 However, these recommendations overlook the\npotential for contamination of the filter on all types of PN for-\nmulations. Therefore, administration sets and filters should be\nchanged with each new PN container. For continuous infu-\nsions, this interval will typically be every 24 hours; cycled PN\nwill require tubing and filter changes based on the hours of the\ninfusion. Administration sets used for IVFE infused separately\nshall also be changed with each new infusion (hang time 12\nhours). In cases in which a prolonged IVFE infusion is desir-\nable to promote tolerance, the daily fat emulsion dose should\nbe divided into 2 parts, with a new container and tubing used\nevery 12 hours. 54,55\n\n<a id='9b3b411f-95d8-4bcd-8bdb-971dd2e99b6a'></a>\n\nMultichamber PN bags are available, which are designed to reduce the risk for instability or precipitation. These multi-chamber bags separate components of the PN formulation with a bar or seal until just prior to administration. The contents of the chambers should be mixed and additives introduced by pharmacy staff prior to dispensing the formulation. 56 However, if these products are used in home care, patients and/or care-givers shall be provided with thorough training regarding the procedure for properly mixing the product before use. In addition, the containers should be accompanied by auxiliary labels alerting users to the need to mix the product prior to administration.57\n\n<a id='a7a038fd-115e-4552-b305-5a7a4fe17523'></a>\n\nInfusion practices. PN infusions should be administered according to the prescribed rate via an infusion pump. Nurses shall verify the correct rate when the PN infusion is initiated, at regular intervals during the infusion, and at hand-offs. ⁵⁸ Scheduled changes in the prescribed administration rate should be based on patient tolerance and metabolic stability. In acute care settings, PN is commonly infused continuously over 24 hours. However, a schedule in which the PN is cycled to infuse over 10 to 14 hours (based on patient tolerance) can offer physiologic and psychological benefits to patients in selected circumstances. ⁵⁹,⁶⁰ The conversion from a continuous to a cycled administration period typically takes place by reducing the infusion time by 4 to 6 hours each day until the infusion time has been compressed to the target duration. However, one recent study suggests that cycling PN to 12 hours can be accomplished in one step. ⁶¹ A report documenting a high incidence of adverse events associated with PN cycling underscores the importance of close patient monitoring during the transition to cycled PN. ⁶⁰ At each stage, the healthcare team must assess tolerance of the cyclic infusion before advancing to the next step.\n\n<a id='1ec0bde2-be2f-4ee6-bf09-e750f8cb50e8'></a>\n\nHyperglycemia, edema, or symptoms of fluid intolerance\nsignal the need for a more cautious approach to cyclic infusion.\nAdult patients tolerate abrupt discontinuation of PN without\n\n<a id='37c41377-a1b1-438d-bd52-0388363bef27'></a>\n\n330\n\n<a id='060455b2-56ff-431e-826f-fc97e849a247'></a>\n\nJournal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition 38(3)\n\n<a id='8b9dcec8-b7c4-48e9-b694-cebf5473a6a6'></a>\n\nexperiencing rebound hypoglycemia. 62 However, a 30- to 60-minute taper-down period is customarily used with ambulatory PN infusion pumps that perform this function automatically. 63 On the other hand, pediatric patients younger than 2 or 3 years old are prone to developing hypoglycemia with abrupt discontinuation of PN and therefore require more gradual taper-down procedures in conjunction with cycling. 59,60 During the transition to a cycled PN regimen, on-cycle and off-cycle glucose monitoring should take place daily. Once patient tolerance to cycled PN is established, less frequent glucose monitoring may be acceptable, especially in stable home PN patients. 64\n\n<a id='a6099957-9263-4fc8-b2ca-d866dc45d100'></a>\n\nWhen transitioning to cyclic PN, dosing regimens for insu-\nlin should be tailored to avoid abnormal fluctuations in blood\nglucose levels. In patients for whom PN is the sole source of\nnutrition, giving subcutaneous correctional dose insulin in the\nfinal phase of the cycle could lead to hypoglycemia when the\nPN infusion is discontinued. On the other hand, when PN for-\nmulations contain large doses of insulin, patients may require\nintermediate or long-acting insulin to prevent hyperglycemia\nafter the PN stops.\n\n<a id='d74475b0-8c25-493e-ad67-989eb07d4361'></a>\n\nUnscheduled interruptions in the infusion should be avoided because they may contribute to metabolic disturbances and suboptimal nutrient delivery. PN administration should not be interrupted for medication administration.⁴ PN should be discontinued prior to discharge or transport to another facility. As noted earlier, a taper-down period is a gradual reduction in the PN rate. Adult patients do not require a taper; however, a taper period for pediatric patients receiving PN prevents rebound hypoglycemia.\n\n<a id='a8802c19-ebf4-4b2f-9123-0fcf2fe21149'></a>\n\nThe risks of metabolic complications, particularly those\nrelated to glycemic control, have raised questions regarding\nthe safety of continuing PN during operative procedures.\nHowever, no studies have adequately examined this issue. One\nsurvey of pediatric anesthesiologists revealed a high degree of\nvariability in the clinical management of blood glucose levels\nin patients receiving PN during anesthesia. 65 As with other\nareas of PN administration, healthcare organizations should\ndevelop clear and consistent policies that address intraopera-\ntive PN infusion. When the PN infusion is continued during\nsurgery, the prescribed infusion rate should be maintained,\nwith close monitoring of blood glucose levels and insulin\nadministration as needed to maintain glycemic control. The use\nof PN infusions for fluid resuscitation shall be avoided.\n\n<a id='b032557e-490c-444e-bf09-e2c9385da28b'></a>\n\nMedication administration. Historically, PN formulations were viewed as convenient vehicles for delivery of medications such as heparin, insulin, and histamine (H₂) receptor antagonists. However, a better understanding of factors that impact the stabil-ity of PN formulations and the potential for drug-nutrient inter-actions warrants a more conservative approach to medication administration with PN formulations. The mixture of medica-tions in PN preparations is being addressed more specifically in A.S.P.E.N.'s forthcoming parenteral nutrition clinical guide-lines, which are to be published in the near future.\n\n<a id='9a986975-dea8-44bc-bd3f-7207f760ae9d'></a>\n\nIncompatibility reactions range from discoloration, degradation\nof nutrients or medication, and formation of precipitates, to loss\nof emulsion integrity in TNA formulations. The greatest risk for\nincompatibility exists with medications that are added directly to\nthe PN formulation due to the prolonged time of contact between\nthe medication and PN components with direct admixtures. 66\nStandardized commercial PN products that require further addi-\ntives prior to patient administration should be prepared in the\npharmacy under aseptic conditions. Therefore, in acute care set-\ntings, policies shall be implemented that prohibit the addition of\nmedication outside the compounding pharmacy. However, in\nhome care settings, stability considerations often require that\nmedication, such as multivitamin preparations or insulin, be\nadded to PN formulations prior to initiating the infusion. In this\ncase, the addition of medication should take place as close to the\nbeginning of the infusion as possible. Patient and caregiver\ntraining in the proper technique for adding medication to PN\nformulations shall be documented. The additions should be\nmade as close to the beginning of the infusion as possible to\nreduce the potential for harm should touch contamination occur\nduring this process.\n\n<a id='982500ea-c608-4724-b791-42910bb0ca55'></a>\n\nAs noted earlier, the optimal way to administer PN is through an IV line (one lumen of a multilumen VAD) reserved solely for that purpose. However, maintaining a dedicated line for PN administration may be impractical or impossible in patients who receive multiple IV medications or have limited vascular access.² Pharmacists must conduct a comprehensive review of stability and compatibility data from the literature and manufacturer of intravenous nutrients before a medication is administered in a PN formulation.\n\n<a id='b1f94761-d3b4-42d8-b13a-dd4573c5438e'></a>\n\nAs with all high-alert medications, PN should be administered as a primary infusion.37 Co-infusion of medication through the same tubing used for PN should also be avoided if possible. Compatibility information should be derived for PN that closely matches the formulation in question. Medication administration policies should explicitly detail safe practices with regard to medication administration in conjunction with PN.\n\n<a id='12ca4c07-58e2-473d-b7b8-41d908618a84'></a>\n\nDocumentation. Organizational policies and procedures shall define documentation practices related to PN administration in accordance with legal and regulatory requirements.

Does education of prescribers improve PN ordering?\n2. What is the maximum safe osmolarity of PN admixtures intended for peripheral vein administration?\n3. What are the appropriate calcium intake and the calcium-phosphate ratios in PN for optimal neonatal bone mineralization?\n4. What are the clinical advantages or disadvantages of commercially available premade (\"premixed\") PN formulations compared with compounded PN formulations?\n5. What are the clinical (infection, catheter occlusion) advantages or disadvantages of 2-in-1 compared with 3-in-1 PN admixtures?\n6. What macronutrient dosing limits are expected to provide for the most stable 3-in-1 admixtures?\n7. What are the most appropriate recommendations for optimizing calcium (gluconate) and (Na- or K-) phosphate compatibility in PN admixtures?\n8. What micronutrient contamination is present in parenteral stock solutions currently used to compound PN admixtures?\n9. Is it safe to use the PN admixture as a vehicle for non-nutrient medication delivery?\n10. Should heparin be included in the PN admixture to reduce the risk of central vein thrombosis?\n11. What methods of repackaging IVFE into smaller patient-specific volumes are safe?\n12. What beyond-use date should be used for\n    a.

The appropriate use of this complex therapy aims to maximize clinical benefit while minimizing the potential risks for adverse events. Complications can occur as a result of the therapy, as well as the result of the PN formulation process. These consensus recommendations are based on practices generally accepted to minimize errors with PN therapy and categorized in the areas of PN prescribing, order review and verification, compounding, and administration. These recommendations should be used in conjunction with other A.S.P.E.N. publications, and researchers should consider studying the questions brought forth in this document.\n\n<a id='e9537215-75aa-4ea8-941b-fc80df9cb5d2'></a>\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThis unfunded project was completed by authors and reviewers using their time as volunteers.
