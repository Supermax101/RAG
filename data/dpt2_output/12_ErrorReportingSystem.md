SELF-ASSESSMENT #1

A patient became hyperglycemic when the insulin prescribed in his PN was inadvertently omitted during its preparation. In which step in the parenteral use process did this error occur?

A. Prescribing and order review
B. Verify/review the PN order
C. Administration
D. Compounding and dispensing

## SELF-ASSESSMENT #2

The approach to PN ordering in your organization is different between the critical care patients and the patients in the general medical/surgery patient care areas. What approach could be used to reduce the possibility of errors in prescribing and order review for your entire organization?

A. Do nothing, the clinicians are used to the system and there have been no reported errors or patient events
B. Develop an interdisciplinary task force consisting of clinicians from both areas to review the prescribing methods and recommend adoption of 1 method of PN ordering
C. Adopt a standardized approach to reporting and classifying PN-associated errors and near misses to assist in improving your PN system
D. Adopt the ordering method used in the critical care area to the entire organization

# NUTRITION SUPPORT

*   Nutrition support is a complicated medical therapy that includes a nutrition care plan, modification of diet based on disease condition, use of dietary supplements and if needed, enteral and parenteral nutrition
*   EN and PN are complex treatments
    *   Involving multiple dosage of nutrients
    *   Affecting multiple biological processes
*   Risk extends beyond their side effects or complications
    *   Errors in the system

Interdisciplinary care
<::flowchart
: The flowchart illustrates the interdisciplinary care process for EN-PN (Enteral Nutrition - Parenteral Nutrition).

**Roles and Steps:**

1.  **Dietitian, NSS:**
    *   **Assess:** EN-PN Indication

2.  **Prescriber:**
    *   **Ordering EN-PN:** Standardized order form, Standard PN

3.  **Pharmacist:**
    *   **EN-PN Order Review:** Verification, Complete, balanced, Dosing, Stability, compatibility
    *   **EN-PN Compounding/Preparation:** Sterile preparation, Safety checks/testing
    *   **Dispensing EN-PN:** Labeling, Delivery, Storage

4.  **Nurse, Patient caregiver:**
    *   **EN-PN Administration:** Order verification: label vs order, Access, Infusion, Infection control

5.  **Monitoring:** Mechanical: access, Metabolic, Outcome

**Central Component:**

*   **Documentation:** Medical record, Transitional care

**Flow and Connections:**

*   A solid arrow labeled "Access" goes from "Assess" to "Ordering EN-PN".
*   A solid arrow goes from "Ordering EN-PN" to "EN-PN Order Review".
*   A solid arrow goes from "EN-PN Order Review" to "EN-PN Compounding/Preparation".
*   A solid arrow goes from "EN-PN Compounding/Preparation" to "Dispensing EN-PN".
*   A solid arrow goes from "Dispensing EN-PN" to "EN-PN Administration".
*   A solid arrow goes from "EN-PN Administration" to "Monitoring".
*   A solid arrow goes from "Monitoring" back to "Assess", completing a loop.

*   Dotted double-headed arrows connect "Documentation" to all other steps: "Ordering EN-PN", "EN-PN Order Review", "EN-PN Compounding/Preparation", "Dispensing EN-PN", "EN-PN Administration", and "Monitoring".

## HEALTH SYSTEM SAFETY:
## ERROR REPORTING

*   Errors in the system result from:
    *   Systems issues
    *   Performance
    *   Knowledge
*   Factors involved with EN/PN errors:
    *   Nutrition education in health professionals is inconsistent
    *   EN/PN processes once developed are seldom revised and updated
    *   Error reporting systems are infrequently present to investigate opportunities for system improvement, modernizing therapy and improving clinician competence in prescribing and managing nutrition therapy
