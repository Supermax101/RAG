* Match prescribing and pharmacy templates
* Build, test, and heed automated warnings
* Heighten suspicions of errors
* Carry out effective redundancies
* Provide clear labeling
  * Label should always match the PN order template in the PN order form/CPOE system and the ACD
* Educate and validate competency
* Eliminate transcription of PN orders

# SAFE PN PRESCRIBING KEY RECOMMENDATIONS

**PN Orders:**
*   Full generic names (unless multiple products or indicates unique properties of the ingredient)
*   Include related orders for labs, monitoring parameters
*   Use only TJC-approved abbreviations, avoid ISMP error-prone abbreviations
*   Avoid addition of non-nutrient medications when possible (if necessary, only when clear compatibility data exist)
*   Develop protocols to allow modification of PN orders when incompatibilities exist
    *   Document in medical record, communicate with team
    *   Signed by prescriber

SAFE PN PRESCRIBING
KEY RECOMMENDATIONS

* PN Education should be provided to ALL disciplines/personnel involved in PN-use process
* Training should include didactic and experiential components
* Knowledge and skills of all individuals involved in PN-use process should be assessed
* Should be part of clinical training programs
* Materials and processes shall be developed and led by clinicians with expertise in the area of nutrition support, preferably from multiple disciplines

COMPOUNDED PN VS. MCB-PN
A brown rectangular banner with white text and a white outline illustration of a person receiving an IV drip.::>

<a id='a0c410c3-d67d-4da1-b606-dbc95e14f236'></a>

MCB-PN Considerations

* MCB-PN products identified for central vs. peripheral administration
* If entire MCB-PN bag not infused, need instructions to discard the remainder of bag
* MCB-PN listed amounts per liter or bag. Tools are needed to help prescriber identify amounts per day
* MCB-PN list as ions. Tools are needed to help prescribers

<a id='b9178520-a345-4119-9511-762d45b4186a'></a>

## PN Considerations
* Administration route/infusion via central or peripheral vein
* Volume and infusion rate
* PN ingredients ordered as amount per bag
* PN salts ordered as salts

CAPTION ERROR

<a id='21ab72e2-4acf-40c4-a558-0177c82175d0'></a>

## MCB-PN Considerations
* MCB-PN products ordered by brand name
* MCB-PN ordered vis concentrations (5% amino acid-15% dextrose). Tools are needed to calculate amounts per day based on volume
* Electrolyte dosing dependent on type of MCB-PN and volume infused.
* If entire MCB-PN bag not infused the entire dose ordered will not be administered

<a id='3e826857-f05d-4afd-bc60-74d527d4f55f'></a>

PN Considerations

* Full generic names for each ingredient. Use brand names when multiple products exist/brand may assist in identifying product
* Dosing for each macronutrient
* Dosing for each electrolyte
* Dosing for each non-nutrient (e.g. insulin)

SELF ASSESSMENT #2

A 68 year-old man is transferred from a long-term acute care hospital to the acute care ICU with worsening respiratory status. He required mechanical ventilation via his tracheostomy. He has required EN at the LTACH and the ICU team would like to resume EN. His nurse stated that she received report that the patient has been complaining of abdominal pain and nausea and that his PEG tube was pulled out a few more centimeters than previously noted on a prior admission. Your first recommendation to the team is:

A. Check a KUB to confirm tube placement before starting tube feeds
B. Order the formula he was receiving at the LTACH
C. Tell the team to order an aggressive bowel regimen
D. Hold EN and start PN until his abdominal pain is fully evaluated

EN USE PROCESS
<::flowchart
: The flowchart illustrates the EN Use Process, which is a cyclical process with a central element of "Documentation".

The steps are as follows:
1. Prescribe an EN regimen
2. Review the EN order
3. Procure, select/prepare, label, and dispense EN
4. Administer EN regimen
5. Monitor and reassess the patient
6. Assess the patient, their enteral access, and recommend an EN regimen

Arrows indicate the flow from step 1 to 6, and then from step 6 back to step 1, forming a continuous loop.

    *   The EHR could be programmed to not allow the order to be signed until that part of the order set is complete

    *   Will depend on the institution and type of patient
    *   ICU may be daily to every other day
    *   Stable non-ICU, acute care patient may be every 2-7 days
    *   On transfer long-term acute care or a skilled nursing facility may be every 1-4 weeks, or depending on regulatory agency requirements

    *   Change in renal function
    *   Change in hydration status (need for more concentrated or dilute formula)
*   A major change in weight prompting a recalculation of energy and protein requirements
*   A change in the administration method:
    *   Continuous to cycled
    *   Continuous to bolus/intermittent
    *   Cycled or bolus back to continuous

## MRS. JONES ORDER REVIEW

Mrs. Jones has extubated, but was found to have dysphagia on her swallowing evaluation. A nasogastric tube was placed for tube feeding. She is making progress with physical therapy and hates being hooked up to the pump. Her capillary glucoses have all been < 110 mg/dL and she is not happy with the frequent glucose checks. She is still receiving the high protein formula at 50 mL/hr.

*   Review the order: is it still appropriate? How will you decide?
    *   Has her clinical status changed?
    *   Are her energy and protein needs the same or does she need reassessment?
    *   Should the order be changed?

▪ Needs:
  – 30 kcal/kg = 1440 kcals; 1.3 g protein/kg = 62 g
▪ Since she hates the pump and is ambulatory, consider a bolus feeding schedule
  – Change to a standard formula: 250 kcals, 10.5 g protein, 34 g carbohydrate,
    8 g fat, and 199 mL water in one 237 mL carton
▪ If we do a bolus schedule, she would need 6 cartons/day:
  – 2 cartons (474 mL) three times/day = 1500 kcals, 63 g protein, 204 g
    carbohydrate, 48g fat, and 1194 mL water
  – She needs an additional ~ 300 mL to provide 1mL of water/kcal (RDA)

TRANSITION OF CARE

- Mrs. Jones continues to make progress, but because of her prolonged intubation, she has not regained her swallowing function. She is making progress with her speech therapy and the team would like to send her home on tube feeding through her NGT since they think she will be able to eat within the next few weeks.
- The care coordinating nurse reviews Mrs. Jones' insurance and she has Medicare as a primary insurance, and no secondary.

# SELF ASSESSMENT #2

A 68 year-old male is transferred from a long-term acute care hospital to the acute care ICU with worsening respiratory status. He required mechanical ventilation via his tracheostomy. He has required EN at the LTACH and the ICU team would like to resume EN. His nurse stated that she received report that the patient has been complaining of abdominal pain and nausea and that his PEG tube was pulled out a few more centimeters than previously noted on a prior admission. Your first recommendation to the team is:

A. Check a KUB to confirm tube placement before starting tube feeds
B. Order the formula he was receiving at the LTACH
C. Tell the team to order an aggressive bowel regimen
D. Hold EN and start PN until his abdominal pain is fully evaluated

CONCLUSIONS

*   A system should be developed to assist in communicating the daily macro and micro nutrient provisions if utilizing multi-chamber parenteral nutrition bags
*   Successful transitions of care involve communication to the next provider and well-defined orders and instructions
