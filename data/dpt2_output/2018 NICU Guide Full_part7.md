VI. Outcomes

A. Mortality estimates for VLBW infants has been reported at ~20-40%, but may be higher in some patient groups based on severity of NEC, birth weight, and gestational age.

B. Surgery for NEC has been reported to be required in 25-60% of cases. Subsequent stricture formation is reported in 25-35% of cases.

C. Short-gut syndrome, feeding abnormalities, abscess formation, bowel obstruction, and cholestasis are all possible consequences of NEC and its treatment.

D. Multi-center, retrospective analyses of extremely low birth weight premature infant data suggest that higher risk of adverse neurodevelopmental outcome is associated with greater NEC severity and need for surgery

Gastroschisis and omphaloceles are frequently encountered congenital anomalies in pediatric surgery. The combined incidence of these anomalies is 1 in 2000 births. There is no geographic or racial predilection and the male to female ratio is 1.5:1. The combined survival rate is >90% due to improved care of low birth weight and premature infants, including improved anesthetic management and surgical techniques.

<a id='e03aa3a9-b763-446a-a441-ce6eb0d906bc'></a>

I. **Embryology**

A. In the trilaminar embryo, body folds (cephalic, caudal, lateral) fuse centrally, where amnion invests the yolk sac.
B. By week 6, rapid growth of midgut and herniation through umbilical ring occurs.
C. By week 10, abdominal cavity sufficiently enlarged to accommodate midgut.
D. As the intestine returns, rotation and fixation occur.
E. This process does not occur in babies with gastroschisis or omphalocele; hence, there is a risk of developing midgut volvulus.

<a id='5907ee15-3790-42d0-a783-27c7fed0a3d8'></a>

## II. Gastroschisis

### A. Definition
1. Defect due to obstruction of the omphalomesenteric vessels during development.
2. Portion of abdominal wall fails to form (i.e., full-thickness defect), causing extrusion of intestines.
3. Defect usually arises to the right of umbilicus; generally small (<2 cm) compared to volume of eviscerated bowel.
4. Umbilical cord is not involved, and parts of organs may be in the amniotic fluid, and not enclosed in a membranous sac.

### B. Comorbidities
1. Incidence of chromosomal anomalies <5%.
2. GERD or Hirschsprung disease.
3. Malabsorption or motility disorder.

### C. Considerations
1. Defect fairly uniform in size (3-5 cm vertical opening) and location (to the right of umbilicus).
2. If gastroschisis identified in prenatal period:
   a. Serial sonography to assess intestinal integrity and detect signs of intestinal injury (e.g. decrease

Abdominal Wall Defects

D. Management of Gastroschisis

1. At delivery: Place infant into Vi-Drape® Abdominal Isolation Bag to contain bowel and promote moisture
2. Pediatric Surgery Service notified.
3. Open abdominal wound with extruded intestine puts these patients at increased risk for hypothermia, dehydration, sepsis, and hypoglycemia. Appropriate medical and nursing care provided includes:
   a. Parenteral nutrition
   b. Antibiotic coverage
   c. Warming bed
   d. Vascular access
   e. OG tube to LCS for abdominal decompression
   f. Cardiopulmonary support
4. Feasibility of reduction and closure determined by:
   a. Amount of inflammation, edema, and intestinal turgor
   b. Size of abdominal cavity
5. Inflammation may distort bowel appearance; therefore, it is difficult to determine if atresia is present.
   a. Delay correction of intestinal atresia until several weeks after initial repair.
6. Intestinal dysfunction may take at least 4-6 wks to normalize.
   a. Monitor NG/OG tube output
   b. Follow signs of bowel function.

<a id='39d6b072-d647-41f6-99e8-374bbcb914be'></a>

E. Primary Reduction with Sutureless Closure of Gastroschisis

1. Bowel contents easily reduced after birth.

   a. Surgeon will wrap the umbilical cord over opening, apply a pressure dressing (Tegaderm™) at bedside or in the OR with sedation or anesthesia.

   b. Tegaderm™ may be removed after 7 days and wound left open to air, per surgical team.

   c. Cord forms an eschar over the site as abdominal defect beneath contracts in and granulates.

      i. Wait for eschar to spontaneously fall off.

      ii. Wound care managed by Peds Surgery NP

F. **Reduction of Gastroschisis with Silo and Sutureless Closure**

1.  When intestines are inflamed a temporary silo is needed.
    a. Bentec® silo 5 cm used and applied at bedside or in OR. Other available sizes, rarely used, are Bentec® silo 3,4 and 7 cm.
    b. Reduction once bowel softer, more pliable:
        i. At bedside, surgical team will reduce bowel in silo daily until bowel within abdominal caviy; usually takes about 1 week.
        ii. Administration of sucrose and/or morphine or fentanyl to aid with pain relief, sedation as needed.
    c. Once bowel completely reduced, silo removed at bedside by Pediatric Surgery NP/Surgeon.
        i. Pre-medicate with morphine or fentanyl to aid with pain relief, sedation as needed.
        ii. Wound care supplies available:
            1) 3M™ No Sting Skin Barrier swabs
            2) Mepitel® (non-adherent silicone barrier)
            3) Mepilex® 4x4 (silicone foam)
            4) Gauze 2x2 and 4x4
            5) Tegaderm™ (large) x 2
2.  Continue specific wound care regimen with supplies listed above to allow granulation and epithelialization.
    a. Administer sucrose for dressing changes at the bedside.
    b. First week after silo removed, dressing changes performed by Peds Surgery NP/Surgeon.
    c. Bedside RN may continue to apply dressing changes as directed by Peds Surgery NP/Surgeon (refer to NICU Nursing Policy and Procedures on the LPCH Intranet).
3.  The use of negative pressure wound therapy device (wound V.A.C. therapy) may be utilized at the discretion of the pediatric general surgery service.
    a. Refer to LPCH Policy & Procedure: Wound Care – Wound Vacuum Assisted Closure (V.A.C.) Device Management and take necessary precautions of the use of the wound VAC therapy on the neonatal patient.
        i. Pre-fill the drainage canister with water to limit the drainage collection to about 50-100 ml or as directed by of the pediatric surgeon/NP.
        ii. The suction pressure will be determined by the pediatric surgeon/NP. (Usually pressure of 50-75 mmHg.)

G. Outcome

1. Reducible umbilical hernia is common.
   a. Will spontaneously close over time.
   b. If by school-age, hernia still evident, then surgical repair is an option.
2. Follow-up with pediatric surgery in the outpatient setting.
3. Epithelialized skin over abdominal defect for complete closure.
4. When sutures applied, closure is off-center from natural umbilicus.
5. Patient tolerates oral intake, growing, and developing normally.
6. Long-term morbidity related to intestinal dysfunction and wound problems.
7. Prognosis depends on severity of associated problems (e.g. prematurity, intestinal atresia, short gut, and intestinal inflammatory dysfunction).

III. **Omphalocele**

A. Definition

1. Abdominal wall defect in which intestines, liver, and occasionally other organs remain outside abdomen in a sac due to defect in development of abdominal wall musculature.
2. Sac protrudes in midline, through umbilicus, may be central, epigastric or hypogastric.
3. Contained in translucent sac composed of amnion, Wharton jelly, and peritoneum; usually occurs at base of umbilical cord with cord inserting at its apex.
4. Sac may be ruptured in 10-20% of cases and surgical primary closure or placement of Bentec silo may be attempted or application of the negative pressure wound therapy device (or wound V.A.C. therapy).

<a id='85c69d21-80b3-45e2-8c46-6f28952cf1c7'></a>

B. Categorized as:
1. Liver-containing (i.e., giant omphalocele, diameter of defect >10 cm).
   a. Small, undeveloped abdominal and thoracic cavities.
   b. May be associated with restrictive lung disease and pulmonary hypoplasia.
   c. Usually more difficult operative closures.
2. Non-liver containing (i.e. containing only bowel, diameter of defect 4-10 cm).

C. Comorbidities
1. Babies with omphalocele have a 35-80% incidence of other clinical problems, such as congenital heart disease, cleft palate, and musculoskeletal and dental occlusion abnormalities.
2. Incidence of associated chromosomal abnormalities is 10-40%

Abdominal Wall Defects 299
Giant omphalocele is associated with small, bell-shaped thoracic cavities and pulmonary hypoplasia. Initial attempts at surgical reduction and repair resulted in increased risk for infection, respiratory failure, prolonged ventilator support and tracheostomy, GI dysfunction requiring prolonged parenteral nutrition causing hepatomegaly and TPN cholestasis. Knowing that pulmonary growth and development continue well into childhood, the current practice is to provide initially, non-operative management to induce epithelialization followed by possible delayed repair, with use of the following:

<a id='1b528759-a723-4648-8364-e6989d81e3f6'></a>

a. Silvadene® (silver sulfadiazine) – accepted use with no complications
b. Compression with ACE® wrap
c. Custom-made foam silo

2. Criteria include the following:
a. Meets definition for giant omphalocele
b. Cardiopulmonary status is stable
c. Any signs and symptoms of infection being treated

3. Plan for therapy
a. Consult occupational therapy (OT).
b. Pediatric Surgery NP, bedside RN and OT will work with the families to teach them how to apply the abdominal dressing for daily changes.
c. Supplies:
   i. Silvadene® cream
   ii. 4x4 gauze
   iii. Kerlix® gauze
   iv. ACE® wrap (2" or 3")
   v. Foam (blue & brown) to form silo/splint, Velcro® straps
   vi. Tape and Scissors
   vii. Skin barrier (if needed)
      1) Hydrocolloid (Duoderm® or Comfeel®)
      2) 3M™ No-Sting Skin Barrier Spray
   viii. Suspension (if needed), refer to OT & Peds Surgery NP

b. Aid with epithelialization over the sac.

c. Protect visceral organs.

   i. Liver is in epigastrium, prevent trauma.

d. Support the abdominal lesion vertically (i.e., chimney) to allow gravity to aid with spontaneous reduction over time of bowel content and organs and prevent mechanical obstruction of GI tract.

e. Decrease length of stay, initiate feeding, decrease complications and mortality.

f. Complete reduction with umbilical hernia to allow spontaneous closure over time.

g. By school-age, umbilical hernia may be surgically repaired.

h. Discharge considerations: infants discharged with giant omphaloceles may require a special car seat adapted to accommodate the defect. Consult the surgical NP for information.

Clinical Approach to Conjugated Hyperbilirubinemia
(Neonatal Cholestasis)

<a id='76d76e5b-6e6e-4f94-959a-b0ba05c5a4fd'></a>

Vinod K. Bhutani, M.D. and Ronald J. Wong

<a id='00f2e7d4-5014-4595-a09d-5f70c0ae8d51'></a>

I. **Indication**

Jaundice observed in a neonate that persists or recurs during the second week of life requires evaluation. Frequently, such jaundice is due to elevation of the unconjugated or indirect bilirubin, and is often benign and the result of a natural process. More concerning is jaundice due to an elevation of the _conjugated_ bilirubin fraction.

Neonatal cholestasis is due to an impairment in canalicular bile flow and results in an accumulation of biliary substances, such as bilirubin and bile acids. Manifestations of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia must be differentiated from those due to unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, as it is more often associated with a specific disease process. The medical management of cholestasis is largely supportive because the underlying disease is often untreatable. As such, treatment strategies mainly address complications of chronic cholestasis rather than the underlying cause(s). These complications include malabsorption, nutritional deficiencies, and pruritus.

<a id='6491d37b-fcbc-4a95-9717-2afff6614b57'></a>

A DIRECT BILIRUBIN LEVEL > 1 mg/dL SHOULD PROMPT FURTHER EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT

A. Clinical

1.  Laboratory Levels
    a. Direct bilirubin > 10% of total bilirubin (TB < 5 mg/dL)
    b. Conjugated bilirubin > 1 mg/dL (TB < 5 mg/dL)
    c. Direct bilirubin > 20% of TB (TB > 5 mg/dL)
    d. Conjugated bilirubin > 2 mg/dL (TB > 5 mg/dL)

2.  Clinical Risk Factors for Direct Hyperbilirubinemia
    a. An infant noted to be jaundiced at 2 wks of age should be evaluated for cholestasis with measurement of TB and direct bilirubin.

3.  Clinical Manifestations
    a. Onset of jaundice after the first week of age should be considered abnormal
    b. Persistence of jaundice after 2 wks of age should be considered abnormal
    c. Association of pale stools and/or dark urine should be an alert for cholestasis

<a id='c6c1bf6a-cc6a-4ea8-8770-e6bc8aae9d0a'></a>

B. Testing. The most commonly-used laboratory determination (the diazo or van den Bergh method) does not specifically measure conjugated bilirubin, but reports only direct bilirubin. For methodological reasons, the higher the TB (even if it is all unconjugated), the higher the reported direct bilirubin. Measurements of direct bilirubin may vary significantly both within and between laboratories.

V. Bilirubin Follow-Up

A. Serial TB/direct bilirubin for progression of hyperbilirubinemia until levels decline

1. Newborns ≥ 35 wks gestational age (GA)
   a. For onset of Jaundice: check immediately
   b. Persistence: check every 1 to 2 days until levels plateau or decline
   c. Aggressively investigate for etiology
2. Newborns < 35 wks GA
   a. All infants: check levels every day initially
   b. Serial follow-up until TB decline: 1 to 2 times/week based on rate of rise or decline of TB.
C. After significant decline: may track clinical resolution of jaundice

VI. Management

A. Nutritional Goal
The goal is to discontinue parenteral feeds and transition to full enteral feeds. In infants that are not tolerating full enteral feeds, management includes initiating trophic enteral feeds, changing TPN substrates (e.g., limiting glucose intake to 15 gm/kg/d, supplementation with taurine and glutamine, limiting intake of lipid emulsions, cycling of the TPN to 12 hrs/day), and removing trace elements (such as copper and manganese), which will build up in the liver and cause toxicity.

B. Medications.
Pharmacologic management includes ursodeoxycholic acid to increase bile acid excretion. Cholecystokinin-octapetide and the cholecystokinin analogue, ceruletide, may prevent cholelithiasis or liver disease in patients receiving TPN by stimulating gallbladder contraction.

C. Growth Parameters and Nutrition Assessment
Height- and weight-for-age and weigh- for-height, should be closely followed by tracking growth velocity, percentile track and signs of malabsorption of fats.

<a id='20b4f4d3-84cb-44a3-9bd4-872157465994'></a>

D. **Nutrient Choices**
Long chain fatty acids are not well absorbed and this leads to malnutrition and fat-soluble vitamin deficiency. Medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) are more readily absorbed and are a better source of fat calories. These infants should be started on a formula containing MCT, such as Pregestimil or Alimentum®. If oral intake is not sufficient, patients may be started on continuous nasogastric (NG) feeds. Due to steatorrhea and increased energy expenditure, the caloric intake goal should be 125% of recommended dietary allowance based on ideal body weight.

<a id='e6bc07a0-3283-4c09-8c05-be186c8f99da'></a>

E. Vitamins
The intestinal absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) requires the presence of bile acids. Doses of at least 2 to 4 times the recommended daily allowance are given. Vitamin supplementation should continue for 3 months after resolution of jaundice.

**F. Phototherapy Use for Neonates with Cholestasis**
The bronze infant syndrome is the dark, grayish-brown discoloration of skin as a complication of phototherapy and may be due to accumulation of porphyrins and other metabolites. This is generally benign and if there is an urgent need for phototherapy for excessive unconjugated bilirubinemia, direct hyperbilirubinemia should not be an absolute contraindication. However, the products of phototherapy are excreted in bile and cholestasis can reduce the effectiveness of phototherapy or may impair bilirubin-albumin binding. Furthermore, the potential neurotoxicity of the isomers attributed to conjugated bilirubin and the "bronze pigment" or porphyrins has not been excluded. Importantly, the direct serum bilirubin should not be subtracted from the TB concentration when making decisions about exchange transfusions.

I. **Definition:**

A. Blood pressure (BP) elevated above the upper 95% confidence interval for neonates/infants of similar gestational age, post-menstrual age or size.

B. Incidence 0.2-3% (NICUs tend to be on the higher end of the range).

<a id='0ddafd6a-46a9-4e66-8fbd-4d0866f3052d'></a>

## II. Normative blood pressure data:

A. One challenge when diagnosing hypertension in neonates is the fact that the normative BP range is dynamic and changes based upon gestational age, postnatal or post-menstrual age, birth weight, and size for gestational age. Obtaining accurate blood pressure in a neonate is also extremely difficult.

B. The following two figures and one table are three sources of normative data:

### III. Diagnosis of hypertension

A. Appropriate BP monitoring can be obtained using the following methods:

1. Manual oscillometry

B. Most normative BP data has been collected using measurements obtained in the right arm.

C. BPs should be obtained/recorded while asleep, as increased activity, including oral feeding, can increase BP significantly.

D. If oscillometry is used:

1. Measurements should be obtained in upper extremity, as measurements in the lower extremities are usually higher than the upper extremities.
2. BPs should be obtained in the same extremity for subsequent measurements.
3. The cuff bladder should be 2/3 the length of the arm and 0.44 to 0.55 of the arm circumference.
4. If choosing between a cuff that is too large and too small, use the cuff that is too large.
5. Consider checking BP 10-15 min after BP cuff has been applied.

E. If hypertension is suspected, the measurement should be repeated several times.

F. Diagnosis of hypertension requires 2-3 appropriately measured blood pressures greater than the 95th percentile based on age and weight.

G. Once diagnosis is made, the Pediatric Nephrology Service should be consulted.

C. Prior to initiating therapy, all iatrogenic causes should be assessed and eliminated.

D. Laboratory evaluation should be performed prior to initiating therapy.

E. As soon as you begin treating an infant for hypertension, begin thinking about obtaining insurance authorization for an outpatient blood pressure monitoring device.

I. **Definition**

A. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) has replaced the term "Acute Renal Failure" and is defined as an abrupt decline in renal function.

B. Historically, AKI has been defined as "an elevated serum creatinine" or the onset of oliguria. However, a more academic approach to the diagnosis of AKI has been proposed (Table 1).

C. Formal application of the below definition may not always be appropriate in the clinical setting. However, the use of such a standard definition has demonstrated that even mild episodes of AKI (creatinine increase ≥ 0.3mg/dL) are associated with poorer outcomes and the fact that outcomes are worse with increasing AKI severity.

D. Unlike adult onset AKI, neonatal AKI is often non-oliguric and urine output is an insensitive marker of renal injury.

II. **Determining renal function and normative GFR Data**

A. Currently, the creatinine clearance or glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is best estimated using the Schwartz equation:

<a id='f878d6d8-6c07-4a51-a76a-4a0be6feeaa3'></a>

(k) * (height/length in centimeters)
Serum creatinine

In this equation, "k" represents a constant that is multiplied by the patient's height in cm and divided by the serum creatinine (mg/dL). The original Schwartz equation used k = 0.33 for preterm infants and k = 0.45 for term infants. However, this equation was based upon an older creatinine determination method that is no longer used (Jaffe). A newer Schwartz was developed using the current creatinine methodology (enzymatic), however, this equation was developed in children with CKD aged 1-17 years. Thus, it has NOT been validated in neonates and it is valid only for the eGFR range of 15-75mL/min/1.73m2. The constant "k" for this equation is 0.41 for all patients regardless of age.

<a id='9b39529f-b029-4a4f-8247-ed3368d1be1d'></a>

The current recommendation is to calculate the estimated GFR by both methods and report those two
values as a range

B. GFR doesn't reach normal adult values (120mL/min/1.73m2) until 1-2 years of age. Normal GFR values are:

<a id='fd0c5054-109a-4869-ad63-c3d95db9195e'></a>

1. Term neonate at birth: 25-30mL/min/1.73m2
2. Term neonate at 1-2 weeks of age: 40-55mL/min/1.73m2
3. 2-6 month old infant: 60-80mL/min/1.73m2
4. Normal GFR values for preterm neonates at 7, 14, 21, and 28 days of life.

### III. Incidence of AKI

A. The incidence of AKI in newborns ranges from 0.4-3.5%. The incidence in the NICU, however, may be as high as 8%.

B. Incidence may be higher in at risk groups:

1.  18% in very low birthweight (VLBW) infants between 500-1500g.
2.  52% in infants with congenital heart disease (CHD).
3.  56% in neonates experiencing severe HIE.
4.  4-70% in neonates receiving ECMO.

IV. Renal physiologic concepts relevant to neonatal AKI

A. Renal embryogenesis/glomerulogenesis is complete by 35 weeks gestation. Injuries prior to this point may reduce nephron mass.

B. The perinatal period sees a transition towards increased renal blood flow. Renal blood flow is 2-4% of

cardiac output in the fetus, but increases to 10% in the first post-natal week.

C. Autoregulation of renal blood flow in neonates is less robust than in adults. Neonates are less capable of responding to significant hemodynamic changes.

D. Neonates have a reduced capacity to concentrate the urine and are at greater AKI risk in the setting of reduced intravascular volume.

E. Neonates have increased insensible water loss through the skin. Thus, they may be predisposed to pre-renal azotemia.

## VII. Treatment/Management of AKI

A. Treatment, in most cases, is determined by etiology of renal failure. Patients with AKI should undergo nephrologic consultation.

B. Fluid challenge can be considered in patients thought to be pre-renal as determined by tachycardia hypotension, weight loss, exam, or appropriate renal indices (BUN or FENa).

C. Placement of a Foley catheter should be considered to assist with more precise assessement of urine output.

D. Hyperkalemia. For patients with an elevated serum potassium level, steps should be taken to lower the serum level:
   1. Eliminate sources of potassium (feeds, IV fluids, TPN)
   2. Correction of acidosis, if present (unless concomitant hypocalcemia is present)
   3. Furosemide

<a id='68958bcc-d4da-4115-af71-0dab5c235b3e'></a>

E. Furosemide can be used to convert oliguric to non-oliguric renal failure. There is no data to suggest that furosemide improves outcomes in patients with AKI, however, many practitioners find non-oliguric AKI easier to manage than oliguric AKI.

<a id='fc3701b4-bc81-498c-a24c-7edcfc09d316'></a>

F. Fluid restriction. If fluid administration and diuretics fail to improve urine output in an oliguric AKI patient, it is important to restrict fluids to prevent fluid overload.

1. The most accurate way to assess fluid balance is daily or twice daily weights.

2. When fluid restricting, it is best to administer estimated insensible water needs AND any urine output. Urine output can be determined and replacement adjusted every four hours. Up-To-Date suggests the following estimated insensibles for neonates (Patients on radiant warmers may have greater insensible water losses):

   a. >2500 g — 15 to 25 mL/kg

   b. 1500 to 2500 g — 15 to 35 mL/kg

   c. <1500 g — 30 to 60 mL/kg

<a id='35bebb14-6996-44a2-8864-7ab009653bb4'></a>

G. Augmentation of hemodynamics/blood pressure. For patients who are septic or have either distributive or cardiogenic shock, augmentation of blood pressure with vasoactive agents may improve renal perfusion and reverse AKI. It is important to note that when renal injury is present, hemodynamic autoregulation of the neonatal kidney is further impaired. The relationship between mean arterial pressure (MAP) and GFR may be markedly altered such that GFR may remain inadequate despite a MAP that is normal for a healthy neonate of the same gestation. A MAP in the upper range of normal may be required to provide adequate renal perfusion.
H. Aminophylline can often increase urine output in patients with AKI. It can be administered intermittently (5mg/kg as a one time load followed by 1.8mg/kg Q6 hours) or as a continuous infusion (0.3mg/kg/hr). In either case, the target trough level is 5-10.
I. Renal replacement therapy. If AKI is progressive, neonates may require renal replacement therapy. This can be delivered in various forms (peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis, or continuous renal replacement therapy), depending on the situation.

Note: The VLBW infant often has blood glucoses 145-180 mg/dL due to immaturity. If concerned about an osmotic diuresis, urine glucose can be checked. If no glucose is in the urine, no treatment is needed.

A. Acute onset of hyperglycemia with level >250 mg/dl

1. Consider increasing IVF to 1.5-2 times the current IVF rate to keep infants well-hydrated during osmotic diuresis (start with 1-1.5 times the rate of IVF if the infant is small and/or very sick, then if not improved increase to 2 times the rate).
2. This fluid should be 0.45NS and not contain glucose.
3. Follow glucose every 30 min. to 1 hr and adjust IVF solution when glucose returns to normal range. Watch for rebound hypoglycemia.

D. Excess glucose administration via IVF/TPN (level 145-250 mg/[illegible])

<a id='df5ae91f-3b7a-40b4-a79c-d988f0b0da24'></a>

B. Excess glucose administration via IVF/TPN (level 145-250 mg/dl)

1. Positive urinary glucose level:
   a. Decrease the concentration of dextrose in IVF/TPN. If unable to provide adequate calories/weight gain, maintain IV dextrose and initiate insulin.
   b. Ensure that amino acids are also being infused: the fetal pancreas releases insulin in response to AA, not glucose.
   c. Decrease the infusion rate.
   d. Monitor glucose levels until stable in the normal range.
2. Negative urinary glucose level:
   a. If increasing glucose to increase caloric intake, a higher serum glucose level is acceptable as long as glucose is not being spilled in the urine.

C. Inability to metabolize glucose

1. Decrease the glucose delivery (mg/kg/min) by decreasing concentration of glucose in IVF or the infusion rate.
2. Insulin
   a. Insulin infusion (0.01-0.05 units/kg/hr):
      i. Drip calculation:
         10 x weight (kg) = units/100 ml NS = 1 mL/hr = 0.1 units/mL/hr
      ii. Start at 0.01 units/kg/hr and titrate as needed to keep blood sugar 100-200.
      iii. Check glucose level every 60 min until stable, then every 2-4 hrs.
      iv. Recheck 1 hr after any change in rate.

I. **Fluid Resuscitation in The Treatment Of Neonatal Hypotension**

A. Background

The treatment of severe hypotension in the pre-term infant can be challenging. Fluid resuscitation and pressors are usually the first-line treatments. Concerns in administering volume and colloids, however, include that it may not be effective, repeated administration may result in pulmonary edema and anasarca, and rapid fluid shifts in the setting of impaired cerebral autoregulation may be associated with increased risk for intracerebral hemorrhage. There is also evidence that *albumin* administration not only results in no improvement in outcome, but may be associated with increased mortality in certain patient populations. Finally, low cortisol concentrations in critically ill preterm infants have been associated with several markers of illness, including vasopressor-resistant hypotension, suggesting that one etiology may be relative adrenal insufficiency.

B. Guidelines for preterm hypotensive infants.

<a id='0f71f3f1-9c8d-4fe9-8624-db3a3a79765f'></a>

1. There is significant debate about the "definition" of hypotension in extremely preterm infants and antihypotensive treatment1. Normal BP is often defined as diastolic BP >18-20 mm Hg and mean arterial pressure ≥ gestational age. **However, it is important to recognize that a "safe" or "appropriate" blood pressure has not been defined, particularly with respect to the effect of short-term or long-term blood pressure instability on later outcomes.** Nevertheless, in extremely preterm infants (23-25 weeks EGA), low blood pressure - regardless of treatment - has been associated with worse neurodevelopmental outcomes2. A German Neonatal Network study of VLBW infants showed that hypotension in the first 24 hours was associated with higher rates of death, IVH, and BPD. 3 But there is also substantial variation in the approach to hypotension treatment; clear efficacy of antihypotensive therapy has not been demonstrated, with increasing blood pressure noted among untreated infants as well as those who received antihypotensive agents4-6. A recent NRN analysis showed that those who received antihypotensive treatment, regardless of response, were more likely to die, to have motor dysfunction, or to have developmental delay than untreated infants4 – but this was retrospective analysis, not in the context of a randomized controlled trial of treatment regimens.
2. Cognizant of the limitations above, the following therapeutic approach to UNEXPLAINED severe hypotension should be considered:

NOTE: the resuscitation of patients with ongoing fluid or blood losses such as effusions and bleeding diathesis should be appropriate to those patient findings.

a. Initial volume bolus (10ml/kg) with isotonic saline if the patient is suspected to be hypovolemic.
b. Consider dopamine infusion if patient is considered normovolemic with continued hypotension.
c. Consider repeat volume 10 ml/kg for up to 3 total boluses **if the patient is considered to be hypovolemic.**
d. Blood product support.
   i. PRBC or platelet infusions may be required based on clinical presentation and/or laboratory studies.
   ii. FFP infusion may be considered based on clinical presentation, laboratory studies and/ or response to isotonic saline and inotropic support in the setting of perceived hypovolemia.

3. Monitoring and evaluation
   a. A central line should be in place for the ill neonate requiring volume boluses and inotropic support and CVP should be transduced to guide management.
   b. Consider an echocardiogram to evaluate cardiac anatomy and function for infants suspected of having congenital heart disease, or for infants requiring multiple volume boluses with escalating inotropic support.

4. Hypotension in the following patient categories may demand different diagnostic/therapeutic approaches!

a. Suspicion of congenital heart disease (e.g., presence of heart murmur, large cardiac silhouette on CXR) - consultation with Cardiology should be undertaken.

b. Suspicion of coagulopathy or DIC - Check PT, PTT, fibrinogen, and d-dimer. Appropriate blood products should be administered without delay.

c. Suspicion of sepsis - cultures should be drawn and empiric antibiotics begun while simultaneously addressing cardiovascular instability.

II. **Corticosteroid Replacement for Suspected Adrenal Insufficiency in the Preterm Infant**

A. **Background**

1. An intact hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is crucial for the body to deal with physiologic stressors. Cortisol, which is secreted by the adrenal cortex, is a critical modulator of inflammation, and is required for the body to repair damage. It has been suggested that premature newborns may have a period of hypo-responsiveness of the HPA axis to stress or “relative adrenal insufficiency.”1, 2 There have also been reports demonstrating early adrenal insufficiency by ACTH stimulation testing in premature infants who later develop BPD. Adrenal insufficiency has been reported in the setting of septic shock.

2. Early studies suggested that extremely low birth weight infants treated prophylactically with hydrocortisone may be at lower risk for BPD. A prospective, multicenter study of prophylactic hydrocortisone to prevent BPD was stopped early due to increased non-NEC intestinal perforation among the treated infants; this complication was likely due to an interaction between hydrocortisone and Indomethacin8. Analysis from that study and others showed that the half-life of hydrocortisone is longer in the term and pre-term infant than had previously been assumed. A Cochrane systematic review to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of corticosteroids used either as primary treatment for hypotension or for refractory hypotension in preterm infants found that “hydrocortisone may be as effective as dopamine when used as a primary treatment for hypotension9 .... Steroids are effective in treatment of refractory hypotension in preterm infants without an increase in short term adverse consequences. However, long term safety or benefit data is lacking.”

3. Since that time, the PREMILOC randomized controlled trial of routine low dose hydrocortisone initiated by 24 hours for extremely preterm infants has been completed and published, which enrolled 523 infants (256 assigned to hydrocortisone)10. The primary outcome was survival without BPD, but this trial has provided substantial additional information which has informed initial management decisions for this high-risk group and may change the landscape of observed hypotension in our nurseries (see below).

4. Which patients are likely at highest risk for adrenal insufficiency?

<a id='6597f451-9895-49f2-8d46-c4102255b37f'></a>

a. Extremely low birth weight, extremely premature infants; however, premature infants of more advanced gestational age may also demonstrate signs consistent with adrenal insufficiency, particularly in period of substantial stress.
b. Infants with clinical signs of adrenal insufficiency such as substantial BP instability requiring dopamine >10 mcg/kg/min or epinephrine at any dose AND volume boluses >20 ml/kg in 2 hrs or >30 ml/kg over 6 hrs. The patient should also have exhibited other signs of severe illness including requirement for intubation and mechanical ventilation with need for increased FIO2, and poor perfusion and urine output.

<a id='4c57f196-02ad-4f5a-93ee-5304303509ad'></a>

B. PREMILOC routine hydrocortisone for <28 week EGA infants: How does hydrocortisone for hypotension with suspected adrenal insufficiency fit in?

1.  The PREMILOC trial (Baud O, et al, 2016) was a double-blind, RCT done at 21 French tertiary-care NICUs that randomized infants 24+0/7 week – 27+6/7 weeks EGA to receive either intravenous low-dose hydrocortisone or placebo during the first 10 postnatal days. The primary outcome, survival without BPD, was significantly improved in the treatment group (OR 1.48, 95%CI 1.02-2.16) with NNT =12. Complications and short term morbidities for the group overall were not significantly different, although subgroup analysis demonstrated higher rates of late sepsis in the 24-25 week GA group. Follow up at 2 years (80% FU) revealed no differences in neurodevelopmental outcomes or respiratory outcomes by treatment group (Baud O, et al, 2017).
2.  The Stanford Neonatology Division has determined that the risk/benefit warrants routine initiation of the **PREMILOC treatment protocol for infants in our care born at <28 weeks GA**. The criteria and treatment protocol are as follows (see also NEST chapter of this edition of the NICU Guide for further details):
    a. Inclusion criteria:
        Infants < 28 weeks in the first week of life should receive:
        0.5mg/kg q12 x 7 days
        0.5mg/kg q24 x 3 days
    b. Exclusion criteria:
        SGA (<3rd %ile weight for GA)
        NSAID initiated within the first 24 hours
3.  Given that low dose hydrocortisone will be routinely administered to extremely preterm infants with PREMILOC protocol, it is anticipated that early, severe refractory hypotension due to adrenal insufficiency be reduced substantially in this group. However, initiation or adjustment of hydrocortisone for hypotension due to suspected adrenal insufficiency may be considered by the attending neonatologist in settings including but not limited to the following:
    a. If the infant is ≥ 28 +0/7 weeks, and therefore not on the PREMILOC protocol.
    b. If the infant is already on PREMILOC hydrocortisone dosing but has hypotension unresponsive to inotropic support and appropriate volume expansion (if hypovolemic), the attending neonatologist may consider adjusting the dosing/weaning schedule, or in rare case, increasing the dose of hydrocortisone after first considering a 1 mg/kg test dose.
    c. If the infant is outside the postnatal period of PREMILOC protocol (i.e., transferred in later, or after the 10-day treatment period, etc.) but has severe refractory hypotension suspected to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.

C. Suggested guidelines for hydrocortisone initiation for hypotension in setting of suspected adrenal hypotension for non-PREMILOC Indiciation:

1.  Once the care team has determined that hydrocortisone therapy for hypotension is clinically indicated, a decision regarding dose and weaning will be required. Unfortunately, the **"appropriate" or "best" dosing and weaning schedule to address hypotension for suspected adrenal insufficiency is not known**. The broad goal is to provide the lowest dose of hydrocortisone required, and wean off the hydrocortisone as quickly as appropriate to avoid suppression of the HPA axis.

    Because the "appropriate" or "adequate" adrenal response to cosyntropin or to stress in the newborn is not definitively known, **cosyntropin stimulation testing is NOT routinely recommended prior to initiation of hydrocortisone in this setting**.

    With these points in mind, and with the concept that little data exist from which to develop treatment algorithms, several **guidelines** for dosing and weaning have been suggested, including a recently published algorithm by Watterberg7. The following is a guideline for **preterm infants <34 weeks EGA**, based on best available experience and evidence, with a schedule tailored to attempt to balance goals of therapy with safety and quality considerations.

    a. Consider a **"test dose"**: Depending on the severity of the initial presentation, the care team may choose to start with a single, higher "test dose" of hydrocortisone of **1 mg/kg**. If no response in cardiovascular stability is noted subsequent to this dose, the care team may consider that further dosing is not indicated. If response is noted, subsequent dosing as below is suggested.

    b. A 5-day weaning course, beginning with **0.5 mg/kg/dose**.

        i. Hydrocortisone, 0.5 mg/kg IV every 12 hrs x 48 hours (4 doses), then:

        ii. Hydrocortisone, 0.3 mg/kg IV every 12 hrs x 48 hours (4 doses), then:

        iii. Hydrocortisone, 0.2 mg/kg IV every 12 hrs x 24 hours (2 doses).

<a id='efafdf6d-7e50-45db-a6ac-6d1bc62af79f'></a>

** The care team may implement a more aggressive hydrocortisone wean or discontinue the drug altogether if
side effects occur, or if signs of severe adrenal insufficiency have substantially improved. As noted above, in
the setting of refractory hypotension during the PREMILOC protocol treatment period the attending
neonatologist also may consider adjusting dosing/weaning schedule.

<a id='52b0e8a8-63e9-4870-8a12-4598c36cf7bf'></a>

**NOTE:** Due to gestational age-based differences in hydrocortisone half life suggested by available evidence, dosing interval should be q 6-8 hours for infants > or = 34 weeks, with number of doses at each step revised to maintain period on dose. HOWEVER, data regarding half life are not robust, and dosing interval may need to be individualized, guided by cardiovascular response.

<a id='95abf9b4-32a8-41d7-a268-28d2c2bfa8e5'></a>

** For infants who become ill during a hydrocortisone wean or require surgery, _consider_ increasing transiently to a higher dose (more closely approximate stress dosing). The care team may also consider involving Pediatric Endocrinology for consultation at this point.

<a id='542dcb6b-cb30-44f2-9cbc-8c0c50bcaccf'></a>

2. Monitor for possible side effects:
   a. Check dextrose stick every 8 hrs.
   b. Check blood pressure every hour or continuously if arterial access (recommended).
   c. Hydrocortisone dosing may need to be adjusted if hypertension or hyperglycemia is present

Management of Hypotension with Suspected Adrenal Insufficiency 333
3. A Pediatric Endocrinology consultation should be strongly considered if the patient fails to successfully wean from hydrocortisone, and/or if the patient requires hydrocortisone re-initiation.

<a id='020044e7-8066-4a7a-a956-990fccae4f0a'></a>

4. <u>**If the patient fails to successfully wean from hydrocortisone and/or requires re-initiation of hydrocortisone, adrenal function assessment (cosyntropin stimulation test) should be considered in coordination with Pediatric Endocrinology consultation.**</u> This generally and optimally would occur 2-3 wks after completion of a hydrocortisone course, but a different schedule may be recommended tests by Pediatric Endocrinology, along with other tests.

<a id='a149754a-32e0-41d4-866b-ef62ee3f3eb4'></a>

5. The neonatal cosyntropin test is conducted as follows:

a. Draw baseline cortisol level. Label this as "baseline."

b. Perform cosyntropin stimulation test:

i. Give cosyntropin 3.5 mcg/kg by rapid IV infusion.

ii. Draw another cortisol level 30 min after cosyntropin infusion. Label this as "peak."

<a id='c8f9abfc-41da-4747-9a0f-44eb5cce720a'></a>

D. Are there firm definitions of "adrenal insufficiency"?

1. "Adrenal insufficiency" was defined in previous literature as a peak post-stimulation cortisol level of <15 mcg/dl or change in cortisol level of <9 mcg/dl. However, it is important to note that _this definition pertains only to the values associated with greater risk for developing BPD_. It is **NOT KNOWN** what adrenal response is "sufficient" for an extremely low birth weight infant under substantial physiologic stress.

2. Blood pressure has been _suggested_ to be in "normal" range if the diastolic BP ≥ 20 and MAP > gestational age, but **this is must be considered in light of the accompanying clinical signs**. A mean arterial pressure of less than gestational age may be considered adequate if perfusion, urine output, and other indicators are appropriate.

I. **Background**

A. Appropriate thyroid function is essential for proper fetal and neonatal growth and development. Congenital thyroid hormone deficiency results in intellectual impairment, but if treated early, cognitive development can be normal. Pre- and post-natal maturation of the brain and correct functioning of peripheral nerves are thyroid hormone dependent. Metabolism, glucose absorption, and skeletal maturation are all affected by thyroid function.

B. In the term infant at birth, serum TSH level rises rapidly, then falls in the first 24 hrs. T4 and FT4 demonstrate a "follow-on" increase, gradually falling over 4 wks. Although early studies 1 suggested that a similar, but attenuated pattern occurs in pre-term infants, data from extremely premature infants revealed no substantive rise in TSH and an absence of "follow-on" FT4 or FT3 increase. 2 This suggests that VLBW and very pre-term infants may be quite different from term infants with respect to their thyroid function.

<a id='e293e13e-51b6-4711-8c46-ea12ad85f05a'></a>

II. "Atypical Hypothyroidism" in VLBW and III Neonates

A. Several studies have reported "atypical hypothyroidism," which can be seen in VLBW and extremely ill term infants. Atypical hypothyroidism is described as an initial low T4 level, then a delayed TSH decline with a persistently low T4. These analyses are generally retrospective in nature (using newborn screening databases) or small prospective studies. Most of these studies suggest that the rate of hypothyroidism, particularly atypical hypothyroidism, is substantially increased among VLBW infants. Other neonatal patient groups, such as those with congenital cardiac anomalies, may also be at increased risk for atypical hypothyroidism.

B. The importance of these findings is that early newborn screening alone may not detect potentially significant thyroid function impairment. Only later thyroid function testing will allow for diagnosis of atypical hypothyroidism.

<a id='c2656ca5-4d14-420e-86d2-89bc45f24b5c'></a>

### III. Neurodevelopmental Outcome and Low T4

A. The most important potential consequence of impaired thyroid function is later neurodevelopmental delay. Two frequently cited studies suggest that low T4 alone may be independently associated with poor cognitive and neuromotor outcomes in early and later childhood among preterm, low birth weight infants.

B. Den Ouden, et al.3 found that, as expected, lower T4 levels at birth tracked closely with lower gestational age. In multivariate analyses (adjusted for multiple perinatal and neonatal factors), a lower thyroxine level was an independent risk factor for any handicap or neurologic dysfunction at 5 yrs of age, and for school failure at 9 yrs. Reuss and colleagues4 found that, after adjusting for multiple confounding variables, severe hypothyroxinemia (>2 SD below the mean) significantly increased the odds for disabling cerebral palsy at 2 yrs of age, and reduced Bayley MDI scores by approximately 6.8 points. In a cohort study of ~440 infants < 34 weeks EGA with serial T4 levels at birth, 7, 14, and 28 days in Scotland, hypothyroxinemia was associated with lower McCarthy Scales scores at 5 ½ years5.

C. Nevertheless, a systematic review of randomized controlled trials from the Cochrane Collaborative originally published in 2007 and updated in 20096 found **no evidence that routine, prophylactic thyroid hormone therapy initiated early in the hospital course for preterm VLBW infants decreased morbidities or improved neurodevelopmental outcomes**. The authors concluded that a well-designed, adequately powered trial would be required to further examine the question of early, prophylactic thyroid hormone therapy for preterm infants. Similarly, a systematic review of postnatal thyroid hormone treatment for preterm infants with transient hypothyroxinemia concluded insufficient evidence to determine whether

336 Part II-H: Endocrine
use of thyroid hormones for treatment of preterm infants with transient hypothroxinemia result in changes
in neonatal morbidity and mortality, or reductions in neurodevelopmental impairments

D. A phase I trial of different dosing regimens has been completed. 8 Neurodevelopmental follow up of the
infants was not preplanned, but was organized after the trial was completed. No differences in Bayley III
scores were found between groups, but only 66% (89/134) of the infants were followed to 36 months, and
power was insufficient to detect any but the largest differences in outcomes. 9 A 2012 review again calls
for a randomized trial of thyroid hormone supplementation to determine whether a clinically important
reduction in risk of developmental impairments in extremely low birth weight infants is associated with
supplementation.10

E. Although available studies attempted to adjust for multiple clinical factors, it is possible that low T4 may
simply be a marker for severity of illness. Similarly, an increasing TSH may be a sign of "recovering" thyroid
function, rather than atypical hypothyroidism.

F. Recent consensus guidelines and systematic reviews have underscored that repetitive re-screening should
be strongly considered in VLBW infants 11, 12. **Early diagnosis and treatment of congenital
hypothyroidism is associated with the best possibility for outcome, and it has been recommended to
begin treatment within 4 weeks in cases of definitive diagnosis.** Since preterm infants may not have
stable thyroid profile in the first days, it has been proposed that it would be unwise to delay a first re-
screening to beyond 4 weeks. However, studies of "atypical" hypothyroidism also demonstrate that a later
appearance of hypothyroidism (beyond 4 weeks) can occur, thus an early rescreen only would not assure
capture of all aptients.

## IV. Routine Later Thyroid Function Testing for VLBW Infants

The following protocol has been instituted at LPCH nurseries:

### A. Routine thyroid function testing

1. It seems likely from reports in the literature that a phenomenon of "delayed hypothyroidism" can occur in certain patient groups, including very low birth weight (VLBW) infants and infants with congenital cardiac defects. Although the clinical consequences of such hypothyroidism are not certain, it is clear that newborn screening only would not detect this delayed thyroid function impairment.

2. Therefore, all VLBW infants (birth weight <1500 gm) disease should undergo the following testing:
   a. At 2 weeks of age, free T4 and TSH levels should be obtained.
   b. At 6 weeks of age, free T4 and TSH levels should be obtained.

3. All patients with complex congenital heart should undergo the following testing:
   a. At 6 weeks of age, free T4 and TSH levels should be obtained.

4. If a VLBW infant or patient with complex congenital heart disease is to be discharged or transferred to another hospital PRIOR to 6 weeks: Free T4 and TSH levels should be obtained prior to discharge or transfer, regardless of the age of the patient.

5. A Pediatric Endocrinology consult should be considered in any case of abnormal thyroid function tests. **A high or borderline high TSH in the setting of a low or borderline low T4 should be an absolute trigger for Pediatric Endocrinology consultation.** Pediatric Endocrinology recommendations for both the 2-week and 6-week check are:

Thyroid Function in VLBW Infants 337

a. If TSH is >8—regardless of the free T4 level—call for immediate consult.
b. If the TSH is 6-8 and Free T4 is <0.9ng/dL, consult Endocrinology.
c. If TSH is 6-8 and Free T4 is >0.9, repeat TSH and Free T4 in 1 wk.

<a id='2e93a739-bf1b-4f64-aff3-379d1c610c30'></a>

B. Normal thyroid study ranges for age

1. Please note that the literature reports thyroid study ranges in VARYING units! Be careful when comparing the literature to our lab values!
2. TSH surge at birth lasts 3-5 days. However, there is a 90% probability of congenital hypothyroidism if TSH >50μU/L.

I. **Key Concepts**

A. Genital formation occurs within the first 12 weeks of fetal life. Therefore, ambiguity implies sex steroid abnormalities in the 1st trimester.

B. Testes must be fully functional to develop external male structures and remove internal female structures. Testosterone is locally converted to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) to complete development of the penis and scrotum. Testes must produce Mullerian-inhibiting substance/anti-Mullerian hormone (MIS/AMH) for involution of internal female structures.

C. During the initial evaluation, assume agreement between gender karyotype and gonads. Palpable testes suggest a male baby. However, never assume that non-palpable gonads means absence of testes.

D. Ambiguous genitalia should be addressed as a medical emergency. Appropriate initial steps include consultation with experts in the field and an evaluation focused on identifying causes of ambiguous genitalia that are associated with glucocorticoid (cortisol) deficiency and salt-losing crisis (occurs in the first 4–15 days of life).

II. **Main Categories**

A. 46 XX DSD: Virilization of 46 XX female infant

1. Etiology

a. Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia

i. 21-hydroxylase deficiency (Na+ wasting, most common etiology).
ii. 11b-hydroxylase deficiency (possible Na+ wasting; may have hypertension).
iii. 3b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency.

b. Adrenal virilizing tumor (fetus or mother)

c. Gestational hyperandrogenism

iv. Placental-fetal aromatase deficiency.
v. Maternal exposure synthetic androgens.

2. Physical exam

a. Posterior labial fusion

i. Most sensitive sign of virilization in the first trimester.
ii. Anogenital ratio - distance between the anus and posterior fourchette divided by the distance between the anus and the base of the clitoris (normal ratio <0.5).

b. Clitoromegaly - indicates virilization at any time during pregnancy.

340 Part II-H: Endocrine
i. Normal clitoral length < 6 mm in term female infant.

<a id='0c0d41ca-055e-4811-933a-6e3183f06ff2'></a>

c. Rugation and pigmentation of the labia majora.
B. **46 XY DSD**: Undervirilization of 46 XY male infant

<a id='da61a677-f4fd-4995-a73c-c6c884d8e6c5'></a>

1.  Etiology
    a.  Complete or partial androgen insensitivity
    b.  5-alpha-reductase deficiency
    c.  Testosterone biosynthetic defects
        i.  3b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency
        ii. 17b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency
        iii. 17a hydroxylase/17, 20-lyase deficiency
        iv. StAR (Steroidogenic Acute Regulatory) protein deficiency (*21-hydroxylase and 11b- hydroxylase deficiency cause overvirilization, and therefore do not lead to ambiguous genitalia in a male infant)
    d.  Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome
    e.  Leydig cell hypoplasia or agenesis due to LH receptor resistance
    f.  Testicular Regression Syndrome or congenital anorchia
    g.  Non-hormonal isolated structural defects (e.g., more common with IVF pregnancy)

2. Physical exam

<a id='76fefc4e-1a8e-4eac-8936-2b1ba785c94d'></a>

a. Microphallus
   i. Normal penile length >2.5 cm in term infant.
   ii. Indicates insufficient testosterone production at anytime during pregnancy. For example, gonadotropin deficiency in the 2nd or 3rd trimester can lead to isolated microphallus. Isolated microphallus is _not_ ambiguous if it is a normally formed penile structure without hypospadias and with palpable testes
   iii. In cases with microphallus, consider panhypopituitarism. Growth hormone is synergistic with testosterone during the last trimester to increase phallus length, so a deficiency can cause a microphallus and even hypoglycemia.
b. Bifid scrotum or penoscrotal transposition
c. Hypospadias
   i. Isolated first or second-degree hypospadias is not ambiguous if there is a normally formed penis with palpable testes

Disorders of Sexual Differentiation 341

d. Cryptorchidism (isolated hypospadias and cryptorchidism may occur independent of virilization defects). If bilateral, then severely virilized female with CAH should be considered.

C. Sex Chromosome DSD /Mixed sex chromosome patterns:

1.  Etiology and physical exam findings
    a. Sex Chromosome DSD
        i. Turner Syndrome (45 XO, normal external genitalia)
        ii. Klinefelter Syndrome (47 XXY, normal external genitalia)
        iii. Mixed gonadal dysgenesis
            a) 16 XY or 45 XO/46 XY mosaic (asymmetric external genitalia with spectrum of internal structures from male, to mix, to female)
        iv. "True hermaphroditism"
            a) Ovarian and testicular tissue must be present - diagnosed on gonadal biopsy
            b) Generally, 46 XX karyotype

        i. Heterogeneous entity
        ii. Duplication of DAX-1 or WNT-4 gene results in sex reversal
        iii. Mutation in SRY, SOX9, SF-1, WT-1 may result in complete sex reversal or spectrum of ambiguity with partial dysgenesis
