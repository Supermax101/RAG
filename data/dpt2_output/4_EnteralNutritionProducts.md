# POLYMERIC FORMULAS

*   Sometimes referred to as "standard" formulas

*   Require ability to digest and absorb macronutrients
*   Come in a variety of concentrations
    *   1-2 kcal/mL
*   Also available with and without fiber

## SEMI-ELEMENTAL FORMULAS

- Protein is either partially or completely hydrolyzed
  - Protein source is typically small peptides
  - CHO may be partially hydrolyzed (e.g., maltodextrin or hydrolyzed corn starch)
  - Fat content is modified
    - May be primarily medium chain triglycerides
    - May be lower in fat than standard formulas
  - Also come in a variety of concentrations
    - 1-1.5 kcal/mL

## DEFINED DIET/ELEMENTAL FORMULAS

*   Protein is completely hydrolyzed – free amino acids
*   CHO is partially hydrolyzed (e.g., maltodextrin or hydrolyzed corn starch)
*   Fat content is modified
    *   May be primarily medium chain triglycerides
    *   May be lower in fat than standard formulas
*   Generally 1 kcal/mL; some powdered formulas may be able to reconstituted to concentrate the formula slightly, but need to be cautious with this approach to avoid a viscous formula that may clog the enteral feeding tube

* There are some that are a combination of CHO and fat to provide more calories
* Available in powder or liquid form
* Often given as a bolus supplement to an EN regimen, but may be mixed with an enteral product

    *   If frequent, may want to supplement anyway
*   In critically ill patients, antioxidant supplementation may be beneficial

E. Selection of Appropriate Enteral
Formulation

Question: Which formula should be used when initiating
EN in the critically ill patient?

E1. Based on expert consensus, we suggest using a
standard polymeric formula when initiating EN in the
ICU setting. We suggest avoiding the routine use of all
specialty formulas in critically ill patients in a MICU
and disease-specific formulas in the SICU.

DECIDING WHEN TO USE A
SPECIALIZED FORMULA

*   Mr. Smith is a 67 year old man who was admitted with heart failure and was intubated. He was diuresed and able to extubate, but unfortunately, required reintubation within 24 hours because of pulmonary edema. The team would like to start EN today.

*   What would be the best formula to start with?

DECIDING WHEN TO USE A SPECIALIZED FORMULA

<a id='33ca25fe-681c-48dd-8b19-21f2b36c257a'></a>

• This is a case where a specialized formula is not necessary
• A more concentrated standard formula would be appropriate to restrict volume
• Pulmonary-specific formulas have not been shown to have significant benefit, and are designed for COPD
  – Mr. Smith developed respiratory failure because of volume overload

I. Pulmonary Failure
Question: What is the optimal carbohydrate/fat ratio for the adult ICU patient with pulmonary failure?

11. We suggest that specialty high-fat/low-carbohydrate formulations designed to manipulate the respiratory quotient and reduce CO₂ production not be used in ICU patients with acute respiratory failure (not to be confused with recommendation E3).
[Quality of Evidence: Very Low]

Question: Does use of energy-dense EN formulas to restrict fluid administration benefit the adult ICU patient with acute respiratory failure?

12. Based on expert consensus, we suggest that fluid-restricted energy-dense EN formulations be considered for patients with acute respiratory failure (especially if in a state of volume overload).

## J. Renal Failure

*Question:* In adult critically ill patients with acute kidney injury (AKI), what are the indications for use of specialty enteral formulations? What are appropriate energy and protein recommendations to reduce morbidity in AKI?

**J1.** Based on expert consensus, we suggest that ICU patients with acute renal failure (ARF) or AKI be placed on a standard enteral formulation and that standard ICU recommendations for protein (1.2–2 g/kg actual body weight per day) and energy (25–30 kcal/kg/d) provision should be followed. If significant electrolyte abnormalities develop, a specialty formulation designed for renal failure (with appropriate electrolyte profile) may be considered.

## DECIDING WHEN TO USE A SPECIALIZED FORMULA

*   Yes, this would be a time to change to a renal-specific formula to restrict potassium and he may also need a phosphorus restriction if his AKI worsens
*   If Mr. Smith starts CRRT, he may be able to change back to a standard formula
    *   CRRT is generally very effective in removing electrolytes
    *   A standard formula may help maintain normal electrolyte status, which is especially important if there is a product shortage of potassium or phosphorus

Question: Is a disease-specific enteral formulation needed for critically ill patients with liver disease?

**K3.** Based on expert consensus, we suggest that standard enteral formulations be used in ICU patients with acute and chronic liver disease. There is no evidence of further benefit of branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) formulations on coma grade in the ICU patient with encephalopathy who is already receiving first-line therapy with luminal-acting antibiotics and lactulose.

## M. Surgical Subsets

### Trauma

Question: Does the nutrition therapy approach for the trauma patient differ from that for other critically ill patients?

M1a. We suggest that, similar to other critically ill patients, early enteral feeding with a high protein polymeric diet be initiated in the immediate posttrauma period (within 24–48 hours of injury) once the patient is hemodynamically stable.

[Quality of Evidence: Very Low]
