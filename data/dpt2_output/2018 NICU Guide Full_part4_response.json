Actual oxygen delivery to the infant with vary depending on flow and mixing with inspired room air. For example, the infant receiving 0.1 LPM at 100% is likely receiving oxygen delivery in the 25-30% range. As flow increases, delivery of oxygen increases.\n\n<a id='2eb75856-793d-496a-817f-b0119476f289'></a>\n\n3. **Weaning of Nasal Cannula**\n\nA. HFNC\n\n1.  Wean FiO2 first. When FiO2 < 30%, wean flow\n2.  Wean by 1-2 LPM increments when FiO2 < 30%, SpO2 > 90%, pCO2 in recommended range and no significant respiratory distress\n3.  Wean from HFNC to LFNC at flows of 2-3 LPM (there is no evidence that flows < 4 LPM are efficacious).\n\nB. LFNC\n\n1.  Wean flow as tolerated per oximetry parameters and clinical work of breathing.\n2.  **Wean flow first before weaning FiO2 to avoid confusion.**\n3.  Decrease flow from 0.5 to 0.1 LPM\n4.  If an infant needs more than 0.5 LPM with 100% FiO2, consider HFNC or CPAP\n5.  When infants are discharged on LFNC, flow can be set at 0.1-0.25 LPM, 100% FiO2\n\nC. Weaning example: Infant on HFNC, 3 LPM, 25% FiO2.\n\n1.  Infant on HFNC, 3 LPM, 25% FiO2.\n2.  Wean to LFNC, 100% FiO2 and adjust flow from 0.1-0.5 LPM to meet saturation goals\n3.

Elevated pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary arterial pressure in conjunction with pulmonary vasoreactivity characterize PPHN. This produces right-to-left shunting at the PDA and PFO. It results in hypoxemia from extra-pulmonary shunting which can be poorly responsive to medical management. PPHN is felt to represent failure of the pulmonary circulation to adapt to post-natal conditions and as such is sometimes called “persistent fetal circulation”. The pulmonary vascular bed is abnormal with extension of the medial smooth muscle layer into the smaller and more peripheral intraacinar vessels.\n\n<a id='064f59ea-1c25-4946-9422-fe55ff818ef9'></a>\n\nII. **PPHN Occurs in Several Settings**\n\nA. **Idiopathic:** Idiopathic PPHN occurs when there is abnormally constricted pulmonary vasculature without parenchymal lung disease. Clinical presentation is hypoxemia that is out of proportion to the degree of parenchymal lung disease. It has been called \"black-lung\" PPHN, due to the lack of pulmonary vascular markings on chest radiograph.\n\nB. **Parenchymal lung disease:** PPHN frequently accompanies meconium aspiration syndrome, respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis and/or pneumonia. In these settings, evidence of PPHN is seen in addition to intra-pulmonary shunting from parenchymal lung disease.\n\nC. **Lung hypoplasia:** Lung hypoplasia can be seen with congenital diaphragmatic hernia and in infants with premature prolonged rupture of the membranes and longstanding oligohydramnios. In these conditions, lung growth and development are affected and there is a variable degree of lung hypoplasia. This results in a decrease in the cross-sectional area of the pulmonary vascular bed, with subsequent pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary vasoconstriction.\n\nD. **Rare, fatal conditions:** Respiratory failure and PPHN can be the presenting features in Surfactant Protein B (SPB) deficiency, alveolar capillary dysplasia (ACD), and lymphangiectasia.\n\n<a id='14e58d73-8961-4a57-b70e-9fb5dcf9e6a6'></a>\n\n### III. Treatment\n\nA. **Identify infants** at risk for PPHN: Infants with meconium in the amniotic fluid should be monitored with pulse oximetry following birth. Infants at risk for PPHN should be monitored for signs of respiratory distress and desaturation. UAC placement should be considered in infants at risk of PPHN who have respiratory distress. Differential pre/post-ductal saturations reflect shunting at the ductal level. Hypoxemia in PPHN is typically labile and not fixed as it is in cyanotic congenital heart disease. ECHO is the best method to evaluate for PPHN and rule-out congenital heart disease.\n\nB. Promptly treat hypoxemia and acidosis: Hypoxemia and acidosis increase pulmonary vascular resistance and should be promptly addressed.\n\nC. Assure adequate cardiac output by maintaining a mean arterial pressure >45 in a term or near-term infant. This may be achieved with a combination of either volume boluses or pressors. Dopamine is the first line drug. ECHO can evaluate right and left heart function and guide management of blood pressure. Central arterial and venous pressure monitoring is desirable to guide therapy.\n\nD. Maintain adequate oxygen carrying capacity by keeping the hematocrit between 40 and 50. Hematocrits in\n\n<a id='21eb4d0f-e222-439c-a126-e75171347b0e'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Intubation and mechanical ventilation for infants with continued instability of oxygenation: Both hypo and hyperinflation may increase PVR. Gentle ventilation strategies should be used to minimize iatrogenic lung injury. Goal lung expansion is 8-9 ribs.\n\nF. If there is evidence of pulmonary hypertension clinically or on ECHO, the suggested target ABGs are: pH 7.35-7.45, PaCO2 35-50 and PaO2 60-80. PaCO2 values under 35 will decrease cerebral blood flow and increase the risk for brain injury. Hyperventilation and alkalinization may negatively impact cerebral perfusion and increase the risk of sensorineural hearing loss. Avoid using 100% oxygen, goal preductal saturation is > 92 - 95%. In certain patients such as those with CDH, post-ductal saturations in the 70s – 80s may be tolerated if serum lactate is < 3 and there is adequate urine output. Consider use of NIRS in this patient population to monitor for cerebral vasoconstriction. High frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) may be considered to achieve the above blood gas targets.\n\nG. Minimize stress by reducing unnecessary handling and noise.\n\nH. Assure appropriate sedation and analgesia. The drugs of choice are morphine and versed given as continuous infusions. Neuromuscular blockade should be considered if oxygenation remains problematic after other therapeutic approaches have been used.\n\nI. Calculate the oxygenation index (OI) for all infants with oxygen requirement ≥ 60%:\n\nOI = MAP x 100 x FiO2\n     ----------\n       PaO2\n\n<a id='5c9392d0-0014-46f9-9496-f88356921c97'></a>\n\nIV. Maximal Medical Therapy Alternatives\n\nA. **High frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV)**: HFOV should be considered when PIP is > 25-28 or tidal volume of more than 6ml/kg is needed to maintain CO2 < 60 or if OI >10.\n\nB. **Surfactant therapy**: Surfactant should be considered in patients with parenchymal lung disease and when OI ≥15. Infants with lung injury and respiratory failure may have a secondary surfactant deficiency. A masked randomized trial reported a significant reduction in the need for ECMO with surfactant therapy. Subgroup analysis showed the greatest benefit in the group with OI 15-22. Consider using a test dose in unstable infants.\n\nC. **Inhaled nitric oxide therapy (iNO)**: See section V\n\nD. **ECMO**: See NICU Guide Section II:B\n\nE. **Milrinone**: Milrinone increases cardiac output and lowers systemic vascular resistance as well as pulmonary vascular resistance. It can be used in PPHN when blood pressure is normal and there is good cardiac function. In neonates with low blood pressure and poor cardiac function milrinone can be used in conjunction with other vasoactive agents.\n\n<a id='7df4a75b-a3ad-408f-9820-336636a88bb2'></a>\n\nV. Inhaled Nitric Oxide\n\nA. Background\n\n1. Nitric oxide is a regulator of vascular tone, endogenously produced by the vascular endothelium. Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) therapy causes selective pulmonary vasodilation in animal models and humans. Multicenter randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that iNO significantly improves oxygenation and reduces the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in term and near-term infants with hypoxic respiratory failure and persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). iNO is FDA\n\n<a id='b05bd8cd-6100-4c15-8055-9850cb09b4f2'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Indications\n\n1. Gestational age ≥34 wks.\n2. Mechanical ventilation with an Ol ≥25 on 2 ABGs at least 15 min apart. Use of iNO with Ol ≥25 has been shown to decrease ECMO/death.\n3. There is some recent literature suggesting that iNO initiation with an Ol ≥ 15-25 results in decreased progression to Ol >30 (P=0.002) and a 41% reduction in the rate of ECMO or death. The effect on ECMO/death was not statistically significant, but may be clinically important.\n4. Attending physician approval.\n\n<a id='d5674e0f-9529-4cd1-a565-3ddd51af5448'></a>\n\nC. Administration, Dosing, and Weaning Strategies for iNO in the Term Infant\n\n1.  Nitric Oxide Dosing Strategy - Refer to algorithm (see figure).\n2.  Acute Deterioration During Initial Dosing - If the patient experiences a significant deterioration during initial dosing requiring a change in vent settings or performance of a procedure (e.g., chest tube placement), iNO use should be discontinued and initial dosing repeated once the patient has stabilized.\n3.  Exit Criteria\n    a. NO2 levels >5 ppm.\n    b. Methemoglobin levels >10%.\n    c. Deterioration in patient's condition felt to be related to iNO therapy.\n4.  Toxicity - Toxicity related to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) formation and methemoglobinemia (metHb) is rare but important side effects of iNO use. NO2 formation occurs when NO and oxygen are combined in the ventilator circuit. NO2 is measured by the iNOvent continuously. Methemoglobinemia occurs when there is a deficiency or relative deficiency of the enzyme methemoglobin reductase or if high doses of iNO are administered.\n    a. If NO2 ≥3 ppm, wean by 50% (if ≤5 ppm iNO then decrease by 1 ppm) every 15 min until NO2 <3 ppm.\n    b. If NO2 levels >5 ppm, discontinue iNO therapy. If metHb ≥5%, wean by 50% (if ≤5 ppm iNO decrease by 1 ppm) every 15 min until MetHb <5%.\n    c. If metHb levels >10%, discontinue iNO therapy.\n\n<a id='8be962fd-e6bf-405c-994a-c91ba5edab7f'></a>\n\nD. Weaning\n\n1. Baseline refers to pre-wean ABG drawn <15 min before change.\n2. First wean performed 6 ±2 hrs following initiation.\n3. Subsequent weans every 4 ±2 hrs if Ol ≤10 or every 6 ±2 hrs if Ol >10.\n\n<a id='0fa0e9d3-06ab-43cc-942e-0e44a955b166'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Nitric oxide is weaned as follows: 20 → 10 → 5 → 4 → 3 → 2 → 1 → 0 ppm\n5. ABG timing: baseline before wean, then 30 min after. No vent/FiO2 changes during wean attempt.\n6. If pre-wean PaO2 ≥100, wean successful if PaO2 falls by ≤35% and PaO2 >60.\n7. If pre-wean PaO2 <100, wean successful if PaO2 falls by ≤20% and PaO2 >60.\n8. If pre-wean PaO2 <60, wean successful if decrease in PaO2 ≤10% from baseline.\n\n<a id='6c3df2b5-037b-41fd-ab81-b23138d683d4'></a>\n\nE. Escalation\n\n1. Recommended maximum iNO dose is 20 ppm.\n2. Deterioration in oxygenation is defined as PaO2 < 50 and/or decrease in PaO2 >10% from last successful post-wean ABG. iNO dose should be doubled and ABG obtained in 30 min (if <5 ppm, increase to 5 ppm).\n3. Escalation continues until a full response (>20 Torr) is achieved.\n4. If only a partial response (10-20 Torr), then return to the lowest iNO dose that resulted in a partial response.\n5. If less than a partial response is achieved, then return to pre-escalation iNO dose.\n\n<a id='28afab28-da17-4a6e-bf21-ff42b61696d3'></a>\n\nF. Re-Initiation\n\n1. Recommended cumulative iNO administration is 336 hrs (14 days).\n2. Reinitiation is possible if patient meets original eligibility requirements again, after a successful wean off.\n3. iNO is restarted at 1 ppm (ABG after 30 min) looking for a full response.\n4. If there is not a full response, then return to the iNO initiation flow algorithm using the pre-initiation ABG as baseline ABG.\n\n<a id='48bbcf81-52fa-4f5d-a9b5-23da8ad80ea3'></a>\n\nG.

Other Uses of iNO Therapy\n\n1.  **Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH)**: Prospective randomized controlled trials of iNO for CDH have failed to show reduced need for ECMO or reduced mortality. iNO is, nonetheless, used in CDH patients with refractory hypoxemia prior to ECMO as a rescue therapy. It has been shown to be helpful in the CDH patients post-repair. In addition, some CDH patients have prolonged pulmonary hypertension despite improvements in respiratory support requirements. These patients may benefit from long-term, low-dose nitric oxide, which may even be delivered by nasal cannula if mechanical ventilation is no longer required. Serial echocardiograms, assessing changes in pulmonary hypertension, should be used to assist in the management of these complex patients.\n\n2.  **Cardiac indications**: iNO has been used for pulmonary hypertension related to cardiac anomalies, particularly in the post-operative phase. Few published data exist regarding outcome, although iNO has been reported to reduce pulmonary artery pressure and possibly reduce the need for ECMO.\n\n3.  **iNO for preterm infants**: Trials in premature infants have been categorized as follows: Early rescue (use in critically ill premature infant unresponsive to surfactant), early prophylactic use (routine use in intubated premature infants), and later use for BPD prevention (use in infants remaining intubated after a week of life).\n\n    a.  Early Rescue use: There were several trials in critically ill infants after birth and the Cochrane meta-analysis showed no benefit on BPD or death. 5 The NICHD Preemie iNO trial6 was the largest in this category and results are as follows:\n\n        i.  No benefit to survival or in reduction of rate of physiologic BPD in infants with severe RDS.\n\n        ii. Subgroup analysis suggested that infants >1000 gm may benefit in terms of the outcome of death or BPD however infants ≤1000 g had higher mortality and increased rates of severe IVH.\n\n        iii. However, neurodevelopment follow-up from this trial showed no benefit from iNO exposure on death, neurodevelopmental impairment or neurodevelopmental outcomes in early childhood among the severely ill premature infants in this trial. An increased risk of death or moderate-sever cerebral palsy (CP) moderate-severe CP was seen among survivors given iNO.\n\n    b.  Early prophylactic use: Three large trials were completed in this subgroup. A single center study by Schreiber showed a significant reduction in BPD and death; however, this was not reproduced in two subsequent large trials.\n\n    c.  Later use for BPD prevention: One large RCT enrolled newborns between 7 and 21 days of life if they remained intubated or on CPAP and treated them for a minimum of 24 days with iNO. Results found improved survival without BPD. An industry sponsored study was performed to confirm these results and no benefit was seen. This study has not yet been published, but the results were presented at Hot Topics in 2013. Of interest, sub-group analysis found evidence of benefit in black population which has biologic plausibility due to differences in bioavailability of NO in persons who self-identify as black.\n\n    d.  An individual patient data meta-analysis, NIH Consensus Conference statement and AAP Committee on Fetus and Newborn do NOT recommend iNO for routine use in premature infants. iNO has not been consistently shown to be effective in reducing rates of BPD or death.\n\n    e.  Of note, the NIH Consensus Conference statement recognized that there are specific clinical situations, and subgroup and post-hoc study findings that point to a potential iNO benefit among preterm infants. One such group is premature infants with PPROM. oligohydramnios, pulmonary hypoplasia and likely pulmonary hypertension. Several case studies have suggested benefit and a sub-group analysis from the NICHD Preemie iNO trial showed positive effects on oxygenation, BPD\n\n<a id='4b46cff8-eebd-4909-b9a1-8288b9b9a044'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Infants with Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH) who have respiratory distress from birth often have significant mortality despite aggressive medical intervention.\n\nB. The past approach to the patient with CDH utilized hyperventilation, alkalinization, and high mean airway pressures to treat the pulmonary hypoplasia and Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension of the Newborn (PPHN) associated with CDH. These therapies can result in barotrauma and air leak, and may cause iatrogenic lung injury resulting in a higher need for ECMO and lower survival.\n\nC. Severity of CDH can be estimated using antenatal US and MRI. Lung-to-Head Ratio (LHR) and Observed- to- Expected (O/E) LHR are strong predictors of outcome. LHR is determined by the area of the contralateral lung at the level of the four-chamber view of the heart compared to head circumference. LHR is influenced by\n\nGestational age (GA) and is most predictive at 24-34 weeks. An LHR < 1 carries a poor prognosis and cases can be referred for fetal intervention, an LHR of 1-1.4 carries a high risk of ECMO, and an LHR >1.4 carries the best prognosis. Calculation of the O/E LHR incorporates the expected lung volume for GA and thus can be helpful in prognosis regardless of GA at the time of measurement. O/E LHR < 25% is associated with survival rate of < 25%, an O/E LHR of 26-45% is considered moderate risk with survival between 30-60% dependent on liver position, and an O/E LHR > 45% is considered mild. Liver position is an important predictor of outcome with herniation 'up' into the thorax correlating with worse prognosis\n\n<a id='61991d27-9771-4e00-bcab-7e8dbdb8e0cc'></a>\n\n## **II. Current Management of Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia**\n\nSince first suggested by Wung, et al, many centers have used \"gentle” ventilation strategies with permissive hypercapnia for critically ill CDH infants. This group reported on the use of this approach in 120 infants with severe CDH; the overall survival was 75.8%, with ECMO needed in only 13.3%. The goal is to avoid lung injury, maintain pre-ductal oxygen saturation >85%, and tolerate moderate hypercapnia as long as the pH is >7.20. Protocolized care for CDH has been shown to improve both morbidity and mortality, as was demonstrated in a publication on a standardized management guideline for CDH by a group of European investigators. The following guidelines have been developed from our own practices and outcomes over the last 25 years as well as from a review of the literature.\n\n<a id='5985efbd-bda0-4dd7-bbf7-4087811cdc4b'></a>\n\n### III. Delivery Room Management\n\nA. Intubate immediately. Initiate resuscitation with FiO2 of 50%; ventilate with a PIP 20-24, PEEP 3-5, Rate 40-80; may require a rate as high as 100, especially if chest wall excursion is poor. Goal pre-ductal saturations during resuscitation: 80-95% but may tolerate > 70% for 1 hour post-birth to avoid using high pressures.\nB. Avoid bag mask ventilation to minimize air entry and dilation of intra-thoracic bowel.\nC. Place OG/replogle tube.\nD. Transfer to NICU once stablilized in the DR.\n\n<a id='300d44d9-8322-4e84-bb34-d0e0e2523f28'></a>\n\nIV. **Initial NICU Management**\n\nA. Place pre-ductal saturation monitor.\n\n1. Respiratory management is to be guided by the pre-ductal saturations.\n\n<a id='404d5859-fa1c-4911-8dbf-5b6c6395e5a1'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Goal pre-ductal saturation is >70% in first hour of life and >85-95% thereafter.\n\n<a id='7fb4acfb-e1ba-4cc2-8ebb-335d00729e66'></a>\n\nB. Place UAC or right radial arterial line and UVC or double lumen PICC.\nC. Place Replogle tube to suction.\nD. Obtain CXR to help guide respiratory management.\nE. Respiratory Management\n    1. Conventional Ventilation (PC/SIMV) should be used before HFOV. Initial management with conventional ventilation may reduce ventilation days and need for ECMO, although has not been shown to impact mortality and/or BPD.\n    2. **Blood Gas Goals: pH >7.20, PaCO2 50-70, PaO2 >30; Lactic acid < 3.**\n    3. Ventilate with **lowest PIP** (usually 20-24 mmHg) to provide adequate BS, PEEP of 3-5 mmHg, with rate 40-80 and FiO2 starting at 50%. Titrate FiO2 using pre-ductal saturation monitor.\n    4. Surfactant should not be routinely used in term or preterm neonates with CDH. In preterm neonates, there was a trend towards increased mortality in those treated with surfactant.\nF. High frequency oscillatory ventilation should be considered in infants who fail conventional ventilation.\n    1. Failure of conventional ventilation = inability to control CO2 with a max PIP of 25 and rate of 60 or inability to maintain oxygenation with PIP of 25 and PEEP of 5.\n    2. Initial Paw should be 2 above that on conventional ventilation but not > 15; Amplitude may be 2x Paw or greater in order to achieve adequate wiggle; Frequency 8-10 Hz; Goal expansion of non-hypoplastic lung of 8-9 ribs.\nG. Blood Pressure Management\nGoal is to maintain the arterial blood pressure at normal level for gestational age and appropriate end organ perfusion.\n    1. NS bolus of 10-20 ml/kg for hypotension or poor perfusion. May be repeated x1 prior to starting inotropic agent. Do not administer more than 40ml/kg of crystalloid.\n    2. Initiate Dopamine at 3 mcg/kg/min following crystalloid boluses. Titrate Dopamine to keep MAP at or above gestational age in weeks.\n    3. Consider Hydrocortisone if blood pressure does not improve with appropriate doses of Dopamine.\nH. Sedatives or analgesics should be initiated either in DR (during a prolonged resuscitation) or upon arrival to NICU.\n    1. Provide pain relief with Morphine 0.05-0.1mg/kg q 6 hrs and **lightly** sedate with continuous drip of Midazolam (start at lowest dose).\nI. Place NIRS monitor (cerebral and renal)\nJ. Obtain ECHO within 24 hours after birth. ECHO will evaluate for cardiac anomalies (present in about 25% of CDH patients), heart function, and severity of pulmonary hypertension.\n\n<a id='832a2db3-6888-43d0-921a-e7b60a1ca915'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Consult the following services: Pediatric Surgery, Cardiology and Genetics (additional congenital anomalies are present in 10-40% of CDH patients)\n\n<a id='efc0c881-5556-4757-8075-39e5314286ec'></a>\n\nV. **Management of the Critically-ill CDH Infant**\n\nA. The focus is to tolerate marginal pulmonary gas exchange and maintain adequate cerebral oxygen delivery. Goal cerebral NIRS > 60%.\n\n1. Post-ductal saturations as low as 60% are acceptable as long as pre-ductal saturations remain ≥85% and perfusion is satisfactory. Post-ductal PaO2 values as low as 30 mmHg are common and do not represent a need to escalate therapy. PaCO2 values in the mid-60s are tolerated if the patient is otherwise stable. NaHCO3 can be given to keep pH >7.2 even in the presence of hypercarbia. A 1:2 I: E ratio is used if the IMV rate is >30 with a inspiratory time of 0.6 sec for rates <30. An IMV rate of 100 is not uncommon. PIP is kept ≤25 or Paw ≤15 except for rare increases to 28 and 17, respectively, for decreased chest movement/lung expansion or to bridge to ECMO.\n\n<a id='54900116-996c-4b71-89fc-8df6164b3d21'></a>\n\nB. Use of inhaled Nitric Oxide (iNO) and ECMO\n\n1. Consider iNO in patients who cannot maintain pre-ductal saturations >85% or post-ductal PaO2 >30, have a pre/post-ductal saturation differential > 10%, or who show evidence of inadequate oxygen delivery based on rising lactate levels. iNO is initiated at a dose of 20 ppm. Obtain ECHO before initiating iNO if possible. iNO is most helpful in the setting of elevated PVR with right to left shunting at the ductal and atrial level and preductal desaturation. In the setting of left to right shunting at the atrial level and poor LV function, pulmonary vasodilation may worsen left atrial and pulmonary venous hypertension and increase the risk of pulmonary hemorrhage. An RCT did not demonstrate a reduced need for ECMO or death, however iNO use remains common in this patient population and may be used as a bridge to ECMO. Monitor for response to treatment. If there is no response after 1 hour of treatment, iNO may be discontinued. Response to iNO is defined as: a decrease of 10-20% in the pre/post-ductal saturation differential, or an increase of 10-20% in PaO2, or an improvement in hemodynamic parameters (10% increase in blood pressure, or a decrease in lactate levels). If there is no improvement in oxygenation despite maximal ventilator support and iNO then proceed to ECMO.\n2. Small studies and meta-analyses have concluded that ECMO use improves survival in this patient population. Often the usual OI criteria are modified due to the desire to limit barotrauma and pre-ductal saturations are used in conjunction with other clinical data.\n\n<a id='6cc34e7a-aa18-4cfc-9da3-4ca03ffe8e72'></a>\n\nThe following are indications for ECMO:\n\na. Inability to maintain pre-ductal saturations despite initiation of HFOV and iNO\nb. PIP >24 or Paw > 15 cm H2O to achieve pre-ductal saturation > 85%\nc. OI \\u2265 40 for at least 3 hours\nd. Inadequate oxygen delivery with resultant metabolic acidosis: lactate \\u2265 5mmol/L and pH < 7.15\ne. pCO2 > 70 resulting in a respiratory acidosis with pH < 7.15, despite optimization of ventilator management\nf. Hypotension resistant to fluid resuscitation and adequate inotropic support resulting in a urine output of < 0.5ml/kg/hr for 12-24 hours\n\n<a id='8f7d9e84-b2ef-44b0-8917-6a558e942fb7'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Either VV or VA ECMO can be used and there is no evidence of superiority for one modality over the other. ECMO runs in CDH patients are often long. Pulmonary outcomes can still be excellent and arbitrary limitation of ECMO duration to <4 weeks should be avoided.\n\n<a id='1a6e2764-91e1-4f9a-b94c-8af74e98d835'></a>\n\n3. Second ECMO runs have been used in this patient population with success rates varying from 36% to 44%. This survival compares favorably with the overall ECMO survival of 51% reported in the International ELSO Registry.\n\n<a id='0c5fc3cd-02f1-40c9-9eeb-1bbff52e3f29'></a>\n\n### C. Pulmonary Hypertension Management and Use of Other Vasoactive Medications\n\nPulmonary hypertension in CDH is related to a decreased cross-sectional area of the pulmonary vascular bed with pulmonary hypoplasia and adventitial and medial wall thickening due to increased smooth muscle cells in pulmonary arteries. Increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) can lead to right to left shunting with hypoxemia and pre/post-ductal saturation differential. Shunting may also occur at the level of the foramen ovale, in which case there may not be a significant pre/post-ductal saturation differential. An ECHO should be performed in the first 24 hours after birth to assess for the degree of pulmonary hypertension as well as to evaluate both right and left heart function. If pre-ductal saturations are < 85%, despite changes to ventilator parameters, and there are signs of poor organ perfusion, pulmonary hypertension should be treated. Initial steps include optimizing intravascular volume, transfusion to maintain Hct > 40%, and use of inotropes to maintain blood pressure at normal levels for the gestational age. Following these measures, iNO should be initiated at 20ppm.\n\n<a id='64611a49-f59e-4822-a31d-8543cefc6d0c'></a>\n\nWhen there is abnormal left ventricular function and signs of RV dependent systemic circulation demonstrated by ECHO, both Milrinone and PGE can be used.\n\n1. Milrinone, a Phosphodiesterase-3 inhibitor, has been used in CDH associated with elevated PVR and RV dependent systemic circulation due to abnormal LV function. The rationale for its use is three-fold: direct pulmonary vasodilation, improved systolic function; and as a lusitropic agent it improves diastolic function. It has been shown to improve RV systolic and diastolic function by ECHO and improve oxygenation. Doses used range from 0.50-0.75 mcg/kg/min. (0.025-0.75 mg/kg/min).\n\n2. Prostaglandin E1: PGE, has been used in several small studies to maintain ductal patency and stabilize LV and RV function. When there is systemic to supra-systemic pulmonary pressures, the RV becomes overloaded and enlarged. Enlargement of the RV with bowing of the intraventricular septum can impair LV filling and result in poor systemic perfusion. Severe LV dysfunction leads to dependence on the RV for systemic perfusion and thus there may be benefit from strategies to main ductal patency. Doses used are generally 5-10 ng/kg/min (0.005-0.01mcg/kg/min).\n\n3. Sildenafil: Sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor, has primarily been used in the management of chronic pulmonary hypertension in the post-operative period in neonates with CDH. Intravenous sildenafil is available but not FDA approved. There are limited data on efficacy of IV sildenafil for treatment in the acute phase, but in small retrospective cohort studies, sildenafil was associated with ECHO evidence of reduced PVR.\n\n<a id='42d3e99c-b593-41ad-9a2a-2baab5b6a683'></a>\n\n## VI. Timing of Surgical Repair\n\nTiming of CDH repair has varied over the last 3 decades. Initially patients were operated on soon after birth, but in the 1990s there was a change in practice to delay repair until physiologic stability was achieved. The definition of 'physiologic stability and delayed repair' is center dependent and timing of repair ranges from days to weeks. There is no evidence that delayed repair results in improved survival. New evidence suggests that timing of repair should be dependent on the severity of the defect and degree of lung hypoplasia. Severity can be defined by multiple factors such as side of defect (right vs. left), size of defect, degree of abdominal content herniation, liver- up vs. liver-down, defect size as determined at the time of repair, and prenatal measurements of lung size or volume\n\n<a id='18cff307-c677-4377-aac7-7fe1baa5fb8f'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Physiologic parameters after birth may also predict survival and need for ECMO. The relationship between timing of surgical repair and survival appears to vary by severity of the defect and degree of lung hypoplasia. Those with left liver-down CDH have been shown to benefit from a delay in surgical repair of > 48 hours after birth. Repair prior to 48 hours resulted in an increased need for ECMO without improvement in survival. For those with liver-up CDH, a significant delay in repair may result in increased mortality. A recent study found that neonates with left liver-up CDH had reduced mortality if they were repaired prior to going on ECMO. In a cohort of 87 ECMO eligible left liver-up patients, 60 required ECMO (69%). 20 of 21 (95%) repaired in the first 60 hours after birth and before ECMO survived; whereas only 13 of 20 (65%) who had repair delayed and arrived to ECMO unrepaired survived (p=0.02). Timing of repair should be discussed on a daily basis with the Pediatric Surgeons.\n\n<a id='34dd8668-90bf-4d58-b7ac-4dd02c2043d5'></a>\n\nVII. **Guidelines for Weaning Respiratory Support**\n\nA. FiO2 Weaning\n\n1. Goal is to maintain a pre-ductal saturation 85-95% or PaO2 60-90 mmHg. Start weaning when pre-ductal saturations have stabilized. Wean for pre-ductal saturations > 95%. Goal is to wean to FiO2 < 45%.\n\nB. Conventional Ventilator\n\n1. Wean PIP/PC before rate depending on tidal volume to keep goal PaCO2 as described above.\n2. Adjust FiO2 as needed to maintain pre-ductal SaO2 as described above.\n\nC. High Frequency Ventilation\n\n1. Wean FiO2 to achieve goal pre-ductal saturations.\n2. Wean Paw only if the infant is on less than 60% oxygen and lung expansion is greater than 8 ribs.\n3. Adjust amplitude or frequency to maintain target PaCO2. Increase frequency before amplitude if frequency is <10.\n\nD. Weaning Inhaled Nitric Oxide\n\n<a id='2500883c-1aa7-4a57-aba3-06f773d38f23'></a>\n\n1. iNO should be weaned only after the infant is stable on < 60% oxygen and is on reasonable Paw if on HFOV or PIP if on SIMV. Discuss the timing of surgery before weaning pulmonary vasodilators because of a possible increase in pulmonary vascular resistance after surgery.\n2. iNO should be weaned slowly over 24 hours.\n\n<a id='efe87e8f-e9db-4751-98dd-0bb254226b1c'></a>\n\n## VIII. Considerations Prior to Discharge\n\nA. Brain MRI should be obtained prior to discharge in any patient with a severe neonatal course (prolonged mechanical ventilation or ECMO). MRI findings of delayed maturation, white matter injury (PVL) and white matter volume loss have been reported in this population. Evidence of brain injury on MRI may facilitate obtaining interventional therapies at an earlier age after discharge.\n\nB. Due to the risk of neurocognitive delay, all patients should be referred for follow-up in the High-Risk Infant Follow-Up clinic.\n\nC. Late-onset hearing loss occurs in up to 30% of CDH patients. Newborn hearing screen results are not predictive of which patient will develop sensorineural hearing loss. Predictors include prolonged mechanical ventilation, ECMO, large defect size, and duration of treatment with loop diuretics and exposure to aminoglycosides. All patients should be referred for outpatient audiology exams at the time of discharge with\n\n<a id='f31b2d68-688a-4fc2-a0de-73c724b56837'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

OT follow-up after discharge is important, as many neonates with CDH will develop feeding difficulties and oral aversion.\nE. RSV prophylaxis should be given to all patients with CDH prior to discharge during the RSV season.\n\n<a id='91f4280f-80e5-4e1c-80d7-624520e40856'></a>\n\nIX. LPCH CDH Survival Results\n\nWe have submitted data to the CDH Study Group since 1995. The most recent report includes babies born after January 1, 2007 and compares survival by defect type. Type A is most mild and type D is complete agenesis of the diaphragm. Overall LPCH survival is 78% compared to mean international survival of 71%, isolated CDH survival at LPCH is 86% compared to international survival of 75%. Most notable is our success with most severe group D where we have survival 73% compared to international survival of 58%. Similarly, our CDH ECMO survival is 67% compared with international results 52%\n\n<a id='2fdb3ed9-faf3-4f2b-8e1e-4c4600dcf96b'></a>\n\nReferences\n1.

General\n\nA. ECMO is the use of prolonged extracorporeal circulation and gas exchange via a modified heart-lung machine to provide temporary life support in patients with cardiac and/or respiratory failure who are refractory to maximum ventilatory and medical management. 1 ECMO patients are cared for by a separate service staffed by Drs. Krisa Van Meurs, Bill Rhine, Lou Halamek, Sonia Bonifacio, Valerie Chock, Alexis Davis, Jon Palma, Nicole Yamada, and Shazia Bhombal. You will need to know how to identify potential ECMO candidates, how to ready your patient for ECMO, and how to care for the infant following ECMO.\n\n<a id='30ec00a5-9416-4440-9136-e6e4b0510b4f'></a>\n\nII. **ECMO Criteria**\n\n1. The neonatal ECMO criteria at LPCH are the following:\n\n   1. Gestational age ≥34 wks and weight ≥2.0 kg.\n   2. No intracranial hemorrhage >grade II.\n   3. No lethal congenital anomalies.\n   4. Infant has not required mechanical ventilation for a prolonged period of time.\n   5. Cardiac or respiratory failure despite maximal medical therapy with a mortality estimated to be approximately 80%. The most commonly used quantitative measurement is an Oxygenation Index (OI) >40 on 2 ABGs 30 min apart or OI > 20 for 24 hours without improvement despite prolonged maximal medical therapy or persistent episodes of decompensation.\n\nOI = (Mean Airway Pressure) (FiO2)(100) / PaO2\n\n<a id='f82e5b59-cf56-4f69-8318-a408db025281'></a>\n\n### III. Pre-ECMO Procedures\n\nInfants who are being considered for ECMO should receive:\n\nA. **Echocardiogram**: The echocardiogram is to exclude congenital heart disease, look for pulmonary hypertension, and also to check the fractional shortening, which will help decide whether the infant will receive venovenous (VV) or venoarterial (VA) ECMO. VA ECMO provides complete cardio-respiratory support via 2 catheters in the internal jugular vein and carotid artery, while VV ECMO provides respiratory support alone via a single dual lumen catheter in the internal jugular vein.2\n\nB. **Head Ultrasound**: This is done to check for significant intracranial hemorrhage, which could extend with the systemic heparinization. Intracranial hemorrhage is one of the risks associated with ECMO and occurs in 5-10% of ECMO patients.3 It occurs at higher rates in those of lower gestational age and with other risk factors such as asphyxia, acidosis, and coagulation abnormalities. If there is a Grade I or II bleed, ECMO is still feasible, however the ECMO doctors may choose to use less heparin and an antifibrinolytic agent, Amicar®.4\n\nC. **Coagulation Studies**: A PT, PTT, fibrinogen, and platelet count should be sent on patients being considered for ECMO. Any coagulation abnormalities should be corrected prior to ECMO cannulation\n\nD. **ECMO Consent**: The ECMO attending and NICU fellow will take obtain the consent and notify the ECMO team, which includes the Perfusionist, OR Charge Nurse, and Pediatric Surgeon.\n\nE. **Blood Product Ordering**:\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

For emergency ECMO when there is no ABO/Rh type, use order set in EPIC \"ECMO Emergency Priming – with Uncrossmatched Blood Products\" which includes: 2 units of type O, Rh negative packed RBCs and 50 ml FFP type AB to be used for circuit priming.\n2. For non-emergency ECMO 2 units dry packed RBCs and 50 ml FFP for priming are ordered. This order is part of the ECMO (NICU) order set in EPIC.\n3. Give 10 mL/kg unpacked platelets ASAP once on bypass.\n4. Whenever ECMO is being performed in the NICU, an emergency RBC unit will be kept in the NICU.\n\n<a id='c5a42404-11d7-4a4c-8391-08fbd0a33806'></a>\n\n**F. ECMO Orders:**\n1. There are specific order sets which should be completed for any patient to be placed on ECMO, these are completed by the neonatal fellow or ECMO attending.\n\n<a id='0c835918-3d62-4ed5-ade6-5f2fcf8a0ebb'></a>\n\n## IV. Post-ECMO Procedures\n\nAfter the patient is decannulated, you will again assume responsibility for their care. You will receive a signout from the ECMO doctors. In general, some of the post-ECMO concerns will be:\n\nA. **Respiratory**: In general, patients weaned off ECMO no longer have PPHN physiology. The respiratory care goals will be normal gases with pH 7.35-7.45, PaCO2 40-50, and PaO2 60-80. After the infant has awakened from the vecuronium and fentanyl given for the decannulation procedure, the ventilator can be weaned. Most ECMO patients are extubated within 48-72 hrs after ECMO with the exception of infants with CDH, who may still have PPHN, require longer periods of ventilation post-ECMO, and require more gradual weaning of mechanical ventilation.\n\nB. **Fluids, Electrolytes, and Nutrition**: The fluid and electrolyte requirements on ECMO are different and generally patients require more KCI (4 mEq/kg) and less NaCl (2 mEq/kg). Patients are generally fluid restricted on ECMO and develop some edema while on bypass. The TPN on ECMO has a high dextrose concentration and the patient receives limited lipids. The post-ECMO TPN orders will need to be changed. The total IV fluid rate will depend on the fluid status, but the NaCl should be increased to 3 mEq/kg and the KCL decreased to 2mEq/kg. Electrolytes will need to be checked 2 times daily for 48 hrs. The total glucose given (mg/kg/min) may be kept the same, but the dextrose concentration will decrease as several drips will be discontinued (heparin drip, sedation, and possibly Amicar®). The intralipids can also be advanced once off ECMO.\n\nC. **Hematologic**: ECMO patients receive frequent platelet transfusions while on ECMO to keep their platelet count >80-100K and decrease the risk of bleeding complications. The platelet count and hematocrit should be checked twice daily for 48 hrs. Post ECMO patients should receive a platelet transfusion for platelet count<75,000 in the first 24-48 hours following decannulation\n\nD. **Neurologic**: ECMO patients receive a daily HUS during the first week on bypass; less frequent exams may be done thereafter depending on the individual patient, and are monitored with NIRS and aEEG. No further HUS will be needed after ECMO, but an MRI is ordered when the infant is extubated or prior to return transport. This is done to check for intracranial hemorrhage, cerebral infarct or extra-axial fluid collections.\n\nE. **Follow-up**: ECMO patients are seen in the Developmental and Behavioral Clinic at 4 mos, 12 mos, and 2 yrs to assess neurodevelopmental outcome, respiratory outcomes, and hearing. All infants placed on ECMO should be referred for outpatient audiology evaluation. As a group, ECMO survivors are at increased risk of behavioral and school difficulties, although mean IQ is within the normal range. The rate of major disabilityand mental retardation is comparable to other high-risk populations.5 Please have an appointment scheduled prior\n\n<a id='b8bdd944-497f-4425-bb09-3c878be40e1a'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

This pattern is common in preterm infants, maybe due to instability of respiratory\ncontrol center. This is a typical breathing pattern in full-term and pre-term infants during active (rapid eye\nmovement, REM) sleep.\n\nE. **Apnea types**:\n\n1. **Central**: breathing pause without respiratory effort.\n\n2. **Obstructive**: e.g., respiratory effort without effective ventilation and airflow; may be associated with\nmechanical/anatomic abnormality or failure to maintain upper airway muscle tone during inspiration.\n\n3. **Mixed**: Usually a central respiratory pause preceded or followed by airway obstruction.\n\nII. **Differential Diagnosis of Apnea**\n\nA. **Infection**: especially with history of prolonged rupture of membranes, maternal fever, central lines, RSV in the\nolder infant.\n\nB. **Impaired oxygenation**: pallor, shock, L-to-R shunt through PDA, anemia, pulmonary edema, and heart\nfailure.\n\nC. **Metabolic disorders**: hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalance, lactic acidosis.\n\nD. **Drugs**: maternal opiates, anti-convulsants, prostaglandin, magnesium.\n\nE. **Neurologic**: seizures, asphyxia, intracranial hemorrhage, brain malformation, increased intracranial pressure\ndue to hydrocephalus.\n\nF. **Feeding-related**: Association with gastroesophageal reflux \"GER\" in the full-term infant and pre-term infant is\ntenuous and should not be assumed without good supporting evidence such as a pH Probe Study. (See NICU\nGuide Section II.F. \"Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease\".) Dysphagia and aspiration can also cause apnea,\nparticularly in patients with a history of tracheo-esophageal fistula, laryngomalacia, or neurologic dysfunction\n\nG. **Thermal instability**: Both hyper- and hypothermia can cause apnea.\n\nH. **Idiopathic**: apnea of prematurity, respiratory drive instability.\n\nI. **Pulmonary disease**: decreased lung compliance (e.g., RDS, pneumonia), increased work-of-breathing.\n\nJ. **Airway obstruction**: anatomic, malposition of trachea associated with neck flexion, excessive oral secretions.\n\n<a id='ea6860ba-3442-4fbb-8f5d-8a7c05783576'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Pathogenesis\n\nA. **Chemoreceptor function:** Preterm infants have a biphasic response to hypoxemia, with a transient increase in ventilation followed by a sustained depression of ventilation. Carbon dioxide responsiveness is a predominantly central chemoreceptor activity and is less well-developed the more immature the infant. Hypoxemia and hyperoxia also make the preterm infant less responsive to carbon dioxide.\n\nB. **Respiratory center depression:** The frequency of apnea decreases as the brainstem function improves with increasing post-menstrual age (PMA). Respiratory center activity may be impaired by general CNS depressants and changes in ambient temperature.\n\nC. **Sleep state:** Apnea occurs predominantly during active (REM) sleep and indeterminate (transitional) sleep in both preterm and term infants. This may be due to paradoxical chest wall movements (vagal inhibition of intercostal muscles) and decreased FRC during active sleep.\n\nD. **Obstruction:** Airway obstruction may occur spontaneously with infant-initiated neck flexion or passively (e.g., inappropriately placed face mask).\n\nE. **Reflexes:** Active reflexes caused by stimulation of the posterior pharynx (with a suction catheter) of the eyes (e.g. during bag mask ventilation area oculovagal reflex) can incite apnea.\n\nF. **Pulmonary insufficiency of prematurity:** when pulmonary function is insufficient for metabolic needs of the infant.\n\n### IV. Incidence of Apnea of Prematurity\n\nA. Incidence is inversely related to PMA.\n\nB. Generally begins at 1-2 days of age but can start any time during the hospitalization.\n\nC. Persists for variable length of time. Usually decreases by 37 wks PMA;\n   1. May last longer for infants <28 wks gestation at birth.\n   2. May persist beyond 40 wks PMA, either as mild events during sleep, or with feeds.\n\nD. Abnormal for term or near-term infants, look for identifiable cause.\n\nE. No relationship between apnea of prematurity and later SIDS.\n\n### V. Evaluation of the Apneic Infant\n\nA. **Complete history and physical examination:** assess frequency, duration, and temporal association of apneic events.\n\nB. **Respiratory evaluation:**\n   1. ABG (look for hypoxia, acidosis, hypercarbia)\n   2. CXR (look for pulmonary problem e.g., atelectasis, pulmonary edema or infiltrates)\n\nC. **Infectious disease:**\n   1. CBC with manual differential.\n\n<a id='ad4b5db7-6af4-4568-ba90-9d4a7f00b8e8'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

NP swab for viral pathogens if indicated by symptoms.\n4. If sepsis is suspected, obtain appropriate cultures (blood, urine, CSF) and begin empiric antibiotics.\n\nD. Metabolic:\n\n1. Electrolytes, calcium, magnesium, glucose.\n2. Drug levels (if on methylxanthine or CNS depressant).\n3. Consider inborn error of metabolism.\n\nE. Neurologic:\n\n1. Head ultrasound (if intracranial hemorrhage or post-hemmorhagic hydocephalus suspected).\n2. MRI (if brain abnormality suspected).\n3. If seizures suspected, obtain an aEEG; consider anticonvulsants, request neurology consult.\n4. Sleep/apnea study (to clarify type of apnea, frequency, duration, and associated events).\n\nF. Cardiac: Consider PDA in preterms.\n\nG. Gastrointestinal: Gastroesophageal Reflux (GER) on a pH probe study is found commonly and may be physiologic in preterm and term infants, but it is usually not the cause for apnea in the preterm infant. An apnea pH study may be helpful to clarify this issue but again this association rarely is found to be the cause for apnea in the preterm infant. The use of histamine blockers does not stop GER, and does have associate risk (e.g., NEC). A Modified Barium Swallow can diagnose dysphagia and aspiration from above. The OT sta will usually assess the patient clinically first, and will participate in the Modified Barium Swallow if deemed indicated. Since both are common in premature infants, and may resolve with maturation, work-up for either GERD or swallow dysfunction should be delayed until the patient is close to maturity (> 37 wk PMA) unless there is a strong indication (e.g., tracheo-esophageal fistula).\n\nH. Hematologic: The association between anemia and apnea is weak and our ability to predict which patient's symptoms will respond to transfusion is poor. Avoid transfusion unless there are other symptoms suggestive of anemia (e.g., tachycardia, poor weight gain).\n\n<a id='575ca627-8999-4f67-b91e-76ce2eee426e'></a>\n\n## VI. Treatment\n\nA. Treat any underlying causes, if identified.\n\n1. Treat hypoxemia/hypercarbia with supplemental oxygen to keep pO2 60-80; avoid reflexes that may trigger apnea; consider drug therapy.\n2. Nasal Cannula O2, or CPAP may help if obstructive process or pulmonary insufficiency of prematurity is cause.\n3. Consider blood transfusion depending on level of anemia and hypoxemia.\n4. Mechanical ventilation, if above interventions fail.\n\n<a id='aef7f57a-c501-4e51-8ac3-ac4da5f86665'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Caffeine citrate: Methylxanthines act mainly on brainstem respiratory neurons, producing a central stimulatory effect, but may also improve diaphragmatic contractility (non-specific inhibitors of adenosine receptors). Caffeine is preferred over theophylline because it has a longer half-life and allows more stable blood levels, and its broader therapeutic range allowing us to forego monitoring blood levels. At LPCH, caffeine is ordered as caffeine citrate.\n\n<a id='b142d11b-585c-4b30-b387-ea159d3fec8d'></a>\n\n1. Loading dose: 20 mg/kg IV or PO.\n2. Maintenance: 5 mg/kg daily IV or PO.\n3. Caffeine for prophylaxis of apnea of prematurity may be effective for ELBW infants.\n4. Caffeine has been associated with a decreased incidence of both BPD and Cerebral Palsy in infants with a birth weight <1250 g.\n5. Caffeine has been used to prevent post-operative apnea/brady/desats in growing preterm infants.\n6. Caffeine should be stopped at 34-35 wks PMA or 5-days without significant apnea, whichever comes first:\n   a. Monitor for ≥ 5 days off caffeine while serum levels drop below therapeutic.\n   b. Apnea beyond 38 wks PMA suggests an etiology other than prematurity.\n   c. Recent literature suggests that longer treatment with Caffeine might be helpful for preterm infants with persistent Apnea without any other pathogenesis.\n7. Insignificant events, not requiring intervention, home monitoring, resumption of caffeine, or delay of discharge include (in appropriate babies):\n   a. Isolated bradycardia with pulse > 60 and no desaturation, that resolve in 20 sec.\n   b. Self-limited desaturation not below SpO2 of 80%\n\n<a id='2e909619-4065-4de0-a7ac-efaca6c620d2'></a>\n\n## VII. Home Apnea Monitoring\n\n### A. Indications:\n1.

Oxygen is a drug; it is probably the most widely used drug in the intensive care setting. Although oxygen can be life-saving, it can also be toxic.\n\n1. Use of 100% oxygen in incubators during the 1940s and 1950s was linked to a very high incidence of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) - as the oxygen concentration was decreased over the 1950's and 1960's, the ROP rate dropped.\n2. Evidence shows that reactive oxygen species, like superoxide, in combination with other factors, can lead to inflammation and damage of tissues and organs including the lung. This may play an important role in the development of chronic lung disease.\n3. Antioxidant defense systems are likely to be decreased and impaired in premature infants, so our patients are at even higher risk for damage due to oxygen toxicity.\n4. A number of studies led to the recognition that an optimal range for oxygen saturation and PaO2 had not been elucidated fully for preterm infants receiving supplemental oxygen. Subsequently, several recent randomized controlled trials have investigated oxygen saturation targets within the AAP recommended ranges.\n\na. Several trials from 1950s to 1970s compared unrestricted oxygen supplementation (FiO2>50%) for 2-7 weeks with more \"restricted\" oxygen supplementation to ≤50% inspired oxygen concentration regardless of the condition of the preterm infants.\n\ni. The practice of \"restricted\" oxygen was NOT associated with an increase in mortality.\nii. A meta-analysis of 5 trials showed that oxygen restriction decreased the incidence and severity of retinopathy without an effect on mortality.\n\nb. A retrospective study reviewing different oxygenation policies in England for infants born less than 28 weeks suggested that keeping target oxygen saturations in the range 70-90% was associated with a lower rate of threshold ROP and shorter duration of time on oxygen and on the ventilator compared with a higher target range. No improvement in survival or rate of cerebral palsy was seen in the higher saturation group.\n\nc. Another retrospective study of 7 United States NICUs reported that in infants 500-1000 g, a policy of accepting lower O2 saturations was associated with LOWER rates of CLD, severe ROP, and ROP requiring surgery. There was no difference in survival rates between groups.\n\nd. A study comparing resuscitation at birth with room air vs. 100% oxygen in term infants followed markers for oxidant stress and antioxidant enzymes at birth, 72 hrs after birth, and 28 days after birth. The infants resuscitated with room air had increased markers for oxidant stress and antioxidant enzymes compared to non-asphyxiated infants at 72 hrs of age. The infants resuscitated with 100% oxygen had significantly higher levels than infants resuscitated with room air. At 28 days of life the markers for the infant resuscitated with room air were the same as for the non-asphyxiated infants, but the infants resuscitated with 100% oxygen still had significantly higher markers for oxidant stress and antioxidant enzymes at 28 days of life.\n\ne. The AAP and ACOG Guidelines for Perinatal Care is the official publication that sets standards of perinatal care in the US.

Therefore, randomized controlled trails were undertaken to attempt to determine the best target range _within the recommended guidelines_ for extremely preterm infants.\n\n<a id='e9b99031-6357-4eb3-a68f-4f01c2302aa8'></a>\n\n5. Recent Randomized Controlled Trials\n\na. The SUPPORT trial of the NICHD Neonatal Research Network was a 2x2 factorial, multi-center study designed to compare 2 approaches to early respiratory management (Finer N, NEJM 2010) and 2 ranges of oxygen saturation (85-89% vs. 91-95%) among infants born at 24 to <28 weeks of gestation. The lower oxygenation arm did not significantly decrease the composite outcome of severe ROP or death, but did result in an increase in mortality and a substantial decrease in severe ROP among survivors.\n\nb. The BOOST II trial (UK, Australia, New Zealand) also compared the same 2 oxygen saturation ranges (85-89% vs. 91-95%) among <28 week EGA infants. The lower oxygenation arm was associated with a significantly increased risk for death, and a significantly decreased risk for ROP.\n\nc. The COT trial (Canada, US, Argentina, Finland, Germany, Israel) showed differing results. In extremely preterm infants, targeting oxygen saturations of 85% to 89% compared with 91% to 95% had no significant effect on the rate of death or disability at 18 months.\n\nd. A recent meta-analysis of these major international studies6 reported \"no significant differences in death or disability at 24 months, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy of prematurity, neurodevelopmental outcomes, or hearing loss at 24 months.\"\n\ne. However, one recent paper did seem to show a decrease in severe ROP & laser treatment with increased O2 saturations at PMA ≥ 36 wk.\n\n<a id='5174f59c-dc30-40f2-9dfc-e725f27f3afd'></a>\n\n## II. Oxygen Therapy for Pre-threshold ROP\n\nA. The STOP-ROP study investigated the possibility that supplemental oxygen might reduce the progression of prethreshold ROP to threshold ROP. The findings indicated that use of supplemental oxygen did not cause any further progression, but also didn't reduce the need for eye surgery in most patients. One subgroup of patients, those without plus disease treated with supplemental oxygen, had a lower rate of progression to threshold.\n\nB. There is ongoing debate about the best way to treat prethreshold ROP, but supplemental oxygen may be beneficial in a particular subgroup of patients. At Stanford, we currently use supplemental oxygen for some patients with prethreshold disease\n\n<a id='b68bfd4b-4673-472d-b216-eed672d9ede6'></a>\n\n### III.

It occurs mainly in infants who are born very prematurely and who require prolonged assisted ventilation to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome (hyaline membrane disease), sustained or recurrent apnea or respiratory failure from sepsis or pneumonia. The condition also develops in some mature infants who are treated with long-term mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure from meconium aspiration, bacterial or viral pneumonia, lung hypoplasia or cardiopulmonary malformations.\n\nB. In 1989, the Bureau of Maternal and Child Health and Resources Development proposed the following diagnostic criteria for BPD:\n\n   1. Requirement for positive pressure ventilation during the first 2 weeks of life. Minimum requirement of ventilation for 3 days.\n   2. Clinical signs of respiratory compromise persisting beyond 28 days of age.\n   3. Requirement for supplemental oxygen beyond 28 days of age in order to maintain a PaO2 of greater than 50 Torr.\n   4. Chest radiographs showing characteristic lung abnormalities (diffuse bilateral densities, often associated with areas of hyperinflation).\n\nC. The definition has been modified to specify a need for supplemental oxygen for greater than 28 days, or extending beyond 36 weeks post-menstrual age [PMA], accompanied by characteristic radiographic abnormalities.\n\nD. An NIH-sponsored workshop on BPD reached a consensus to refer to this disease as BPD instead of CLD to distinguish it from chronic lung diseases seen in later life. A more extensive definition was proposed which uses oxygen dependency at 36 PMA (failure to maintain normal oxygen saturation when breathing room air), and defines mild, moderate, and severe disease. A recent report supported the validity of the more refined definitions of BPD severity according to need for supplemental oxygen and/or positive-pressure breathing at 36 wks PMA. This \"physiologic\" definition of BPD is preferred at LPCH.\n\nE. Most recently, it has been reported that surviving very low gestational age infants may be at risk of impaired lung function in childhood even if they pass the proposed physiologic testing.\n\n<a id='13018846-16a8-47f2-b597-c4058345201b'></a>\n\n## II. Incidence\n\nA. The incidence of BPD is variable between newborn care centers, reflecting not only differences in patient population and infant management practices, but also the different criteria used to define BPD.\n\nB. Recent reports indicate that the incidence of BPD varies from 15-50% in infants whose birth weight is 1500 gm or less and who require assisted ventilation for initial respiratory distress, with most reports showing about a 20-25% incidence of BPD among infants with a birth weight between 500-1500 gm who have received mechanical ventilation.\n\nC. The incidence of BPD is inversely related to gestational age, varying from 80% or more among the most immature infants (less than 24 weeks gestation) to under 5% among infants beyond 32 weeks gestation.\n\n<a id='0874c60c-9b6a-4e30-b0ad-6e41ef643b54'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

The initiating event in BPD is considered to be inflammation of the incompletely developed newborn lung. The condition may be associated with chorioamnionitis before birth, systemic infection after birth, or pulmonary accumulation of activated neutrophils, which has been described in hyaline membrane disease, aspiration syndromes, pneumonia, and prolonged application of positive-pressure mechanical ventilation.\n\nB. Deficiency of anti-oxidant enzymes and inhibitors of proteolytic enzymes renders the very immature infant's lungs especially vulnerable to the effects of toxic oxygen metabolites and proteases that are released during inflammation by activated neutrophils and macrophages.\n\nC. **Conditions that are associated with BPD:**\n\n1. Prematurity (especially extreme lung immaturity).\n2. Repetitive stretch and overinflation of the lungs (\"volutrauma\") associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation using large tidal volumes and high inflation pressures.\n3. Oxygen toxicity (related to the magnitude and duration of exposure to supplemental oxygen, and owing to the relative deficiency of antioxidant enzymes in the immature lung).\n4. Development of pulmonary air leaks, notably interstitial emphysema, and pneumothoraces.\n5. Lung edema: excessive fluid and salt intake, persistence of a patent ductus arteriosus, myocardial dysfunction.\n6. Infection and associated inflammation, sometimes with chorioamnionitis before birth, sepsis or pneumonia after birth or acquisition of nosocomial infections.\n7. Conditions that may contribute to acute lung injury and non-uniform lung expansion: aspiration of gastric contents, incorrect placement of the endotracheal tube, improper delivery of surfactant, airway obstruction from mucous plugs.\n8. Other factors: poor nutritional support, genetic predisposition to reactive airways disease, vitamin A deficiency, insufficient adrenal and thyroid hormone release in the very premature infant, gastro-esophageal reflux, and associated aspiration pneumonitis.\n\n<a id='b7cdc882-7ba7-4c07-9957-4b4d3796a423'></a>\n\nD. Pulmonary Dysfunction in BPD:\n\n1. Increased lung vascular resistance, typically associated with impaired responsiveness to inhaled nitric oxide and other vasodilators, sometimes progressing to right heart failure which, in turn, may impair lung lymphatic drainage.\n2. Increased respiratory tract resistance and hyper-reactive airways leading to episodic bronchoconstriction and cyanosis.\n3. Impaired respiratory gas exchange (hypoxemia with need for supplemental oxygen, alveolar hypoventilation with resultant hypercapnia), mismatch of ventilation and perfusion.\n4. Diminished lung compliance, tachypnea, and increased minute ventilation and work of breathing.\n5. Increased lung microvascular filtration pressure that leads to interstitial pulmonary edema.\n\n<a id='c22de359-7d3c-4965-9238-c836f1eea2e7'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Structural and molecular abnormalities of the lung in BPD:\n\n1. Increased smooth muscle in small pulmonary arteries and airways.\n2. Decreased numbers of terminal respiratory units (alveoli and secondary crests); increased alveolar size.\n3. Decreased numbers of microvessels, with reduced pulmonary expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and VEGF receptors.\n4. Increased abundance and abnormal distribution of elastin in the lung parenchyma and circulation with increased pulmonary expression of tropoelastin mRNA.\n5. Interstitial pulmonary edema.\n6. Diminished endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) in lung blood vessels and airways.\n7. Increased numbers of neutrophils early in course with increased numbers of macrophages later in the course.\n\n<a id='d4de4a36-cb15-4565-8dc1-cba8d716b65a'></a>\n\nIV. **Treatment**\n\nA. The best approach for preventing or reducing the severity of BPD is to adopt strategies that minimize risk of lung injury and avoid conditions that likely contribute to lung injury.\n\n1.  Antenatal glucocorticoids and postnatal surfactant replacement may not prevent BPD, but they are likely to prevent or reduce the severity of acute lung disease after premature birth and thereby lessen the likelihood of severe chronic lung injury.\n\n2.  Early application of Nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (NCPAP) may help to maintain stability of the immature lung and reduce oxygen requirements, thereby lessening the need for mechanical ventilation and supplemental oxygen.\n\n3.  Treatment with a respiratory stimulant, specifically caffeine, reduces the risk of apnea, and has been shown to reduce the incidence of BPD.\n\n4.  Restricting fluid and salt intake in the first week, so that the infant does not exceed fluid and salt losses (actually allowing for diuresis and a progressive loss of ~15% body weight) has been shown to reduce the risk of BPD.\n\n5.  Assisted ventilation: \"Permissive hypercapnia,\" with use of low peak-inflation pressures (PIP), relatively short inspiratory times, and modest positive end-expiratory pressures (PEEP), allowing PaCO2 to be as high as 55 or 60 cm H2O as long as the pH is 7.25 or greater, appears to be a reasonable approach for managing mechanical ventilation of the premature infant with respiratory failure. As the lungs becomemore compliant, weaning from mechanical ventilation should focus on reducing PIP and tidal volume first to avoid lung over distention, waiting until the PIP is <20 cm H2O and the tidal volume is 4-6 mL/kg before reducing respirator rate. Proper heating and humidification of the inspired gas and caution with endotracheal tube suctioning are important considerations for preventing airway injury. It is noteworthy that despite good rationale for application of \"permissive hypercapnia\" to reduce lung injury in preterm infants (keeping PaCO2 55-65 mmHg during mechanical ventilation in the first wk of life), a randomized trial showed no apparent benefit of this approach for infants between 23-28 wks gestation. Nevertheless, it is still an accepted though debated treatment.\n\n<a id='82fb9a50-b3c9-4eab-b7c6-626ee7a006d9'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Early closure of the ductus arteriosus, either by pharmacologic intervention or surgical ligation, was believed to reduce the risk of pulmonary edema and of severe BPD; recent literature has questioned this.\n\n7. Careful and frequent evaluations to detect early signs of infection, meticulous monitoring of aseptic technique in infant handling and in the management of ventilator circuits and airway care, and early initiation of appropriate antimicrobial treatment for infection are critical issues in helping to reduce the incidence and severity of BPD.\n\n8. Although it is important to reduce the inspired oxygen concentration quickly if the oxygen saturation is >96% or PaO2 is >80 mm Hg, it is also important to avoid hypoxemia (O2 saturation <80% or PaO2 <50 mm Hg), which increases pulmonary vascular resistance, fluid filtration lung edema, and airways resistance. Recent studies indicate that either severe hypoxia or severe prolonged hyperoxia may inhibit lung epithelial Na transport and thereby contribute to pulmonary edema. The goal should be to keep the O2 saturation between 90-96% and PaO2 between 50-80 mm Hg. Recent studies have indicated an increased mortality in very low birth weight babies when O2 saturation maintained at < 90%, but a meta- analysis has questioned this. (See NICU Guide Section II.B.11. \"Oxygen Saturation Guidelines\").\n\n9. Other studies have shown that Dopamine, when delivered intravenously at low doses to support systemic blood pressure, can enhance lung epithelial Na transport and thereby facilitate clearance of liquid from the airspaces and resolution of pulmonary edema.\n\n<a id='5114f8c3-cfc0-4630-b84c-2ecc308fcd97'></a>\n\nB. Careful attention to fluid and salt balance is important to help reduce the risk of pulmonary edema.\n\n1. Fluid and heat losses in the very immature infant (<26 wks gestation) during the first few days after birth can be minimized by keeping the infant in a warm, humidified chamber beneath a radiant warmer.\n2. Fluid balance can be monitored effectively by keeping the infant on a bed scale and measuring body weight at frequent intervals, and by keeping accurate records of fluid intake and urine output.\n3. Frequent measurements of serum electrolytes (every 6 hrs for the very immature infant, every 12 hrs for the infant >26 wks gestation) are important in helping to guide fluid therapy. Sodium is withheld from IV fluids for at least the first 24 hrs and is not added until there is an appropriate diuresis (>2 mL/kg/h) and the weight is at least 5% below birthweight.\n4. In a suitably humidified environment, appropriate initial rates of IV fluid intake for the premature infant are:\n\n<a id='bb7739cc-dad7-4f56-a835-fa6e7da401c5'></a>\n\n>28 wks gestation: 60-80 mL/kg\n26-28 wks gestation: 80-100 mL/kg\n<26 wks gestation: 100-120 mL/kg\n\n5. These guidelines assume close monitoring of body weight, intake/output measurements, and serum sodium as noted above.\n\n6. After the brisk diuresis that usually occurs during the first 3-7 days, urine output generally decreases to about 2-4 mL/kg/h, and fluid intake can be adjusted to about 120-150 mL/kg/d.\n\n7. Once on full enteral nutrition, infants without evidence of CHF or renal dysfunction can almost always tolerated greater intake volumes, e.g., 160-180 mL/kg/d.\n\n<a id='59849b90-4e5e-412b-a4ee-84db1090b169'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Nutritional needs of the infant with BPD depend on environmental conditions (goal should be a neutral thermal environment), work of breathing, and general metabolism, which may be slightly greater than for infants without BPD.\n1. Early delivery of parenteral nutrition, including protein and lipid, through a peripherally placed central venous line is helpful in establishing early positive nitrogen balance and facilitating growth and lung repair.\n2. Caloric, protein, and mineral needs usually can be met with fortification of mother's breast milk or with premature infant formula with a caloric density of 24-30 kcal/oz.\n3. Premature infants with BPD require nutritional supplements of calcium and phosphorus, in addition to adequate vitamins, and if they are receiving diuretics they also may require additional potassium and chloride.\n\nD. Diuretics: Diuretics must be used with caution because of their potential complications, which include electrolyte deficiencies (notably of sodium, potassium, and chloride), bone demineralization from urinary calcium loss, nephrocalcinosis, and hearing impairment.\n1. Furosemide is a potent diuretic that reduces pulmonary blood flow and lung vascular filtration pressure and thereby decreases interstitial pulmonary edema. The usual dose is 1-2 mg/kg q12h, although every other day treatment also has been shown to improve BPD, perhaps with less likelihood of the aforementioned complications.\n2. Hydrochlorothiazide (1 mg/kg/dose q12h) and spironolactone (1-2 mg/kg/dose q12h) also may be useful, without adverse effects on urinary calcium or hearing loss. The combination (Aldactazide) has to be compounded by the pharmacy, and thus may not be available after discharge for patients who do not live near a Level III/IV NICU. These babies may need to be changed to PO Chlorothiazide 10 mg/kg/dose q12h, likely with PO Potassium Chloride supplements.\n3. Prolonged use of diuretics can cause contraction alkalosis with associated potassium and chloride depletion, usually heralded by a rising serum bicarbonate concentration and a low serum chloride concentration (sometimes in the presence of a low urine pH). Supplemental KCI (2-5 mEq/kg/d divided) or arginine HCI (if serum potassium is high) usually corrects this problem.\n\nE. Retinol (Vitamin A): Vitamin A has been found to decrease the incidence and severity of BPD in extremely premature infants that are deficient in vitamin A. For tiny infants on ventilator support, retinol is given intramuscularly at a dose of 5000 IU 3 times/wk for a total of 12 injections, which is the regimen that was used in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized control/treatment study. Vit A was unavailable due to manufacturing issues between 2010-2014, and the incidence of BPD did not increase, questioning the significance of this treatment, probably due to the marked decrease in Vitamin A deficiency.\n\nF. Glucocorticoids:\n1. Because immature infants often have very low plasma cortisol levels and do not always respond appropriately to corticotropin (ACTH), there is some evidence they may benefit from a short course (10-14 days) of hydrocortisone.\n2. Dexamethasone (Decadron) is not recommended because of its serious side effects: an increased incidence of cerebral palsy and poor neurologic outcome, perhaps related to the discovery of impaired brain growth and periventricular leukomalacia in infants who have received such therapy over a period of several days to weeks.\n3. Inhaled steroids have not been shown to be beneficial in reducing the incidence or severity of BPD.\n\n<a id='a17c3cdf-19de-4348-882d-7e4f290dc492'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

ẞ2-adrenergic agonists may be beneficial in BPD by relaxing smooth muscle constriction and also by inducing Na, K-ATPase activity in the lung epithelium, which may improve pulmonary edema.\n\n2. In unusual circumstances, aerosolized bronchodilators, such as albuterol or atrovent, may induce hypoxemia resulting from vasodilation and mismatching of ventilation/perfusion. This may occur if the underlying problem is not bronchoconstriction but rather atelectasis or mucous plugging; hence, close observation of the response to the bronchodilator treatment is very important to determine its effectiveness.\n\n3. Methylxanthines, while helpful in relieving bronchospasm in selected infants with BPD, have significant side effects, including tachycardia, seizures, and gastro-esophageal reflux, which may aggravate BPD. If these drugs are used, plasma levels must be monitored to help establish therapeutic efficacy and prevent toxicity. (See NICU Guide Section II.C.6. \"Continuous Infusion Drips Caclucation and Starting Dose\").\n\n<a id='eb9cace7-05ee-4a37-8e46-f5f703ce4653'></a>\n\nH. **Ventilation:**\n1. Over the first few weeks of life, the tidal volume of ventilated neonates increases from 4-5 mL/kg initially to 6-7 mL/kg.\n2. With the development of BPD, there can be an increase in both airways resistance and compliance resulting in \"multi-compartment lung\" pathophysiology.\n3. To manage this in intubated babies with BPD, we usually recommend a strategy involving higher tidal volumes (>6 mL/kg), longer inspiratory times (0.6-0.8 sec), and slower rates (necessary to avoid \"inverse\" I:E Ratios).\n4. This strategy must be individualized, and should be discussed with the Attending on rounds to guide the transition to, and details of, this ventilator management.\n\nI. **Inhaled Nitric Oxide (iNO):** There is considerable experimental evidence that iNO can improve respiratory gas exchange, reduce lung inflammation, improve alveolarization, and reverse pulmonary hypertension and bronchoconstriction in newborn animals with acute and chronic lung injury.\n1. Recent studies of iNO treatment in animal models of BPD have indicated that this treatment strategy may enhance alveolar development and improve lung function in both premature lambs and baboons with evolving BPD. However, clinical studies do not support the routine use of iNO in premature infants.\n2. Selection of appropriate candidates for iNO treatment, as well as timing and dosing of treatment regimens designed to prevent or reduce the severity of BPD, remain important issues for further research.\n3. Potential toxicities of iNO therapy include oxidant lung injury and loss of surfactant function from the production of peroxynitrite, interference with normal platelet function that could affect the incidence of intracranial or pulmonary hemorrhage, and long-term neurodevelopmental disability. Until more reliable information is available on efficacy and toxicity of iNO for premature infants with evolving BPD, this treatment is experimental and should not be undertaken outside of clinical trials.\n\n<a id='bebbaeaa-d0f1-44f7-9557-39fc91578fff'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Measures to treat gastro-esophageal reflux and aspiration of gastric contents:\n\n1. If suspected, an esophageal pH study should be done to test for the presence of reflux and possible apnea in order to establish the severity and frequency of the problem. Whether reflux causes BPD, or is exacerbated by it, is still under investigation.\n\n2. If significant reflux is documented, drugs that might contribute to the problem should be discontinued and anti-reflux medications should be considered.\n\nK. Assessment for vocal cord injury:\n\n1. Stridor or persistent respiratory distress may be a sign of vocal cord injury, which sometimes occurs during cardiovascular surgery, including PDA ligation.\n\n2. This condition can contribute to respiratory symptoms associated with BPD and also prolong weaning from assisted ventilation; thus, vocal cord paralysis should be considered in such situations.\n\n<a id='c15299bb-78c5-410f-b916-49fd07269df0'></a>\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

Definition\n\n1.  Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a chronic, multisystem, lethal recessive disorder that results from defective epithelial chloride transport with major manifestations in the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and reproductive systems.\n2.  The primary morbidity in CF is from progression of obstructive lung disease. A very large percentage of patients with CF have pancreatic insufficiency, which manifests as malabsorption, and insulin deficiency. Male infertility results from congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens or eventual obstruction and scarring of the vas deferens. Other less common problems encountered include cirrhosis of the liver, cholelithiasis, recurrent pancreatitis, gastroesophageal reflux, and gastrointestinal hypomotility.\n3.  The prognosis used to be quite grave and most infants and children did not survive past the age of 5 yrs. Due to the advent of supplemental enzymes to aid in food digestion and absorption, refined methods of chest physiotherapy, and antibiotics, the median survival age for individuals with CF in the U.S. is approximately 36 yrs. There is a wide variability in the severity of symptoms and the rate of decline in pulmonary function. Many patients now are living into their 40s and 50s. It is difficult to predict the life expectancy of a child born in 2017 because of the time delay of the impact of changes in therapy on life expectancy.\n\n<a id='ca601436-bc75-43a7-91b6-26e66274e977'></a>\n\n## II. Incidence\n\nA. CF is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, and both parents are usually asymptomatic carriers of the abnormal mutation. It is the most common lethal genetic disease affecting Caucasians, with an incidence of approximately 1 in 2,700 live births with a corresponding carrier frequency of 1 in 32. In the Mexican-American population, the incidence is approximately 1 in 4,500 live births. CF occurs in people of African descent, with the incidence in African-Americans at approximately 1 in 17,000 live births. The disease is extremely rare in persons of native African and of Asian descent.\n\nB. The gene that encodes for the chloride channel affected in CF is located on chromosome 7. Over 2,000 mutations have been identified to date. The gene encodes a protein of 1,480 amino acids called the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR). The most common mutation found in persons of Anglo-Saxon descent is the ΔF508 mutation, and is found in approximately 75% of patients with CF. The Δ F508 mutation is a 3 base pair deletion that results in deletion of a phenylalanine at position 508 of the protein sequence. There is a correlation between genotype and pancreatic status, but there is no correlation of specific mutations with pulmonary phenotype. Some of the CFTR mutations are associated with more severe disease expression than others, and ΔF508 is one of the mutations most commonly associated with the \"severe\" phenotype. Conversely, patients with mutations correlated with normal pancreatic function tend to have a \"milder\" CF phenotype.\n\n<a id='531a1ce3-05e1-49a5-a494-ed2e0b50bf81'></a>\n\n### III. Pathophysiology\n\nA. CF involves several organ systems, including the lungs, pancreas, intestines, hepatobiliary tract, genitourinary tract, and sweat duct. The common physiologic feature of these organs is CFTR-mediated ion transport. The exact pathophysiologic mechanism where altered ion and water transport across the epithelia of these organs is not fully described and our understanding of how CFTR dysfunction leads to organ dysfunction is a matter of much debate, but certain theories persist.\n\nB. The CF defect is characterized by a reduced ability of epithelial cells in the airways and pancreas to secrete chloride. CFTR also has a negative regulatory effect on the sodium absorption across the airway epithelium. Thus, enhanced absorption of sodium from the airway lumen and little chloride secretion into the airway leads to decreased fluid presence in the airway. This is thought to lead to relatively dehydrated respiratory (and\n\n<a id='2f38d98e-c61c-4578-928e-e0edf9e5f9b2'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital. No representations or warranties are made for outside use.

The earliest evidence of airway obstruction occurs at the level of the bronchioles with mucus plugging and inflammation consistent with bronchiolitis. Mucus plugging and inflammation extend from the bronchioles and progressively affect the larger airways over time. The pathologic features of airway abnormalities in CF include inflammatory cell infiltration of the airways, goblet cell hyperplasia, and submucosal gland hypertrophy. The CF airway is also predisposed to bacterial colonization. Chronic infection and inflammation of the airways leads to bronchiectasis and peribronchial fibrosis.\n\n<a id='30231fb4-84bf-42a2-b8e8-a5c33ca48430'></a>\n\nD. Mucociliary clearance is also greatly impaired in patients with CF. This process is manifest in most patients within the first few days of birth. Lungs fill with mucus quickly. All infants need to receive chest physiotherapy and inhale medications regularly in order to maintain good pulmonary function and minimize the rate of pulmonary deterioration over the long-term.\n\n<a id='eee4e490-e0bd-44a2-903d-e0363485fe62'></a>\n\nE. As mentioned above, patients with CF eventually become colonized with certain types of bacteria, namely Staphylococcus aureus, Hemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Colonization with S. aureus and H. influenzae is common in infants and younger children. By the age of 10, approximately 75% of children with CF are colonized by Pseudomonas.\n\n<a id='91d28c5e-bd10-463d-8c79-f0c083e87d96'></a>\n\nF. Another classic pathologic feature of the CF airway is the infiltration of inflammatory cells into the airways, even in early lung disease and in patients who are not yet colonized by bacteria. Neutrophils obtained from the respiratory secretions of CF patients of all ages are deficient in glutathione (GSH). GSH is a peptide that plays a crucial role in maintaining a balance of cellular mechanisms that regulate the oxidative effects of the inflammatory response. Neutrophil elastase appears to be a major player in the pathogenesis of cystic and bronchiectatic changes by way of constant damage to the bronchiolar and bronchial mucosa and airway structural proteins.\n\n<a id='bcac03ec-bd2d-4ece-a8b7-57367bc8e056'></a>\n\nIV. Diagnosis\n\nA. The \"Sweat Test\"\n\n1. The gold-standard test to diagnose CF is the \"sweat test\" or the pilocarpine iontophoresis test. The sweat glands of CF patients are less able to reabsorb chloride from sweat than normal people are. This leads to a very high level of chloride in the sweat and a reliable method of diagnosis. Premature infants have not developed mature sweat glands, but usually by the time a term infant is 3 wks of age, the test will be successful.\n\na. The possibility of a false positive sweat test exists. The causes include: adrenal insufficiency, ectodermal dysplasia, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, type I glycogen storage disease, anorexia nervosa, hypoparathyroidism, familial cholestatic syndromes, malnutrition and hypoalbuminemia, hypothyroidism, mucopolysaccharidoses, and fucosidosis.\n\n2. Newborn Screening for Cystic Fibrosis\n\na. Screening for cystic fibrosis at the time of birth has led to early identification of CF with a resultant positive impact on the nutritional status of young children with CF.\n\nb. Beginning in August 2007, the California legislature mandated the addition of testing for cystic fibrosis with measurement of serum immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) to the newborn screening panel.\n\ni. 4-step screening algorithm:\n\na) Serum IRT measuring \\u2265 the upper 2.2% of IRT measured on that day in newborn infants.\n\n<a id='21a0f6f5-34da-4242-8311-fdae4d825de0'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

The Pediatrician and parents will be notified of this result.\nd) If 2 mutations are positive, the baby's pediatrician and parents will be notified of the result, referral to local CF center will be facilitated, and the CF center will coordinate sweat testing.\ni. By this algorithm and the cut-off for elevated IRT, it is calculated that of the 78 new CF cases expected to occur each year, based on population demographics, that 75 will be correctly identified, giving a 96% sensitivity to the screen.\n\n<a id='9d462ee5-412d-48df-99f0-b31411c0e228'></a>\n\n### 3. Cystic Fibrosis Metabolic Syndrome\n\na. CF metabolic syndrome (CRMS) is used in the United States to describe infants with elevated levels of immunoreactive trypsinogen, sweat chloride values less than 60 mmol/L, and one to two CFTR mutations, at least one of which is not clearly categorized as CF causing. The degree of risk of developing CF among infants diagnosed with CRMS is unclear. Because of this risk, the CF Foundation recommends repeating a sweat test outside of the first 6 months of life and routine follow up in a specialized CF clinic for these infants but do not recommend interventions in the absence of symptoms suspicious for CF.\n\n<a id='892a7a7b-5ca5-4fc0-bd54-8a6da2e3112f'></a>\n\nB. **Adjunctive Testing for Newborns**\n\n1.  **Serum for CF DNA** - as stated above, in general, this is a less sensitive test than the sweat test in many populations, due to the fact that the panel of mutations that are routinely checked at the Stanford Clinical laboratory includes 24 of the most common mutations known for the Caucasian population and adds 5 more thought to be more common in the Hispanic population. This takes about 7 days to return.\n2.  **Many more mutations exist** - and it is not uncommon to receive a result that identifies only one CF mutation. This DOES NOT exclude CF from the differential. More extensive genetic analysis can be obtained from Ambry Genetics, a laboratory that sequences nearly the entire CF genome of samples. This may be requested as the initial DNA analysis for patients with different ethnic backgrounds than Northern European Caucasians. This takes about 14-21 days to return.\n3.  **Stool elastase quantification** - A small amount of stool may be obtained and sent for elastase quantification. The lower limit of normal that is selected to be the most sensitive and specific for true pancreatic exocrine insufficiency is 200 cg/gm stool.\n\n<a id='becf0e56-c331-45a7-b8c5-173b2953ecd1'></a>\n\n<::This is a flowchart illustrating a screening process for Cystic Fibrosis (CF).\n\n1.  The process begins with \"IRT (all babies)\" (Initial Reactive Trypsinogen test).\n2.  A decision point follows, based on the \"IRT\" result.\n    *   If the IRT result is \"<99th centile\", it leads to \"Low risk of CF. No further tests. No results reported by screening lab.\"\n    *   If the IRT result is \"≥99th centile\", it proceeds to \"CFTR mutation analysis\" (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator).\n3.  The \"CFTR mutation analysis\" is another decision point:\n    *   If \"No mutations\" are found, it leads to \"Low risk of CF. No further tests. No results reported by screening lab.\"\n    *   If \"1 mutation\" is found, it leads to \"Perform sweat test.\"\n    *   If \"2 mutations\" are found, it leads to \"CF confirmed.\"\n: flowchart::>\n\n<a id='55c7865e-0b29-4409-95b4-c69d7a2952d8'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

This is a surgical emergency and may result in intestinal perforation. In the instance of intestinal perforation, an ileostomy and ileal resection are often necessary.\n\nB. **The most common clinical manifestation for infants with CF is respiratory.** Infants frequently present with recurrent episodes of wheezing and respiratory distress (bronchiolitis) and pneumonia. Interestingly, the RUL is the most commonly affected lobe initially. Infants and children may also suffer from atelectasis or pneumothorax and respiratory failure can easily occur in infants with severe inflammation and infection.\n\nC. **The pathophysiology for most of the other organs affected in CF is similar to that of the lungs.** Therefore, in most patients born with CF, the pancreas is severely affected. At the time of birth, the pancreatic ducts are obstructed with inspissated secretions. The ducts and acini are dilated and eventually form cystic changes. Fibrosis ensues as the organ slowly proceeds to autolyse over time. This results in decreased secretion of digestive enzymes into the intestine, and contributes to malabsorption and steatorrhea, classic signs of pancreatic dysfunction. At a critical point, the pancreas is sufficiently damaged such that the CF patient becomes deficient in insulin production and glucose intolerance and diabetes ensue.\n\n<a id='26ed191b-4cf2-42d3-8185-256a88fcf19c'></a>\n\nVI. Management\n\nA. The management of CF can be very complicated due to multi-system involvement and a high frequency of complications. For these reasons, a comprehensive and intensive therapy program is essential. Outpatients are seen at intervals of 2-3 mos by a physician experienced in CF and its manifestations. The CF \"Team\" approach is most beneficial for the patients, and includes Nursing, Nutrition, Physical therapy, Respiratory Therapy, and Social work.\n\nB. Pulmonary Treatment of CF begins early and occurs on a daily basis. While newborn infants with CF may appear asymptomatic from a respiratory standpoint, inflammatory processes are initiated immediately upon delivery. The primary goal is to focus on clearance of excess mucus from the tracheobronchial tree. Initial treatment should include inhalation of a β2-agonist followed by manual percussion and postural drainage. Infants born with meconium ileus are known to develop more severe obstruction earlier in life than CF patients who do not have meconium ileus at birth. Thus, these infants with a more \"severe\" presentation would benefit from a more aggressive pulmonary toilet regimen to include the use of anti-inflammatory treatment, though there is no strict protocol for treatment. Patients and families should be educated on the importance of daily assisted mucus clearance.\n\nC. Antibiotics\n\n1. Treatment is generally reserved for acute exacerbations. When possible, antibiotic therapy is guided by the patient's most recent sputum or throat culture. Long- term data obtained from throat cultures of younger children demonstrate that most tend to be colonized with Staphylococcus aureus and/or Hemophilus influenza. As children become older, Pseudomonas aeruginosa throat colonization becomes more prominent, and growth of S. aureus and H. influenza tend to resolve by the teen yrs.\n\n2. If a patient requires hospitalization for CF pneumonia, when treating a gram-negative, lactose non-fermenting bacillus such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, double antibiotic therapy is utilized in order to achieve a synergistic bactericidal effect. The most common antibiotic regimens utilize an aminoglycoside such as tobramycin combined with a third-generation semisynthetic penicillin or a cephalosporin that has adequate anti-pseudomonal activity (ceftazidime or cefepime).\n\n3. CF patients require very high doses of most medications to achieve therapeutic serum levels. Aminoglycosides bind covalently to the DNA that is abundant in the CF airway, and the volume of distribution of the drug is increased. In particular, in the absence of renal dysfunction, aminoglycoside\n\n<a id='112112cd-a729-40a6-a8dc-1441077f6da1'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Pre-dose serum levels must be assessed to assure the least toxicity to the patient, but post-dose levels are generally sought to be at least 9 mg/dL but not more than 13 mg/mL.\n\n<a id='f852ae6a-888a-412c-8624-7894fa2e4c17'></a>\n\nD. **Corticosteroid Therapy**\n\nAdditions to the CF pharmaceutical regime intended to diminish the chronic inflammation of the airways include corticosteroid therapy and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication.\n\n<a id='f3d4419d-461d-4d3e-97eb-bacd505ac66f'></a>\n\n### E. Recombinant Human DNase (rhDNase)\n\nThe sputum in CF is more abundant and has increased viscosity because of increased glycoprotein sulfation and DNA released from dead neutrophils present in high concentration in the airways. Newborn infants may experience episodes of mucus plugging and/or atelectasis, particularly those who are sedated and mechanically intubated. The dose is one vial per nebulization; it comes in a concentration of 2.5 mg/2.5 mL. The usual frequency of use is once a day, though for patients with atelectasis, twice a day.\n\n<a id='146ee895-ddc0-45b7-9912-afe7cf788512'></a>\n\nF. **Hypertonic Saline nebulization (7% solution)**\n\nThis treatment is a relatively recent addition to the potential regimen for CF patients to maintain airways clearance. In randomized, placebo-controlled trials, it has been demonstrated that subjects had fewer episodes of pulmonary exacerbation requiring IV antibiotic use and fewer hospitalizations. In infants, however, this advantage was not proved, nor was there any benefit seen in maintenance of lung function compared to placebo. It is becoming standard of care in most CF regimens for children 5 years and older.\n\n<a id='93d57342-8a9d-484b-99f1-dee12ead5539'></a>\n\nG. Gastrointestinal\n\n1. GI symptoms are typical for patients with CF, but treatment with oral pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy is often all that is needed to improve and maintain adequate nutritional status and minimize malabsorption, steatorrhea, constipation, and diarrhea.\n\n2. Pancreatic enzymes are obtained primarily from porcine pancreas and available in powder or capsule form. The amount of enzyme dosage per capsule varies. The dose of enzyme given is based on the patient's weight, and most patients are maintained on doses of 500-5000 lipase units/kg/meal. The capsules contain small microencapsulated enzymes, which are protected from acid digestion in the stomach, and are most active in the duodenum and ileum, where the pH is alkaline. Since the patients who require enzyme replacement therapy are, by definition, pancreatic insufficient, they may require concomitant doses of antacid to maximize the activity of the pancreatic enzyme in the small intestine.\n\n2. For infants, the capsule is opened, and the tiny beads are either poured directly into the infants mouth, or the beads or placed in the tip of a nipple and \"dissolved\" in a tiny bit of formula. Enzymes are administered orally immediately before each meal. The infant first takes this, then is given the bottle of formula or breast-fed. Sometimes, the powdered form is added to the formula, but this leads to immediate curdling of the formula and seems to make the formula taste bad. Many infants reject this.\n\n<a id='450c02e4-21d7-40e2-a03c-1658eeb149a4'></a>\n\nH. **CFTR Protein Correctors and Potentiators**\n\n1. Several classes of dysfunction related to CFTR gene mutations have been described.\n\n**Class I** – Defective protein production. This defect is usually caused by nonsense, frameshift, or splice-site mutations and leads to absence of protein production.\n\n<a id='bb2241a4-fbe0-4c39-a9cb-365358734ea3'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

This causes abnormal post-translational processing of the CFTR protein trafficking to the correct cellular location. Delta F508 mutation is the most representative of this class, as it is degraded in the Golgi complex.\n\n**Class III** - Defective regulation. These lead to diminished channel activity in response to ATP. The G551D mutation is the most common mutation that causes this type of dysfunction.\n\n<a id='a13329a5-0062-48de-8aba-ec6adffa144e'></a>\n\nClass IV – Defective conduction – the protein is correctly localized to the apical surface of the cell, but the channel opening and conductance of chloride through the channel is decreased and not easily activated.\n\n<a id='e0a54b63-3534-4854-9eac-447549a5dba5'></a>\n\n**Class V** – Reduced amounts of functional CFTR protein.\n\n<a id='9abee26b-5d82-4109-b5ec-08c36af99ecb'></a>\n\nClass VI – Altered stability of the mature CFTR protein in the cell membrane.\n\n<a id='02fe7450-cd39-4174-8f53-376e4a605c5d'></a>\n\n2. While there is no drug developed yet that targets the most common mutations, there has been development of an oral pharmaceutical (Ivacaftor) that is able to correct the function of CFTR protein that has the G551D mutation, and leads to normal CFTR protein function as evidenced by normalization of the sweat chloride conductance in the chloride iontophoresis test, as well as marked improvement and normalization of lung function abnormalities. The drug treatment accounts for 4% of the total CF population. Other gene mutations for which ivacaftor (KALYDECO®) has been approved as of March 18, 2015 for use in children ages 2 and older with cystic fibrosis (CF) who have one of 10 mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene (G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N, S549R and R117H).\n\n<a id='39b80e4b-a20e-4021-a1b3-714c1885f6d4'></a>\n\n3. Orkambi is another product approved for use in CF patients who are homozygous for the F508del mutation, which comprises approximately 50% of the CF population. The F508del mutation interferes with CFTR protein folding and channel gating activity. Lumacaftor (VX-809) partially corrects the CFTR misfolding while ivacaftor improves the gating abnormality. Unfortunately, neither drug is effective when used alone for F508del homozygotes. Combination therapy with lumacaftor-ivacaftor decreased sweat chloride concentration in a phase 2 trial, and was then evaluated in two similarly designed clinical trials (TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT trials), reported in a combined analysis. Dosing is as follows:\n\n<a id='286d3ea8-5592-4c04-85b7-de71beec1fb4'></a>\n\na.

In the newborn, the most frequent and serious complication is that of meconium ileus with intestinal perforation.\n\nB. Older children and adults can suffer other types of complications that are a result of the scarring and fibrosis that occurs in the lungs, liver, and pancreas.\n\n1. **Hemoptysis**: Patients often experience blood streaking of their sputum. This is probably due to rupture of surface capillaries secondary to vigorous coughing. A larger danger exists if bleeding occurs due to erosion of bronchial arteries into a bronchus. This most often occurs in association with a pulmonary exacerbation. It occurs in <10% of adults and rarely in children and it is estimated that 1% of all patients die from massive hemoptysis.\n2. **Pneumothorax** occurs in 8-23% of older CF patients but can occur in children with severe disease. The mortality rate is about 4% if pneumothorax occurs and the median survival after pneumothorax occurs is\n\n<a id='8349d865-25cd-42c4-ab98-46a425488ddb'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

One of the disadvantages is that that amount of medication delivered to the patient is estimated to be 10%. Particle size may vary depending on the type of nebulizer used. Treatment time can last up to 20 min. Patients on mechanical ventilation may require adjustments in their ventilator settings during the treatment.\n2.  **Ordering:** by milligram or strength of solution (e.g., Albuterol 2.5 mg every 4 hrs).\n\nB. **Metered Dose Inhalers (MDI):**\n\n1.  **Use:** MDIs are given to neonates using mask and spacer or in-line for ventilated patients. The advantages are portability, efficient drug delivery, and short preparation time. For ventilated patients, ventilator settings do not have to be altered during treatment delivery. The disadvantages are fixed drug concentrations, limited choice of drugs, possible reaction to the propellants, and oropharyngeal deposition.\n2.  **Ordering:** These medications are ordered by the \"puff.\" For ventilated patients the dose should be increased, as medication impacts on the endotracheal tube (ETT).\n\n<a id='2dbda1c4-db61-4597-912a-5d4278dfe9b0'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Medications via ETTs:\n\nDeposition of aerosolized medications may be reduced due to resistance of the ETT. Intubated patients may require higher than usual doses to achieve therapeutic effect.\n\n<a id='502141d3-beeb-4410-91f3-9909498807ba'></a>\n\n## III. Respiratory Care Medications Administered by Inhalation\n\n<a id='53bf18f5-152d-4fdc-b3a4-03919f455262'></a>\n\nA. Anticholinergics (parasympatholytic) Bronchodilators\n\nThe potential for bronchodilation by parasympatholytic agents is based on the premise that the parasympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system maintains a basal tone in bronchial smooth muscle and possibly exerts an abnormally active role in hyper-reactive airway diseases such as asthma. To the extent that the parasympathetic branch causes airway constriction in disease, agents that block parasympathetic receptors will prevent bronchoconstriction.\n\n1. Ipratropium Bromide (Atrovent®):\n\ta. Use: Ipratropium bromide is an anticholinergic agent that has a local, site-specific effect, not a systemic one. It is indicated for the treatment of the bronchospastic symptoms. It is often used in conjunction with other bronchodilators, especially beta adrenergics, and prevents bronchoconstriction. Ipratropium bromide has been demonstrated to exert its effects primarily on the more central airways. It may be useful for decreasing secretion in the central airways.\n\ti. How supplied:\n\t\ta) Ipratropium MDI: CFC free 17 mcg/inh\n\n\t\tDose: The pediatric (<12 yrs old) dose is 2 puffs given every 4-6 hrs, the total 24-hr dose should not exceed 12 puffs or 0.24 mg. Insufficient clinical data exist with respect to dosage for patients <12 yrs old.\n\n\t\tb) Ipratropium bromide 0.02% solution: 500 mcg in 2.5 ml normal saline unit dose\n\n\t\tDose: The adult dose is 500 mcg (1 unit dose vial) administered 3-4 times per day by oral nebulization, with doses 6-8 hrs apart. Safety, efficacy, and dose in children <12 yrs has not been established. Various dosages have been described in the literature.\n\n<a id='eeaafe2a-8182-4171-b3b4-2e3a785cadfb'></a>\n\nB. Alpha and Beta Adrenergic stimulation\n\n1.  Racemic epinephrine (Vaponefrin®, Micronefrin):\n\n    i.  **Use:** In contrast to other sympathomimetics, racemic epinephrine is administered for its effect on the adrenergic alpha receptors, which cause vasoconstriction and decongestion in the nose and upper airway, reducing some airway edema. Racemic epinephrine is used to increase the caliber of an edematous airway, specifically for croup, and post-extubation stridor. Regular use is not recommended.\n\n<a id='14960ffd-644f-4751-93d7-16b7b16a501f'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Sympathomimetic Bronchodilators\n\n1. Use: Sympathomimetic bronchodilators act by stimulating the beta-2 receptors of the sympathetic nervous system to increase the concentration of cyclic AMP, causing bronchial smooth muscle relaxation. These agents are indicated for patients with lung disease who have a reversible airway obstruction. Since these agents can also increase both cardiac contraction and rate, the patient's HR must be monitored before, during, and after these agents are given. Children who do not have heart disease may be treated with bronchodilators at HR up to 200 bpm. In children with heart disease or HR bpm >200 bpm, use with caution. All orders must include pulse range restrictions. Generally, doses should be adjusted to patient response, and administered when patient is symptomatic. Albuterol does not prevent bronchospasm; it reverses it. An alternative is to use levalbuterol, which is the L-isomer of albuterol.\n\n<a id='a52fd3bc-49a3-4c5b-a6bf-bc6fdee0f25f'></a>\n\na. **Albuterol (Proventil®, Ventolin®)**\n\nAlbuterol has very little beta-1 adrenergic effect and can be utilized in relatively large doses at frequent intervals.\n\ni. **How supplied:**\n\na) Albuterol solution 0.5%: 5 mg/ml (average treatment-2.5 mg every 4 hrs).\n\n   **Dilute:** 0.1-0.5 ml every 4-6 hrs prn in 2 ml dilution.\n\nb) Pre-mixed (0.083%): 0.5-1 unit dose neb every 4-6 hrs prn\n\nc) Albuterol MDI: CFC free 90 mcg/inh\n\n   **Dose:** 1-2 inhalations 4 times/day.\n\n<a id='996c79d3-9e63-43e8-a237-cbd01b15d666'></a>\n\nb. **Levalbuterol (Xopenex®)**\n\nLittle to no beta-1 adrenergic effect.\n\ni. **How supplied:** (0.31mg/3ml), (0.63/3ml) and (1.25mg/3ml).\n\n**Dose:** Give 1 unit dose no more than every 6 hrs. Generally, every 8 hrs is sufficient for stable patients.\n\n<a id='fcbf5105-3232-4a5e-b23c-fa3d0f614e36'></a>\n\nD. Corticosteroids\n\nThe primary purposes of inhaled corticosteroids are to treat asthma through the anti-inflammatory effect and to reduce tracheal inflammation. Inhaled corticosteroids have greater effect topically and less effect systemically. Controlled clinical studies have shown that orally inhaled and intranasal corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity in pediatric patients. In studies of orally-inhaled corticosteroids, the mean reduction in growth velocity was approximately 1 cm/yr (range 0.3-1.8 cm/yr) and appears to be related to dose and duration of exposure. To minimize the systemic effects of orally inhaled and intranasal corticosteroids, each patient should be titrated to the lowest effective dose.\n\n<a id='66e0c2fa-96db-4496-9910-8001e9bb828c'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

May be systemically absorbed in high doses.\n\ni. **How supplied**: Beclomethasone MDI, 80 mcg/inh\n\n**Dose**: Children (6-12) 1-2 inhalations 3-4/day. The maximum dose should not exceed 10 inhalations, 400 mcg, in 24 hrs.\n\n<a id='9be2798d-cc03-4329-a111-ff88860d9845'></a>\n\n3. **Budesonide (Pulmicort®):**\n\na. **Use:** Has anti-inflammatory effects, reduces airway edema, hyperreactivity, and may reduce need for bronchodilator.\n\ni. **How supplied:** Available as nebulized solution (0.25 mg/2 ml and 0.5 mg/2 ml) or DPI (90 mcg/inh, 180 mcg/inh).\n\n**Dose:** Neb 0.5-1 unit dose neb daily or Q12hrs, and DPI is 1-2 puffs daily or Q12hrs.\n\n<a id='7885797d-ec4a-40ad-8234-805ba9a27add'></a>\n\nE. Mucolytics\n\n1.  Acetylcysteine (Mucomyst®, Mucosil®)\n\n    a.  **Use:** Acetylcysteine contains a free sulfhydryl group that breaks down the disulfide bonds of mucoid sputum. Acetylcysteine may be helpful in lung diseases characterized by viscid mucus retention. Since acetylcysteine can provoke severe bronchospasm, we recommend a bronchodilator be administered concurrently.\n\n        i.  **How supplied:**\n\n            a)  Acetylcysteine 10%: 100 mg/mL.\n            b)  Acetylcysteine 20%: 200 mg/mL.\n\n    **Dose:** Infants - 2 ml of 5% solution 2-4/day.\n\n2.  Dornase Alpha, rhDNase (Pulmozyme®)\n\n<a id='3a0b71b3-318a-46dc-b1d4-0fd782fb134c'></a>\n\na. **Use:** Pulmozyme® hydrolyzes the DNA in sputum of cystic fibrosis patients and reduces sputum viscoelasticity. This is useful in patients who have infectious pulmonary processes to liberate purulent secretions. DNase greatly reduces the viscosity of purulent cystic fibrosis sputum, decreases the adhesiveness of cystic fibrosis sputum, and augments mucociliary clearance.\n\n<a id='4c45a881-e43b-4d5a-a242-088408453dce'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Inhaled Antibiotics\n\n1. Tobramycin (TOBI)\n\na. Use: Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside that inhibits cell wall synthesis of gram-negative organisms. It is used primarily for patients with cystic fibrosis, but can be used effectively and with a minimum of systemic absorption to avoid renal toxicity for patients with tracheostomies who have symptoms of tracheitis or bronchitis due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa or other gram-negative species sensitive to tobramycin.\n\ni. How supplied: 300 mg/5 mL, preservative-free.\n\nDose: one vial nebulized Q12.\n\n<a id='8cbdebad-36b6-490a-b242-cdafc0a48839'></a>\n\n2. Aztreonam (Cayston)\n\na. **Use:** aztreonam is a synthetic monocyclic b-lactam that inhibits cell wall synthesis of gram-negative organisms. It is used primarily for patients with cystic fibrosis, but can be used effectively and with a minimum of systemic absorption to avoid renal toxicity for patients with tracheostomies who have symptoms of tracheitis or bronchitis due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa or other gram-negative species sensitive to tobramycin.\n\ni. **How supplied:** 75 mg/2 mL, preservative free\n\n**Dose:** one vial nebulized TID for 28-day cycles, given every other month\n\n<a id='e06e31f5-da8c-4703-8436-296902d85eb5'></a>\n\n3. Colistimethate (Colistin)\n\na. Use: colistimethate is a polycationic and has both hydrophilic and lipophilic moieties. These poly-cationic regions interact with the bacterial outer membrane, by displacing bacterial counter ions in the lipopolysaccharide. Hydrophobic/hydrophillic regions interact with the cytoplasmic membrane just like a detergent, solubilizing the membrane in an aqueous environment. This effect is bactericidal even in an isosmolaric environment. It is used primarily for patients with cystic fibrosis, but can be used effectively and with a minimum of systemic absorption to avoid renal toxicity for patients with tracheostomies who have symptoms of tracheitis or bronchitis due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa or generally other other gram-negative species resistant to tobramycin and other antibiotics.\n\n<a id='b33469c0-8206-40da-a44c-66161952bf0d'></a>\n\ni. **How supplied**: 150 mg/2 mL, preservative free\n\n**Dose**: one vial nebulized BID for 28-day cycles, given every other month\n\n<a id='290c90e3-c8b1-4206-9a60-ef91f8d03029'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Patients with low cardiac output or congestive heart failure may have peripheral vasoconstriction caused by increased circulating catecholamines.\n2. Neonates with left heart obstructive lesions become symtomatic when the PDA begins to close. Once this occurs, there is decreased systemic perfusion that leads to the development of metabolic acidosis, which further compromises cardiac function.\n3. Infants with low cardiac output usually have weak pulses; however, those with systemic artery-to-pulmonary artery connections may have bounding pulses despite decreased systemic blood flow. Those infants with weak pulses or absent pulses in the lower extremities may have an interrupted aortic arch or coarctation.\n\nD. **Liver**:\nUsually found at 1-2 fingers width below the right costal margin. If lower than that, one must consider congestive heart failure.\n\nE. **Respiratory Pattern**:\nInfants with CHD may present with signs of respiratory distress, especially in cases of pulmonary overcirculation or with defects leading to metabolic acidosis.\n\nF. **Dysmorphic Features**:\n1. Unusual features possibly related to a genetic syndrome should prompt a Genetics consult and chromosome analysis. See Appendix A: Genetic Testing Algorithm for Complex CHD Patients.\n2. If the heart lesion is a conotruncal heart malformation (e.g., truncus arteriosus, Tetralogy of Fallot, interrupted aortic arch type B, conoventricular septal defects), a microdeletion of chromosome 22, otherwise known as DiGeorge syndrome or velocardiofacial syndrome (VCF), may be present. FISH for 22q11 deletion should be ordered as part of the chromosomal work up. If 22q11 deletion is diagnosed, further endocrine/immunologic work-up is indicated (See NICU Guide Section II.J. \"[22q11 Deletion Syndrome](https://example.com/22q11_Deletion_Syndrome)\").\n3. Chromosomal anomalies causing both cardiac and non-cardiac defects also include Trisomy 13, Trisomy 18, Trisomy 21, and Monosomy X (Turner syndrome). Cardiac defects are also seen with VACTERL and CHARGE.\n\n<a id='afd66309-e76b-4967-be26-a6eb8538e43c'></a>\n\nG. Heart Auscultation:\n\n1. Soft systolic murmurs heard at the right lower sternal border are often tricuspid regurgitation that may be consistent with transient neonatal myocardial ischemia (possibly related to a history of a difficult delivery).\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Elevated pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary arterial pressure in conjunction with pulmonary vasoreactivity characterize PPHN. This produces right-to-left shunting at the PDA and PFO. It results in hypoxemia from extra-pulmonary shunting which can be poorly responsive to medical management. PPHN is felt to represent failure of the pulmonary circulation to adapt to post-natal conditions and as such is sometimes called “persistent fetal circulation”. The pulmonary vascular bed is abnormal with extension of the medial smooth muscle layer into the smaller and more peripheral intraacinar vessels.",

Clinical presentation is hypoxemia that is out of proportion to the degree of parenchymal lung disease. It has been called \"black-lung\" PPHN, due to the lack of pulmonary vascular markings on chest radiograph.\n\nB. **Parenchymal lung disease:** PPHN frequently accompanies meconium aspiration syndrome, respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis and/or pneumonia. In these settings, evidence of PPHN is seen in addition to intra-pulmonary shunting from parenchymal lung disease.\n\nC. **Lung hypoplasia:** Lung hypoplasia can be seen with congenital diaphragmatic hernia and in infants with premature prolonged rupture of the membranes and longstanding oligohydramnios. In these conditions, lung growth and development are affected and there is a variable degree of lung hypoplasia. This results in a decrease in the cross-sectional area of the pulmonary vascular bed, with subsequent pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary vasoconstriction.\n\nD. **Rare, fatal conditions:** Respiratory failure and PPHN can be the presenting features in Surfactant Protein B (SPB) deficiency, alveolar capillary dysplasia (ACD), and lymphangiectasia.",

Treatment\n\nA. **Identify infants** at risk for PPHN: Infants with meconium in the amniotic fluid should be monitored with pulse oximetry following birth. Infants at risk for PPHN should be monitored for signs of respiratory distress and desaturation. UAC placement should be considered in infants at risk of PPHN who have respiratory distress. Differential pre/post-ductal saturations reflect shunting at the ductal level. Hypoxemia in PPHN is typically labile and not fixed as it is in cyanotic congenital heart disease. ECHO is the best method to evaluate for PPHN and rule-out congenital heart disease.\n\nB. Promptly treat hypoxemia and acidosis: Hypoxemia and acidosis increase pulmonary vascular resistance and should be promptly addressed.\n\nC. Assure adequate cardiac output by maintaining a mean arterial pressure >45 in a term or near-term infant. This may be achieved with a combination of either volume boluses or pressors. Dopamine is the first line drug. ECHO can evaluate right and left heart function and guide management of blood pressure. Central arterial and venous pressure monitoring is desirable to guide therapy.\n\nD. Maintain adequate oxygen carrying capacity by keeping the hematocrit between 40 and 50. Hematocrits in",

Intubation and mechanical ventilation for infants with continued instability of oxygenation: Both hypo and hyperinflation may increase PVR. Gentle ventilation strategies should be used to minimize iatrogenic lung injury. Goal lung expansion is 8-9 ribs.\n\nF. If there is evidence of pulmonary hypertension clinically or on ECHO, the suggested target ABGs are: pH 7.35-7.45, PaCO2 35-50 and PaO2 60-80. PaCO2 values under 35 will decrease cerebral blood flow and increase the risk for brain injury. Hyperventilation and alkalinization may negatively impact cerebral perfusion and increase the risk of sensorineural hearing loss. Avoid using 100% oxygen, goal preductal saturation is > 92 - 95%. In certain patients such as those with CDH, post-ductal saturations in the 70s – 80s may be tolerated if serum lactate is < 3 and there is adequate urine output. Consider use of NIRS in this patient population to monitor for cerebral vasoconstriction. High frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) may be considered to achieve the above blood gas targets.\n\nG. Minimize stress by reducing unnecessary handling and noise.\n\nH. Assure appropriate sedation and analgesia. The drugs of choice are morphine and versed given as continuous infusions.

Infants with lung injury and respiratory failure may have a secondary surfactant deficiency. A masked randomized trial reported a significant reduction in the need for ECMO with surfactant therapy. Subgroup analysis showed the greatest benefit in the group with OI 15-22. Consider using a test dose in unstable infants.\n\nC. **Inhaled nitric oxide therapy (iNO)**: See section V\n\nD. **ECMO**: See NICU Guide Section II:B\n\nE. **Milrinone**: Milrinone increases cardiac output and lowers systemic vascular resistance as well as pulmonary vascular resistance.

Nitric Oxide Dosing Strategy - Refer to algorithm (see figure).\n2.  Acute Deterioration During Initial Dosing - If the patient experiences a significant deterioration during initial dosing requiring a change in vent settings or performance of a procedure (e.g., chest tube placement), iNO use should be discontinued and initial dosing repeated once the patient has stabilized.\n3.  Exit Criteria\n    a. NO2 levels >5 ppm.\n    b. Methemoglobin levels >10%.\n    c. Deterioration in patient's condition felt to be related to iNO therapy.\n4.  Toxicity - Toxicity related to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) formation and methemoglobinemia (metHb) is rare but important side effects of iNO use. NO2 formation occurs when NO and oxygen are combined in the ventilator circuit. NO2 is measured by the iNOvent continuously. Methemoglobinemia occurs when there is a deficiency or relative deficiency of the enzyme methemoglobin reductase or if high doses of iNO are administered.\n    a. If NO2 ≥3 ppm, wean by 50% (if ≤5 ppm iNO then decrease by 1 ppm) every 15 min until NO2 <3 ppm.\n    b. If NO2 levels >5 ppm, discontinue iNO therapy. If metHb ≥5%, wean by 50% (if ≤5 ppm iNO decrease by 1 ppm) every 15 min until MetHb <5%.\n    c. If metHb levels >10%, discontinue iNO therapy.",

Other Uses of iNO Therapy\n\n1.  **Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH)**: Prospective randomized controlled trials of iNO for CDH have failed to show reduced need for ECMO or reduced mortality. iNO is, nonetheless, used in CDH patients with refractory hypoxemia prior to ECMO as a rescue therapy. It has been shown to be helpful in the CDH patients post-repair. In addition, some CDH patients have prolonged pulmonary hypertension despite improvements in respiratory support requirements. These patients may benefit from long-term, low-dose nitric oxide, which may even be delivered by nasal cannula if mechanical ventilation is no longer required. Serial echocardiograms, assessing changes in pulmonary hypertension, should be used to assist in the management of these complex patients.\n\n2.  **Cardiac indications**: iNO has been used for pulmonary hypertension related to cardiac anomalies, particularly in the post-operative phase. Few published data exist regarding outcome, although iNO has been reported to reduce pulmonary artery pressure and possibly reduce the need for ECMO.\n\n3.  **iNO for preterm infants**: Trials in premature infants have been categorized as follows: Early rescue (use in critically ill premature infant unresponsive to surfactant), early prophylactic use (routine use in intubated premature infants), and later use for BPD prevention (use in infants remaining intubated after a week of life).\n\n    a.  Early Rescue use: There were several trials in critically ill infants after birth and the Cochrane meta-analysis showed no benefit on BPD or death. 5 The NICHD Preemie iNO trial6 was the largest in this category and results are as follows:\n\n        i.  No benefit to survival or in reduction of rate of physiologic BPD in infants with severe RDS.\n\n        ii. Subgroup analysis suggested that infants >1000 gm may benefit in terms of the outcome of death or BPD however infants ≤1000 g had higher mortality and increased rates of severe IVH.\n\n        iii. However, neurodevelopment follow-up from this trial showed no benefit from iNO exposure on death, neurodevelopmental impairment or neurodevelopmental outcomes in early childhood among the severely ill premature infants in this trial. An increased risk of death or moderate-sever cerebral palsy (CP) moderate-severe CP was seen among survivors given iNO.\n\n    b.  Early prophylactic use: Three large trials were completed in this subgroup. A single center study by Schreiber showed a significant reduction in BPD and death; however, this was not reproduced in two subsequent large trials.\n\n    c.  Later use for BPD prevention: One large RCT enrolled newborns between 7 and 21 days of life if they remained intubated or on CPAP and treated them for a minimum of 24 days with iNO. Results found improved survival without BPD. An industry sponsored study was performed to confirm these results and no benefit was seen. This study has not yet been published, but the results were presented at Hot Topics in 2013. Of interest, sub-group analysis found evidence of benefit in black population which has biologic plausibility due to differences in bioavailability of NO in persons who self-identify as black.\n\n    d.  An individual patient data meta-analysis, NIH Consensus Conference statement and AAP Committee on Fetus and Newborn do NOT recommend iNO for routine use in premature infants. iNO has not been consistently shown to be effective in reducing rates of BPD or death.\n\n    e.  Of note, the NIH Consensus Conference statement recognized that there are specific clinical situations, and subgroup and post-hoc study findings that point to a potential iNO benefit among preterm infants. One such group is premature infants with PPROM. oligohydramnios, pulmonary hypoplasia and likely pulmonary hypertension. Several case studies have suggested benefit and a sub-group analysis from the NICHD Preemie iNO trial showed positive effects on oxygenation, BPD",

Infants with Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH) who have respiratory distress from birth often have significant mortality despite aggressive medical intervention.\n\nB. The past approach to the patient with CDH utilized hyperventilation, alkalinization, and high mean airway pressures to treat the pulmonary hypoplasia and Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension of the Newborn (PPHN) associated with CDH. These therapies can result in barotrauma and air leak, and may cause iatrogenic lung injury resulting in a higher need for ECMO and lower survival.\n\nC. Severity of CDH can be estimated using antenatal US and MRI. Lung-to-Head Ratio (LHR) and Observed- to- Expected (O/E) LHR are strong predictors of outcome. LHR is determined by the area of the contralateral lung at the level of the four-chamber view of the heart compared to head circumference. LHR is influenced by\n\nGestational age (GA) and is most predictive at 24-34 weeks. An LHR < 1 carries a poor prognosis and cases can be referred for fetal intervention, an LHR of 1-1.4 carries a high risk of ECMO, and an LHR >1.4 carries the best prognosis. Calculation of the O/E LHR incorporates the expected lung volume for GA and thus can be helpful in prognosis regardless of GA at the time of measurement. O/E LHR < 25% is associated with survival rate of < 25%, an O/E LHR of 26-45% is considered moderate risk with survival between 30-60% dependent on liver position, and an O/E LHR > 45% is considered mild. Liver position is an important predictor of outcome with herniation 'up' into the thorax correlating with worse prognosis",

Current Management of Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia**\n\nSince first suggested by Wung, et al, many centers have used \"gentle” ventilation strategies with permissive hypercapnia for critically ill CDH infants. This group reported on the use of this approach in 120 infants with severe CDH; the overall survival was 75.8%, with ECMO needed in only 13.3%. The goal is to avoid lung injury, maintain pre-ductal oxygen saturation >85%, and tolerate moderate hypercapnia as long as the pH is >7.20. Protocolized care for CDH has been shown to improve both morbidity and mortality, as was demonstrated in a publication on a standardized management guideline for CDH by a group of European investigators. The following guidelines have been developed from our own practices and outcomes over the last 25 years as well as from a review of the literature.",

Initial management with conventional ventilation may reduce ventilation days and need for ECMO, although has not been shown to impact mortality and/or BPD.\n    2. **Blood Gas Goals: pH >7.20, PaCO2 50-70, PaO2 >30; Lactic acid < 3.**\n    3. Ventilate with **lowest PIP** (usually 20-24 mmHg) to provide adequate BS, PEEP of 3-5 mmHg, with rate 40-80 and FiO2 starting at 50%. Titrate FiO2 using pre-ductal saturation monitor.\n    4. Surfactant should not be routinely used in term or preterm neonates with CDH. In preterm neonates, there was a trend towards increased mortality in those treated with surfactant.\nF. High frequency oscillatory ventilation should be considered in infants who fail conventional ventilation.\n    1. Failure of conventional ventilation = inability to control CO2 with a max PIP of 25 and rate of 60 or inability to maintain oxygenation with PIP of 25 and PEEP of 5.\n    2.

NS bolus of 10-20 ml/kg for hypotension or poor perfusion. May be repeated x1 prior to starting inotropic agent. Do not administer more than 40ml/kg of crystalloid.\n    2. Initiate Dopamine at 3 mcg/kg/min following crystalloid boluses. Titrate Dopamine to keep MAP at or above gestational age in weeks.\n    3. Consider Hydrocortisone if blood pressure does not improve with appropriate doses of Dopamine.\nH. Sedatives or analgesics should be initiated either in DR (during a prolonged resuscitation) or upon arrival to NICU.\n    1. Provide pain relief with Morphine 0.05-0.1mg/kg q 6 hrs and **lightly** sedate with continuous drip of Midazolam (start at lowest dose).\nI. Place NIRS monitor (cerebral and renal)\nJ. Obtain ECHO within 24 hours after birth. ECHO will evaluate for cardiac anomalies (present in about 25% of CDH patients), heart function, and severity of pulmonary hypertension.",

Consider iNO in patients who cannot maintain pre-ductal saturations >85% or post-ductal PaO2 >30, have a pre/post-ductal saturation differential > 10%, or who show evidence of inadequate oxygen delivery based on rising lactate levels. iNO is initiated at a dose of 20 ppm. Obtain ECHO before initiating iNO if possible. iNO is most helpful in the setting of elevated PVR with right to left shunting at the ductal and atrial level and preductal desaturation. In the setting of left to right shunting at the atrial level and poor LV function, pulmonary vasodilation may worsen left atrial and pulmonary venous hypertension and increase the risk of pulmonary hemorrhage. An RCT did not demonstrate a reduced need for ECMO or death, however iNO use remains common in this patient population and may be used as a bridge to ECMO. Monitor for response to treatment. If there is no response after 1 hour of treatment, iNO may be discontinued. Response to iNO is defined as: a decrease of 10-20% in the pre/post-ductal saturation differential, or an increase of 10-20% in PaO2, or an improvement in hemodynamic parameters (10% increase in blood pressure, or a decrease in lactate levels). If there is no improvement in oxygenation despite maximal ventilator support and iNO then proceed to ECMO.\n2. Small studies and meta-analyses have concluded that ECMO use improves survival in this patient population. Often the usual OI criteria are modified due to the desire to limit barotrauma and pre-ductal saturations are used in conjunction with other clinical data.",

Pulmonary Hypertension Management and Use of Other Vasoactive Medications\n\nPulmonary hypertension in CDH is related to a decreased cross-sectional area of the pulmonary vascular bed with pulmonary hypoplasia and adventitial and medial wall thickening due to increased smooth muscle cells in pulmonary arteries. Increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) can lead to right to left shunting with hypoxemia and pre/post-ductal saturation differential. Shunting may also occur at the level of the foramen ovale, in which case there may not be a significant pre/post-ductal saturation differential. An ECHO should be performed in the first 24 hours after birth to assess for the degree of pulmonary hypertension as well as to evaluate both right and left heart function. If pre-ductal saturations are < 85%, despite changes to ventilator parameters, and there are signs of poor organ perfusion, pulmonary hypertension should be treated. Initial steps include optimizing intravascular volume, transfusion to maintain Hct > 40%, and use of inotropes to maintain blood pressure at normal levels for the gestational age. Following these measures, iNO should be initiated at 20ppm.",

Milrinone, a Phosphodiesterase-3 inhibitor, has been used in CDH associated with elevated PVR and RV dependent systemic circulation due to abnormal LV function. The rationale for its use is three-fold: direct pulmonary vasodilation, improved systolic function; and as a lusitropic agent it improves diastolic function. It has been shown to improve RV systolic and diastolic function by ECHO and improve oxygenation. Doses used range from 0.50-0.75 mcg/kg/min. (0.025-0.75 mg/kg/min).\n\n2. Prostaglandin E1: PGE, has been used in several small studies to maintain ductal patency and stabilize LV and RV function. When there is systemic to supra-systemic pulmonary pressures, the RV becomes overloaded and enlarged. Enlargement of the RV with bowing of the intraventricular septum can impair LV filling and result in poor systemic perfusion. Severe LV dysfunction leads to dependence on the RV for systemic perfusion and thus there may be benefit from strategies to main ductal patency. Doses used are generally 5-10 ng/kg/min (0.005-0.01mcg/kg/min).\n\n3. Sildenafil: Sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor, has primarily been used in the management of chronic pulmonary hypertension in the post-operative period in neonates with CDH. Intravenous sildenafil is available but not FDA approved. There are limited data on efficacy of IV sildenafil for treatment in the acute phase, but in small retrospective cohort studies, sildenafil was associated with ECHO evidence of reduced PVR.",

Initially patients were operated on soon after birth, but in the 1990s there was a change in practice to delay repair until physiologic stability was achieved. The definition of 'physiologic stability and delayed repair' is center dependent and timing of repair ranges from days to weeks. There is no evidence that delayed repair results in improved survival. New evidence suggests that timing of repair should be dependent on the severity of the defect and degree of lung hypoplasia. Severity can be defined by multiple factors such as side of defect (right vs. left), size of defect, degree of abdominal content herniation, liver- up vs. liver-down, defect size as determined at the time of repair, and prenatal measurements of lung size or volume",

Physiologic parameters after birth may also predict survival and need for ECMO. The relationship between timing of surgical repair and survival appears to vary by severity of the defect and degree of lung hypoplasia. Those with left liver-down CDH have been shown to benefit from a delay in surgical repair of > 48 hours after birth. Repair prior to 48 hours resulted in an increased need for ECMO without improvement in survival. For those with liver-up CDH, a significant delay in repair may result in increased mortality. A recent study found that neonates with left liver-up CDH had reduced mortality if they were repaired prior to going on ECMO. In a cohort of 87 ECMO eligible left liver-up patients, 60 required ECMO (69%). 20 of 21 (95%) repaired in the first 60 hours after birth and before ECMO survived; whereas only 13 of 20 (65%) who had repair delayed and arrived to ECMO unrepaired survived (p=0.02). Timing of repair should be discussed on a daily basis with the Pediatric Surgeons.",

Brain MRI should be obtained prior to discharge in any patient with a severe neonatal course (prolonged mechanical ventilation or ECMO). MRI findings of delayed maturation, white matter injury (PVL) and white matter volume loss have been reported in this population. Evidence of brain injury on MRI may facilitate obtaining interventional therapies at an earlier age after discharge.\n\nB. Due to the risk of neurocognitive delay, all patients should be referred for follow-up in the High-Risk Infant Follow-Up clinic.\n\nC. Late-onset hearing loss occurs in up to 30% of CDH patients. Newborn hearing screen results are not predictive of which patient will develop sensorineural hearing loss. Predictors include prolonged mechanical ventilation, ECMO, large defect size, and duration of treatment with loop diuretics and exposure to aminoglycosides. All patients should be referred for outpatient audiology exams at the time of discharge with",

ECMO is the use of prolonged extracorporeal circulation and gas exchange via a modified heart-lung machine to provide temporary life support in patients with cardiac and/or respiratory failure who are refractory to maximum ventilatory and medical management. 1 ECMO patients are cared for by a separate service staffed by Drs. Krisa Van Meurs, Bill Rhine, Lou Halamek, Sonia Bonifacio, Valerie Chock, Alexis Davis, Jon Palma, Nicole Yamada, and Shazia Bhombal. You will need to know how to identify potential ECMO candidates, how to ready your patient for ECMO, and how to care for the infant following ECMO.",

Pre-ECMO Procedures\n\nInfants who are being considered for ECMO should receive:\n\nA. **Echocardiogram**: The echocardiogram is to exclude congenital heart disease, look for pulmonary hypertension, and also to check the fractional shortening, which will help decide whether the infant will receive venovenous (VV) or venoarterial (VA) ECMO. VA ECMO provides complete cardio-respiratory support via 2 catheters in the internal jugular vein and carotid artery, while VV ECMO provides respiratory support alone via a single dual lumen catheter in the internal jugular vein.2\n\nB. **Head Ultrasound**: This is done to check for significant intracranial hemorrhage, which could extend with the systemic heparinization. Intracranial hemorrhage is one of the risks associated with ECMO and occurs in 5-10% of ECMO patients.3 It occurs at higher rates in those of lower gestational age and with other risk factors such as asphyxia, acidosis, and coagulation abnormalities. If there is a Grade I or II bleed, ECMO is still feasible, however the ECMO doctors may choose to use less heparin and an antifibrinolytic agent, Amicar®.4\n\nC. **Coagulation Studies**: A PT, PTT, fibrinogen, and platelet count should be sent on patients being considered for ECMO. Any coagulation abnormalities should be corrected prior to ECMO cannulation\n\nD. **ECMO Consent**: The ECMO attending and NICU fellow will take obtain the consent and notify the ECMO team, which includes the Perfusionist, OR Charge Nurse, and Pediatric Surgeon.\n\nE. **Blood Product Ordering**:\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

You will receive a signout from the ECMO doctors. In general, some of the post-ECMO concerns will be:\n\nA. **Respiratory**: In general, patients weaned off ECMO no longer have PPHN physiology. The respiratory care goals will be normal gases with pH 7.35-7.45, PaCO2 40-50, and PaO2 60-80. After the infant has awakened from the vecuronium and fentanyl given for the decannulation procedure, the ventilator can be weaned. Most ECMO patients are extubated within 48-72 hrs after ECMO with the exception of infants with CDH, who may still have PPHN, require longer periods of ventilation post-ECMO, and require more gradual weaning of mechanical ventilation.\n\nB. **Fluids, Electrolytes, and Nutrition**: The fluid and electrolyte requirements on ECMO are different and generally patients require more KCI (4 mEq/kg) and less NaCl (2 mEq/kg). Patients are generally fluid restricted on ECMO and develop some edema while on bypass. The TPN on ECMO has a high dextrose concentration and the patient receives limited lipids. The post-ECMO TPN orders will need to be changed. The total IV fluid rate will depend on the fluid status, but the NaCl should be increased to 3 mEq/kg and the KCL decreased to 2mEq/kg. Electrolytes will need to be checked 2 times daily for 48 hrs. The total glucose given (mg/kg/min) may be kept the same, but the dextrose concentration will decrease as several drips will be discontinued (heparin drip, sedation, and possibly Amicar®). The intralipids can also be advanced once off ECMO.\n\nC. **Hematologic**: ECMO patients receive frequent platelet transfusions while on ECMO to keep their platelet count >80-100K and decrease the risk of bleeding complications. The platelet count and hematocrit should be checked twice daily for 48 hrs. Post ECMO patients should receive a platelet transfusion for platelet count<75,000 in the first 24-48 hours following decannulation\n\nD. **Neurologic**: ECMO patients receive a daily HUS during the first week on bypass; less frequent exams may be done thereafter depending on the individual patient, and are monitored with NIRS and aEEG. No further HUS will be needed after ECMO, but an MRI is ordered when the infant is extubated or prior to return transport. This is done to check for intracranial hemorrhage, cerebral infarct or extra-axial fluid collections.\n\nE. **Follow-up**: ECMO patients are seen in the Developmental and Behavioral Clinic at 4 mos, 12 mos, and 2 yrs to assess neurodevelopmental outcome, respiratory outcomes, and hearing. All infants placed on ECMO should be referred for outpatient audiology evaluation. As a group, ECMO survivors are at increased risk of behavioral and school difficulties, although mean IQ is within the normal range. The rate of major disabilityand mental retardation is comparable to other high-risk populations.5 Please have an appointment scheduled prior",

This pattern is common in preterm infants, maybe due to instability of respiratory\ncontrol center. This is a typical breathing pattern in full-term and pre-term infants during active (rapid eye\nmovement, REM) sleep.\n\nE. **Apnea types**:\n\n1. **Central**: breathing pause without respiratory effort.\n\n2. **Obstructive**: e.g., respiratory effort without effective ventilation and airflow; may be associated with\nmechanical/anatomic abnormality or failure to maintain upper airway muscle tone during inspiration.\n\n3. **Mixed**: Usually a central respiratory pause preceded or followed by airway obstruction.\n\nII. **Differential Diagnosis of Apnea**\n\nA. **Infection**: especially with history of prolonged rupture of membranes, maternal fever, central lines, RSV in the\nolder infant.\n\nB. **Impaired oxygenation**: pallor, shock, L-to-R shunt through PDA, anemia, pulmonary edema, and heart\nfailure.\n\nC. **Metabolic disorders**: hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalance, lactic acidosis.\n\nD. **Drugs**: maternal opiates, anti-convulsants, prostaglandin, magnesium.\n\nE. **Neurologic**: seizures, asphyxia, intracranial hemorrhage, brain malformation, increased intracranial pressure\ndue to hydrocephalus.\n\nF. **Feeding-related**: Association with gastroesophageal reflux \"GER\" in the full-term infant and pre-term infant is\ntenuous and should not be assumed without good supporting evidence such as a pH Probe Study. (See NICU\nGuide Section II.F. \"Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease\".) Dysphagia and aspiration can also cause apnea,\nparticularly in patients with a history of tracheo-esophageal fistula, laryngomalacia, or neurologic dysfunction\n\nG. **Thermal instability**: Both hyper- and hypothermia can cause apnea.\n\nH. **Idiopathic**: apnea of prematurity, respiratory drive instability.\n\nI. **Pulmonary disease**: decreased lung compliance (e.g., RDS, pneumonia), increased work-of-breathing.\n\nJ. **Airway obstruction**: anatomic, malposition of trachea associated with neck flexion, excessive oral secretions.",

Pathogenesis\n\nA. **Chemoreceptor function:** Preterm infants have a biphasic response to hypoxemia, with a transient increase in ventilation followed by a sustained depression of ventilation. Carbon dioxide responsiveness is a predominantly central chemoreceptor activity and is less well-developed the more immature the infant. Hypoxemia and hyperoxia also make the preterm infant less responsive to carbon dioxide.\n\nB. **Respiratory center depression:** The frequency of apnea decreases as the brainstem function improves with increasing post-menstrual age (PMA). Respiratory center activity may be impaired by general CNS depressants and changes in ambient temperature.\n\nC. **Sleep state:** Apnea occurs predominantly during active (REM) sleep and indeterminate (transitional) sleep in both preterm and term infants. This may be due to paradoxical chest wall movements (vagal inhibition of intercostal muscles) and decreased FRC during active sleep.\n\nD. **Obstruction:** Airway obstruction may occur spontaneously with infant-initiated neck flexion or passively (e.g., inappropriately placed face mask).\n\nE. **Reflexes:** Active reflexes caused by stimulation of the posterior pharynx (with a suction catheter) of the eyes (e.g. during bag mask ventilation area oculovagal reflex) can incite apnea.\n\nF. **Pulmonary insufficiency of prematurity:** when pulmonary function is insufficient for metabolic needs of the infant.\n\n### IV. Incidence of Apnea of Prematurity\n\nA. Incidence is inversely related to PMA.\n\nB. Generally begins at 1-2 days of age but can start any time during the hospitalization.\n\nC. Persists for variable length of time. Usually decreases by 37 wks PMA;\n   1. May last longer for infants <28 wks gestation at birth.\n   2. May persist beyond 40 wks PMA, either as mild events during sleep, or with feeds.\n\nD. Abnormal for term or near-term infants, look for identifiable cause.\n\nE. No relationship between apnea of prematurity and later SIDS.\n\n### V. Evaluation of the Apneic Infant\n\nA. **Complete history and physical examination:** assess frequency, duration, and temporal association of apneic events.\n\nB. **Respiratory evaluation:**\n   1. ABG (look for hypoxia, acidosis, hypercarbia)\n   2. CXR (look for pulmonary problem e.g., atelectasis, pulmonary edema or infiltrates)\n\nC. **Infectious disease:**\n   1. CBC with manual differential.",

Head ultrasound (if intracranial hemorrhage or post-hemmorhagic hydocephalus suspected).\n2. MRI (if brain abnormality suspected).\n3. If seizures suspected, obtain an aEEG; consider anticonvulsants, request neurology consult.\n4. Sleep/apnea study (to clarify type of apnea, frequency, duration, and associated events).\n\nF. Cardiac: Consider PDA in preterms.\n\nG. Gastrointestinal: Gastroesophageal Reflux (GER) on a pH probe study is found commonly and may be physiologic in preterm and term infants, but it is usually not the cause for apnea in the preterm infant. An apnea pH study may be helpful to clarify this issue but again this association rarely is found to be the cause for apnea in the preterm infant. The use of histamine blockers does not stop GER, and does have associate risk (e.g., NEC). A Modified Barium Swallow can diagnose dysphagia and aspiration from above. The OT sta will usually assess the patient clinically first, and will participate in the Modified Barium Swallow if deemed indicated. Since both are common in premature infants, and may resolve with maturation, work-up for either GERD or swallow dysfunction should be delayed until the patient is close to maturity (> 37 wk PMA) unless there is a strong indication (e.g., tracheo-esophageal fistula).\n\nH. Hematologic: The association between anemia and apnea is weak and our ability to predict which patient's symptoms will respond to transfusion is poor. Avoid transfusion unless there are other symptoms suggestive of anemia (e.g., tachycardia, poor weight gain).",

Although oxygen can be life-saving, it can also be toxic.\n\n1. Use of 100% oxygen in incubators during the 1940s and 1950s was linked to a very high incidence of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) - as the oxygen concentration was decreased over the 1950's and 1960's, the ROP rate dropped.\n2. Evidence shows that reactive oxygen species, like superoxide, in combination with other factors, can lead to inflammation and damage of tissues and organs including the lung. This may play an important role in the development of chronic lung disease.\n3. Antioxidant defense systems are likely to be decreased and impaired in premature infants, so our patients are at even higher risk for damage due to oxygen toxicity.\n4. A number of studies led to the recognition that an optimal range for oxygen saturation and PaO2 had not been elucidated fully for preterm infants receiving supplemental oxygen. Subsequently, several recent randomized controlled trials have investigated oxygen saturation targets within the AAP recommended ranges.\n\na. Several trials from 1950s to 1970s compared unrestricted oxygen supplementation (FiO2>50%) for 2-7 weeks with more \"restricted\" oxygen supplementation to ≤50% inspired oxygen concentration regardless of the condition of the preterm infants.\n\ni. The practice of \"restricted\" oxygen was NOT associated with an increase in mortality.\nii. A meta-analysis of 5 trials showed that oxygen restriction decreased the incidence and severity of retinopathy without an effect on mortality.\n\nb. A retrospective study reviewing different oxygenation policies in England for infants born less than 28 weeks suggested that keeping target oxygen saturations in the range 70-90% was associated with a lower rate of threshold ROP and shorter duration of time on oxygen and on the ventilator compared with a higher target range. No improvement in survival or rate of cerebral palsy was seen in the higher saturation group.\n\nc. Another retrospective study of 7 United States NICUs reported that in infants 500-1000 g, a policy of accepting lower O2 saturations was associated with LOWER rates of CLD, severe ROP, and ROP requiring surgery. There was no difference in survival rates between groups.\n\nd. A study comparing resuscitation at birth with room air vs. 100% oxygen in term infants followed markers for oxidant stress and antioxidant enzymes at birth, 72 hrs after birth, and 28 days after birth. The infants resuscitated with room air had increased markers for oxidant stress and antioxidant enzymes compared to non-asphyxiated infants at 72 hrs of age. The infants resuscitated with 100% oxygen had significantly higher levels than infants resuscitated with room air. At 28 days of life the markers for the infant resuscitated with room air were the same as for the non-asphyxiated infants, but the infants resuscitated with 100% oxygen still had significantly higher markers for oxidant stress and antioxidant enzymes at 28 days of life.\n\ne.

The SUPPORT trial of the NICHD Neonatal Research Network was a 2x2 factorial, multi-center study designed to compare 2 approaches to early respiratory management (Finer N, NEJM 2010) and 2 ranges of oxygen saturation (85-89% vs. 91-95%) among infants born at 24 to <28 weeks of gestation. The lower oxygenation arm did not significantly decrease the composite outcome of severe ROP or death, but did result in an increase in mortality and a substantial decrease in severe ROP among survivors.\n\nb. The BOOST II trial (UK, Australia, New Zealand) also compared the same 2 oxygen saturation ranges (85-89% vs. 91-95%) among <28 week EGA infants. The lower oxygenation arm was associated with a significantly increased risk for death, and a significantly decreased risk for ROP.\n\nc. The COT trial (Canada, US, Argentina, Finland, Germany, Israel) showed differing results. In extremely preterm infants, targeting oxygen saturations of 85% to 89% compared with 91% to 95% had no significant effect on the rate of death or disability at 18 months.\n\nd. A recent meta-analysis of these major international studies6 reported \"no significant differences in death or disability at 24 months, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy of prematurity, neurodevelopmental outcomes, or hearing loss at 24 months.\"\n\ne. However, one recent paper did seem to show a decrease in severe ROP & laser treatment with increased O2 saturations at PMA ≥ 36 wk.",

The STOP-ROP study investigated the possibility that supplemental oxygen might reduce the progression of prethreshold ROP to threshold ROP. The findings indicated that use of supplemental oxygen did not cause any further progression, but also didn't reduce the need for eye surgery in most patients. One subgroup of patients, those without plus disease treated with supplemental oxygen, had a lower rate of progression to threshold.\n\nB. There is ongoing debate about the best way to treat prethreshold ROP, but supplemental oxygen may be beneficial in a particular subgroup of patients. At Stanford, we currently use supplemental oxygen for some patients with prethreshold disease",

It occurs mainly in infants who are born very prematurely and who require prolonged assisted ventilation to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome (hyaline membrane disease), sustained or recurrent apnea or respiratory failure from sepsis or pneumonia. The condition also develops in some mature infants who are treated with long-term mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure from meconium aspiration, bacterial or viral pneumonia, lung hypoplasia or cardiopulmonary malformations.\n\nB. In 1989, the Bureau of Maternal and Child Health and Resources Development proposed the following diagnostic criteria for BPD:\n\n   1. Requirement for positive pressure ventilation during the first 2 weeks of life. Minimum requirement of ventilation for 3 days.\n   2. Clinical signs of respiratory compromise persisting beyond 28 days of age.\n   3. Requirement for supplemental oxygen beyond 28 days of age in order to maintain a PaO2 of greater than 50 Torr.\n   4. Chest radiographs showing characteristic lung abnormalities (diffuse bilateral densities, often associated with areas of hyperinflation).\n\nC. The definition has been modified to specify a need for supplemental oxygen for greater than 28 days, or extending beyond 36 weeks post-menstrual age [PMA], accompanied by characteristic radiographic abnormalities.\n\nD. An NIH-sponsored workshop on BPD reached a consensus to refer to this disease as BPD instead of CLD to distinguish it from chronic lung diseases seen in later life. A more extensive definition was proposed which uses oxygen dependency at 36 PMA (failure to maintain normal oxygen saturation when breathing room air), and defines mild, moderate, and severe disease. A recent report supported the validity of the more refined definitions of BPD severity according to need for supplemental oxygen and/or positive-pressure breathing at 36 wks PMA. This \"physiologic\" definition of BPD is preferred at LPCH.\n\nE. Most recently, it has been reported that surviving very low gestational age infants may be at risk of impaired lung function in childhood even if they pass the proposed physiologic testing.",

The incidence of BPD is variable between newborn care centers, reflecting not only differences in patient population and infant management practices, but also the different criteria used to define BPD.\n\nB. Recent reports indicate that the incidence of BPD varies from 15-50% in infants whose birth weight is 1500 gm or less and who require assisted ventilation for initial respiratory distress, with most reports showing about a 20-25% incidence of BPD among infants with a birth weight between 500-1500 gm who have received mechanical ventilation.\n\nC. The incidence of BPD is inversely related to gestational age, varying from 80% or more among the most immature infants (less than 24 weeks gestation) to under 5% among infants beyond 32 weeks gestation.",

The initiating event in BPD is considered to be inflammation of the incompletely developed newborn lung. The condition may be associated with chorioamnionitis before birth, systemic infection after birth, or pulmonary accumulation of activated neutrophils, which has been described in hyaline membrane disease, aspiration syndromes, pneumonia, and prolonged application of positive-pressure mechanical ventilation.\n\nB. Deficiency of anti-oxidant enzymes and inhibitors of proteolytic enzymes renders the very immature infant's lungs especially vulnerable to the effects of toxic oxygen metabolites and proteases that are released during inflammation by activated neutrophils and macrophages.\n\nC. **Conditions that are associated with BPD:**\n\n1. Prematurity (especially extreme lung immaturity).\n2. Repetitive stretch and overinflation of the lungs (\"volutrauma\") associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation using large tidal volumes and high inflation pressures.\n3. Oxygen toxicity (related to the magnitude and duration of exposure to supplemental oxygen, and owing to the relative deficiency of antioxidant enzymes in the immature lung).\n4. Development of pulmonary air leaks, notably interstitial emphysema, and pneumothoraces.\n5. Lung edema: excessive fluid and salt intake, persistence of a patent ductus arteriosus, myocardial dysfunction.\n6. Infection and associated inflammation, sometimes with chorioamnionitis before birth, sepsis or pneumonia after birth or acquisition of nosocomial infections.\n7. Conditions that may contribute to acute lung injury and non-uniform lung expansion: aspiration of gastric contents, incorrect placement of the endotracheal tube, improper delivery of surfactant, airway obstruction from mucous plugs.\n8. Other factors: poor nutritional support, genetic predisposition to reactive airways disease, vitamin A deficiency, insufficient adrenal and thyroid hormone release in the very premature infant, gastro-esophageal reflux, and associated aspiration pneumonitis.",

The best approach for preventing or reducing the severity of BPD is to adopt strategies that minimize risk of lung injury and avoid conditions that likely contribute to lung injury.\n\n1.  Antenatal glucocorticoids and postnatal surfactant replacement may not prevent BPD, but they are likely to prevent or reduce the severity of acute lung disease after premature birth and thereby lessen the likelihood of severe chronic lung injury.\n\n2.  Early application of Nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (NCPAP) may help to maintain stability of the immature lung and reduce oxygen requirements, thereby lessening the need for mechanical ventilation and supplemental oxygen.\n\n3.  Treatment with a respiratory stimulant, specifically caffeine, reduces the risk of apnea, and has been shown to reduce the incidence of BPD.\n\n4.  Restricting fluid and salt intake in the first week, so that the infant does not exceed fluid and salt losses (actually allowing for diuresis and a progressive loss of ~15% body weight) has been shown to reduce the risk of BPD.\n\n5.  Assisted ventilation: \"Permissive hypercapnia,\" with use of low peak-inflation pressures (PIP), relatively short inspiratory times, and modest positive end-expiratory pressures (PEEP), allowing PaCO2 to be as high as 55 or 60 cm H2O as long as the pH is 7.25 or greater, appears to be a reasonable approach for managing mechanical ventilation of the premature infant with respiratory failure. As the lungs becomemore compliant, weaning from mechanical ventilation should focus on reducing PIP and tidal volume first to avoid lung over distention, waiting until the PIP is <20 cm H2O and the tidal volume is 4-6 mL/kg before reducing respirator rate. Proper heating and humidification of the inspired gas and caution with endotracheal tube suctioning are important considerations for preventing airway injury. It is noteworthy that despite good rationale for application of \"permissive hypercapnia\" to reduce lung injury in preterm infants (keeping PaCO2 55-65 mmHg during mechanical ventilation in the first wk of life), a randomized trial showed no apparent benefit of this approach for infants between 23-28 wks gestation. Nevertheless, it is still an accepted though debated treatment.",

Early closure of the ductus arteriosus, either by pharmacologic intervention or surgical ligation, was believed to reduce the risk of pulmonary edema and of severe BPD; recent literature has questioned this.\n\n7. Careful and frequent evaluations to detect early signs of infection, meticulous monitoring of aseptic technique in infant handling and in the management of ventilator circuits and airway care, and early initiation of appropriate antimicrobial treatment for infection are critical issues in helping to reduce the incidence and severity of BPD.\n\n8. Although it is important to reduce the inspired oxygen concentration quickly if the oxygen saturation is >96% or PaO2 is >80 mm Hg, it is also important to avoid hypoxemia (O2 saturation <80% or PaO2 <50 mm Hg), which increases pulmonary vascular resistance, fluid filtration lung edema, and airways resistance. Recent studies indicate that either severe hypoxia or severe prolonged hyperoxia may inhibit lung epithelial Na transport and thereby contribute to pulmonary edema. The goal should be to keep the O2 saturation between 90-96% and PaO2 between 50-80 mm Hg. Recent studies have indicated an increased mortality in very low birth weight babies when O2 saturation maintained at < 90%, but a meta- analysis has questioned this. (See NICU Guide Section II.B.11. \"Oxygen Saturation Guidelines\").\n\n9. Other studies have shown that Dopamine, when delivered intravenously at low doses to support systemic blood pressure, can enhance lung epithelial Na transport and thereby facilitate clearance of liquid from the airspaces and resolution of pulmonary edema.",

Fluid and heat losses in the very immature infant (<26 wks gestation) during the first few days after birth can be minimized by keeping the infant in a warm, humidified chamber beneath a radiant warmer.\n2. Fluid balance can be monitored effectively by keeping the infant on a bed scale and measuring body weight at frequent intervals, and by keeping accurate records of fluid intake and urine output.\n3. Frequent measurements of serum electrolytes (every 6 hrs for the very immature infant, every 12 hrs for the infant >26 wks gestation) are important in helping to guide fluid therapy. Sodium is withheld from IV fluids for at least the first 24 hrs and is not added until there is an appropriate diuresis (>2 mL/kg/h) and the weight is at least 5% below birthweight.\n4. In a suitably humidified environment, appropriate initial rates of IV fluid intake for the premature infant are:",

Nutritional needs of the infant with BPD depend on environmental conditions (goal should be a neutral thermal environment), work of breathing, and general metabolism, which may be slightly greater than for infants without BPD.\n1. Early delivery of parenteral nutrition, including protein and lipid, through a peripherally placed central venous line is helpful in establishing early positive nitrogen balance and facilitating growth and lung repair.\n2. Caloric, protein, and mineral needs usually can be met with fortification of mother's breast milk or with premature infant formula with a caloric density of 24-30 kcal/oz.\n3. Premature infants with BPD require nutritional supplements of calcium and phosphorus, in addition to adequate vitamins, and if they are receiving diuretics they also may require additional potassium and chloride.\n\nD. Diuretics: Diuretics must be used with caution because of their potential complications, which include electrolyte deficiencies (notably of sodium, potassium, and chloride), bone demineralization from urinary calcium loss, nephrocalcinosis, and hearing impairment.\n1. Furosemide is a potent diuretic that reduces pulmonary blood flow and lung vascular filtration pressure and thereby decreases interstitial pulmonary edema. The usual dose is 1-2 mg/kg q12h, although every other day treatment also has been shown to improve BPD, perhaps with less likelihood of the aforementioned complications.\n2. Hydrochlorothiazide (1 mg/kg/dose q12h) and spironolactone (1-2 mg/kg/dose q12h) also may be useful, without adverse effects on urinary calcium or hearing loss. The combination (Aldactazide) has to be compounded by the pharmacy, and thus may not be available after discharge for patients who do not live near a Level III/IV NICU. These babies may need to be changed to PO Chlorothiazide 10 mg/kg/dose q12h, likely with PO Potassium Chloride supplements.\n3. Prolonged use of diuretics can cause contraction alkalosis with associated potassium and chloride depletion, usually heralded by a rising serum bicarbonate concentration and a low serum chloride concentration (sometimes in the presence of a low urine pH). Supplemental KCI (2-5 mEq/kg/d divided) or arginine HCI (if serum potassium is high) usually corrects this problem.\n\nE. Retinol (Vitamin A): Vitamin A has been found to decrease the incidence and severity of BPD in extremely premature infants that are deficient in vitamin A. For tiny infants on ventilator support, retinol is given intramuscularly at a dose of 5000 IU 3 times/wk for a total of 12 injections, which is the regimen that was used in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized control/treatment study. Vit A was unavailable due to manufacturing issues between 2010-2014, and the incidence of BPD did not increase, questioning the significance of this treatment, probably due to the marked decrease in Vitamin A deficiency.\n\nF. Glucocorticoids:\n1. Because immature infants often have very low plasma cortisol levels and do not always respond appropriately to corticotropin (ACTH), there is some evidence they may benefit from a short course (10-14 days) of hydrocortisone.\n2. Dexamethasone (Decadron) is not recommended because of its serious side effects: an increased incidence of cerebral palsy and poor neurologic outcome, perhaps related to the discovery of impaired brain growth and periventricular leukomalacia in infants who have received such therapy over a period of several days to weeks.\n3. Inhaled steroids have not been shown to be beneficial in reducing the incidence or severity of BPD.",

ẞ2-adrenergic agonists may be beneficial in BPD by relaxing smooth muscle constriction and also by inducing Na, K-ATPase activity in the lung epithelium, which may improve pulmonary edema.\n\n2. In unusual circumstances, aerosolized bronchodilators, such as albuterol or atrovent, may induce hypoxemia resulting from vasodilation and mismatching of ventilation/perfusion. This may occur if the underlying problem is not bronchoconstriction but rather atelectasis or mucous plugging; hence, close observation of the response to the bronchodilator treatment is very important to determine its effectiveness.\n\n3. Methylxanthines, while helpful in relieving bronchospasm in selected infants with BPD, have significant side effects, including tachycardia, seizures, and gastro-esophageal reflux, which may aggravate BPD. If these drugs are used, plasma levels must be monitored to help establish therapeutic efficacy and prevent toxicity.

Over the first few weeks of life, the tidal volume of ventilated neonates increases from 4-5 mL/kg initially to 6-7 mL/kg.\n2. With the development of BPD, there can be an increase in both airways resistance and compliance resulting in \"multi-compartment lung\" pathophysiology.\n3. To manage this in intubated babies with BPD, we usually recommend a strategy involving higher tidal volumes (>6 mL/kg), longer inspiratory times (0.6-0.8 sec), and slower rates (necessary to avoid \"inverse\" I:E Ratios).\n4. This strategy must be individualized, and should be discussed with the Attending on rounds to guide the transition to, and details of, this ventilator management.\n\nI. **Inhaled Nitric Oxide (iNO):** There is considerable experimental evidence that iNO can improve respiratory gas exchange, reduce lung inflammation, improve alveolarization, and reverse pulmonary hypertension and bronchoconstriction in newborn animals with acute and chronic lung injury.\n1. Recent studies of iNO treatment in animal models of BPD have indicated that this treatment strategy may enhance alveolar development and improve lung function in both premature lambs and baboons with evolving BPD. However, clinical studies do not support the routine use of iNO in premature infants.\n2. Selection of appropriate candidates for iNO treatment, as well as timing and dosing of treatment regimens designed to prevent or reduce the severity of BPD, remain important issues for further research.\n3. Potential toxicities of iNO therapy include oxidant lung injury and loss of surfactant function from the production of peroxynitrite, interference with normal platelet function that could affect the incidence of intracranial or pulmonary hemorrhage, and long-term neurodevelopmental disability. Until more reliable information is available on efficacy and toxicity of iNO for premature infants with evolving BPD, this treatment is experimental and should not be undertaken outside of clinical trials.",

If suspected, an esophageal pH study should be done to test for the presence of reflux and possible apnea in order to establish the severity and frequency of the problem. Whether reflux causes BPD, or is exacerbated by it, is still under investigation.\n\n2. If significant reflux is documented, drugs that might contribute to the problem should be discontinued and anti-reflux medications should be considered.\n\nK. Assessment for vocal cord injury:\n\n1. Stridor or persistent respiratory distress may be a sign of vocal cord injury, which sometimes occurs during cardiovascular surgery, including PDA ligation.\n\n2. This condition can contribute to respiratory symptoms associated with BPD and also prolong weaning from assisted ventilation; thus, vocal cord paralysis should be considered in such situations.",

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a chronic, multisystem, lethal recessive disorder that results from defective epithelial chloride transport with major manifestations in the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and reproductive systems.\n2.  The primary morbidity in CF is from progression of obstructive lung disease. A very large percentage of patients with CF have pancreatic insufficiency, which manifests as malabsorption, and insulin deficiency. Male infertility results from congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens or eventual obstruction and scarring of the vas deferens. Other less common problems encountered include cirrhosis of the liver, cholelithiasis, recurrent pancreatitis, gastroesophageal reflux, and gastrointestinal hypomotility.\n3.  The prognosis used to be quite grave and most infants and children did not survive past the age of 5 yrs. Due to the advent of supplemental enzymes to aid in food digestion and absorption, refined methods of chest physiotherapy, and antibiotics, the median survival age for individuals with CF in the U.S. is approximately 36 yrs. There is a wide variability in the severity of symptoms and the rate of decline in pulmonary function. Many patients now are living into their 40s and 50s. It is difficult to predict the life expectancy of a child born in 2017 because of the time delay of the impact of changes in therapy on life expectancy.",

CF is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, and both parents are usually asymptomatic carriers of the abnormal mutation. It is the most common lethal genetic disease affecting Caucasians, with an incidence of approximately 1 in 2,700 live births with a corresponding carrier frequency of 1 in 32. In the Mexican-American population, the incidence is approximately 1 in 4,500 live births. CF occurs in people of African descent, with the incidence in African-Americans at approximately 1 in 17,000 live births. The disease is extremely rare in persons of native African and of Asian descent.\n\nB. The gene that encodes for the chloride channel affected in CF is located on chromosome 7. Over 2,000 mutations have been identified to date. The gene encodes a protein of 1,480 amino acids called the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR). The most common mutation found in persons of Anglo-Saxon descent is the ΔF508 mutation, and is found in approximately 75% of patients with CF. The Δ F508 mutation is a 3 base pair deletion that results in deletion of a phenylalanine at position 508 of the protein sequence. There is a correlation between genotype and pancreatic status, but there is no correlation of specific mutations with pulmonary phenotype. Some of the CFTR mutations are associated with more severe disease expression than others, and ΔF508 is one of the mutations most commonly associated with the \"severe\" phenotype. Conversely, patients with mutations correlated with normal pancreatic function tend to have a \"milder\" CF phenotype.",

CF involves several organ systems, including the lungs, pancreas, intestines, hepatobiliary tract, genitourinary tract, and sweat duct. The common physiologic feature of these organs is CFTR-mediated ion transport. The exact pathophysiologic mechanism where altered ion and water transport across the epithelia of these organs is not fully described and our understanding of how CFTR dysfunction leads to organ dysfunction is a matter of much debate, but certain theories persist.\n\nB. The CF defect is characterized by a reduced ability of epithelial cells in the airways and pancreas to secrete chloride. CFTR also has a negative regulatory effect on the sodium absorption across the airway epithelium. Thus, enhanced absorption of sodium from the airway lumen and little chloride secretion into the airway leads to decreased fluid presence in the airway. This is thought to lead to relatively dehydrated respiratory (and",

The earliest evidence of airway obstruction occurs at the level of the bronchioles with mucus plugging and inflammation consistent with bronchiolitis. Mucus plugging and inflammation extend from the bronchioles and progressively affect the larger airways over time. The pathologic features of airway abnormalities in CF include inflammatory cell infiltration of the airways, goblet cell hyperplasia, and submucosal gland hypertrophy. The CF airway is also predisposed to bacterial colonization. Chronic infection and inflammation of the airways leads to bronchiectasis and peribronchial fibrosis.",

Another classic pathologic feature of the CF airway is the infiltration of inflammatory cells into the airways, even in early lung disease and in patients who are not yet colonized by bacteria. Neutrophils obtained from the respiratory secretions of CF patients of all ages are deficient in glutathione (GSH). GSH is a peptide that plays a crucial role in maintaining a balance of cellular mechanisms that regulate the oxidative effects of the inflammatory response. Neutrophil elastase appears to be a major player in the pathogenesis of cystic and bronchiectatic changes by way of constant damage to the bronchiolar and bronchial mucosa and airway structural proteins.",

The gold-standard test to diagnose CF is the \"sweat test\" or the pilocarpine iontophoresis test. The sweat glands of CF patients are less able to reabsorb chloride from sweat than normal people are. This leads to a very high level of chloride in the sweat and a reliable method of diagnosis. Premature infants have not developed mature sweat glands, but usually by the time a term infant is 3 wks of age, the test will be successful.\n\na. The possibility of a false positive sweat test exists. The causes include: adrenal insufficiency, ectodermal dysplasia, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, type I glycogen storage disease, anorexia nervosa, hypoparathyroidism, familial cholestatic syndromes, malnutrition and hypoalbuminemia, hypothyroidism, mucopolysaccharidoses, and fucosidosis.\n\n2. Newborn Screening for Cystic Fibrosis\n\na. Screening for cystic fibrosis at the time of birth has led to early identification of CF with a resultant positive impact on the nutritional status of young children with CF.\n\nb. Beginning in August 2007, the California legislature mandated the addition of testing for cystic fibrosis with measurement of serum immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) to the newborn screening panel.\n\ni. 4-step screening algorithm:\n\na) Serum IRT measuring \\u2265 the upper 2.2% of IRT measured on that day in newborn infants.",

This is a surgical emergency and may result in intestinal perforation. In the instance of intestinal perforation, an ileostomy and ileal resection are often necessary.\n\nB. **The most common clinical manifestation for infants with CF is respiratory.** Infants frequently present with recurrent episodes of wheezing and respiratory distress (bronchiolitis) and pneumonia. Interestingly, the RUL is the most commonly affected lobe initially. Infants and children may also suffer from atelectasis or pneumothorax and respiratory failure can easily occur in infants with severe inflammation and infection.\n\nC. **The pathophysiology for most of the other organs affected in CF is similar to that of the lungs.** Therefore, in most patients born with CF, the pancreas is severely affected. At the time of birth, the pancreatic ducts are obstructed with inspissated secretions. The ducts and acini are dilated and eventually form cystic changes. Fibrosis ensues as the organ slowly proceeds to autolyse over time. This results in decreased secretion of digestive enzymes into the intestine, and contributes to malabsorption and steatorrhea, classic signs of pancreatic dysfunction. At a critical point, the pancreas is sufficiently damaged such that the CF patient becomes deficient in insulin production and glucose intolerance and diabetes ensue.",

The management of CF can be very complicated due to multi-system involvement and a high frequency of complications. For these reasons, a comprehensive and intensive therapy program is essential. Outpatients are seen at intervals of 2-3 mos by a physician experienced in CF and its manifestations. The CF \"Team\" approach is most beneficial for the patients, and includes Nursing, Nutrition, Physical therapy, Respiratory Therapy, and Social work.\n\nB. Pulmonary Treatment of CF begins early and occurs on a daily basis. While newborn infants with CF may appear asymptomatic from a respiratory standpoint, inflammatory processes are initiated immediately upon delivery. The primary goal is to focus on clearance of excess mucus from the tracheobronchial tree. Initial treatment should include inhalation of a β2-agonist followed by manual percussion and postural drainage. Infants born with meconium ileus are known to develop more severe obstruction earlier in life than CF patients who do not have meconium ileus at birth. Thus, these infants with a more \"severe\" presentation would benefit from a more aggressive pulmonary toilet regimen to include the use of anti-inflammatory treatment, though there is no strict protocol for treatment. Patients and families should be educated on the importance of daily assisted mucus clearance.\n\nC. Antibiotics\n\n1. Treatment is generally reserved for acute exacerbations. When possible, antibiotic therapy is guided by the patient's most recent sputum or throat culture. Long- term data obtained from throat cultures of younger children demonstrate that most tend to be colonized with Staphylococcus aureus and/or Hemophilus influenza. As children become older, Pseudomonas aeruginosa throat colonization becomes more prominent, and growth of S. aureus and H. influenza tend to resolve by the teen yrs.\n\n2. If a patient requires hospitalization for CF pneumonia, when treating a gram-negative, lactose non-fermenting bacillus such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, double antibiotic therapy is utilized in order to achieve a synergistic bactericidal effect. The most common antibiotic regimens utilize an aminoglycoside such as tobramycin combined with a third-generation semisynthetic penicillin or a cephalosporin that has adequate anti-pseudomonal activity (ceftazidime or cefepime).\n\n3. CF patients require very high doses of most medications to achieve therapeutic serum levels. Aminoglycosides bind covalently to the DNA that is abundant in the CF airway, and the volume of distribution of the drug is increased. In particular, in the absence of renal dysfunction, aminoglycoside",

GI symptoms are typical for patients with CF, but treatment with oral pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy is often all that is needed to improve and maintain adequate nutritional status and minimize malabsorption, steatorrhea, constipation, and diarrhea.\n\n2. Pancreatic enzymes are obtained primarily from porcine pancreas and available in powder or capsule form. The amount of enzyme dosage per capsule varies. The dose of enzyme given is based on the patient's weight, and most patients are maintained on doses of 500-5000 lipase units/kg/meal. The capsules contain small microencapsulated enzymes, which are protected from acid digestion in the stomach, and are most active in the duodenum and ileum, where the pH is alkaline. Since the patients who require enzyme replacement therapy are, by definition, pancreatic insufficient, they may require concomitant doses of antacid to maximize the activity of the pancreatic enzyme in the small intestine.\n\n2. For infants, the capsule is opened, and the tiny beads are either poured directly into the infants mouth, or the beads or placed in the tip of a nipple and \"dissolved\" in a tiny bit of formula. Enzymes are administered orally immediately before each meal. The infant first takes this, then is given the bottle of formula or breast-fed. Sometimes, the powdered form is added to the formula, but this leads to immediate curdling of the formula and seems to make the formula taste bad. Many infants reject this.",

In the newborn, the most frequent and serious complication is that of meconium ileus with intestinal perforation.\n\nB. Older children and adults can suffer other types of complications that are a result of the scarring and fibrosis that occurs in the lungs, liver, and pancreas.\n\n1. **Hemoptysis**: Patients often experience blood streaking of their sputum. This is probably due to rupture of surface capillaries secondary to vigorous coughing. A larger danger exists if bleeding occurs due to erosion of bronchial arteries into a bronchus. This most often occurs in association with a pulmonary exacerbation. It occurs in <10% of adults and rarely in children and it is estimated that 1% of all patients die from massive hemoptysis.\n2. **Pneumothorax** occurs in 8-23% of older CF patients but can occur in children with severe disease. The mortality rate is about 4% if pneumothorax occurs and the median survival after pneumothorax occurs is",

One of the disadvantages is that that amount of medication delivered to the patient is estimated to be 10%. Particle size may vary depending on the type of nebulizer used. Treatment time can last up to 20 min. Patients on mechanical ventilation may require adjustments in their ventilator settings during the treatment.\n2.  **Ordering:** by milligram or strength of solution (e.g., Albuterol 2.5 mg every 4 hrs).\n\nB. **Metered Dose Inhalers (MDI):**\n\n1.  **Use:** MDIs are given to neonates using mask and spacer or in-line for ventilated patients. The advantages are portability, efficient drug delivery, and short preparation time. For ventilated patients, ventilator settings do not have to be altered during treatment delivery. The disadvantages are fixed drug concentrations, limited choice of drugs, possible reaction to the propellants, and oropharyngeal deposition.\n2.  **Ordering:** These medications are ordered by the \"puff.\" For ventilated patients the dose should be increased, as medication impacts on the endotracheal tube (ETT).",

Anticholinergics (parasympatholytic) Bronchodilators\n\nThe potential for bronchodilation by parasympatholytic agents is based on the premise that the parasympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system maintains a basal tone in bronchial smooth muscle and possibly exerts an abnormally active role in hyper-reactive airway diseases such as asthma. To the extent that the parasympathetic branch causes airway constriction in disease, agents that block parasympathetic receptors will prevent bronchoconstriction.\n\n1. Ipratropium Bromide (Atrovent®):\n\ta. Use: Ipratropium bromide is an anticholinergic agent that has a local, site-specific effect, not a systemic one. It is indicated for the treatment of the bronchospastic symptoms. It is often used in conjunction with other bronchodilators, especially beta adrenergics, and prevents bronchoconstriction. Ipratropium bromide has been demonstrated to exert its effects primarily on the more central airways. It may be useful for decreasing secretion in the central airways.\n\ti. How supplied:\n\t\ta) Ipratropium MDI: CFC free 17 mcg/inh\n\n\t\tDose: The pediatric (<12 yrs old) dose is 2 puffs given every 4-6 hrs, the total 24-hr dose should not exceed 12 puffs or 0.24 mg. Insufficient clinical data exist with respect to dosage for patients <12 yrs old.\n\n\t\tb) Ipratropium bromide 0.02% solution: 500 mcg in 2.5 ml normal saline unit dose\n\n\t\tDose: The adult dose is 500 mcg (1 unit dose vial) administered 3-4 times per day by oral nebulization, with doses 6-8 hrs apart. Safety, efficacy, and dose in children <12 yrs has not been established. Various dosages have been described in the literature.",

Use: Sympathomimetic bronchodilators act by stimulating the beta-2 receptors of the sympathetic nervous system to increase the concentration of cyclic AMP, causing bronchial smooth muscle relaxation. These agents are indicated for patients with lung disease who have a reversible airway obstruction. Since these agents can also increase both cardiac contraction and rate, the patient's HR must be monitored before, during, and after these agents are given. Children who do not have heart disease may be treated with bronchodilators at HR up to 200 bpm. In children with heart disease or HR bpm >200 bpm, use with caution. All orders must include pulse range restrictions. Generally, doses should be adjusted to patient response, and administered when patient is symptomatic. Albuterol does not prevent bronchospasm; it reverses it. An alternative is to use levalbuterol, which is the L-isomer of albuterol.",

Corticosteroids\n\nThe primary purposes of inhaled corticosteroids are to treat asthma through the anti-inflammatory effect and to reduce tracheal inflammation. Inhaled corticosteroids have greater effect topically and less effect systemically. Controlled clinical studies have shown that orally inhaled and intranasal corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity in pediatric patients. In studies of orally-inhaled corticosteroids, the mean reduction in growth velocity was approximately 1 cm/yr (range 0.3-1.8 cm/yr) and appears to be related to dose and duration of exposure. To minimize the systemic effects of orally inhaled and intranasal corticosteroids, each patient should be titrated to the lowest effective dose.",

These poly-cationic regions interact with the bacterial outer membrane, by displacing bacterial counter ions in the lipopolysaccharide. Hydrophobic/hydrophillic regions interact with the cytoplasmic membrane just like a detergent, solubilizing the membrane in an aqueous environment. This effect is bactericidal even in an isosmolaric environment. It is used primarily for patients with cystic fibrosis, but can be used effectively and with a minimum of systemic absorption to avoid renal toxicity for patients with tracheostomies who have symptoms of tracheitis or bronchitis due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa or generally other other gram-negative species resistant to tobramycin and other antibiotics.",

Patients with low cardiac output or congestive heart failure may have peripheral vasoconstriction caused by increased circulating catecholamines.\n2. Neonates with left heart obstructive lesions become symtomatic when the PDA begins to close. Once this occurs, there is decreased systemic perfusion that leads to the development of metabolic acidosis, which further compromises cardiac function.\n3. Infants with low cardiac output usually have weak pulses; however, those with systemic artery-to-pulmonary artery connections may have bounding pulses despite decreased systemic blood flow. Those infants with weak pulses or absent pulses in the lower extremities may have an interrupted aortic arch or coarctation.\n\nD. **Liver**:\nUsually found at 1-2 fingers width below the right costal margin.

Unusual features possibly related to a genetic syndrome should prompt a Genetics consult and chromosome analysis. See Appendix A: Genetic Testing Algorithm for Complex CHD Patients.\n2. If the heart lesion is a conotruncal heart malformation (e.g., truncus arteriosus, Tetralogy of Fallot, interrupted aortic arch type B, conoventricular septal defects), a microdeletion of chromosome 22, otherwise known as DiGeorge syndrome or velocardiofacial syndrome (VCF), may be present. FISH for 22q11 deletion should be ordered as part of the chromosomal work up. If 22q11 deletion is diagnosed, further endocrine/immunologic work-up is indicated (See NICU Guide Section II.J. \"[22q11 Deletion Syndrome](https://example.com/22q11_Deletion_Syndrome)\").\n3.

Elevated pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary arterial pressure in conjunction with pulmonary vasoreactivity characterize PPHN. This produces right-to-left shunting at the PDA and PFO. It results in hypoxemia from extra-pulmonary shunting which can be poorly responsive to medical management. PPHN is felt to represent failure of the pulmonary circulation to adapt to post-natal conditions and as such is sometimes called “persistent fetal circulation”. The pulmonary vascular bed is abnormal with extension of the medial smooth muscle layer into the smaller and more peripheral intraacinar vessels.\n\n<a id='064f59ea-1c25-4946-9422-fe55ff818ef9'></a>\n\nII. **PPHN Occurs in Several Settings**\n\nA. **Idiopathic:** Idiopathic PPHN occurs when there is abnormally constricted pulmonary vasculature without parenchymal lung disease. Clinical presentation is hypoxemia that is out of proportion to the degree of parenchymal lung disease. It has been called \"black-lung\" PPHN, due to the lack of pulmonary vascular markings on chest radiograph.\n\nB. **Parenchymal lung disease:** PPHN frequently accompanies meconium aspiration syndrome, respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis and/or pneumonia. In these settings, evidence of PPHN is seen in addition to intra-pulmonary shunting from parenchymal lung disease.\n\nC. **Lung hypoplasia:** Lung hypoplasia can be seen with congenital diaphragmatic hernia and in infants with premature prolonged rupture of the membranes and longstanding oligohydramnios. In these conditions, lung growth and development are affected and there is a variable degree of lung hypoplasia. This results in a decrease in the cross-sectional area of the pulmonary vascular bed, with subsequent pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary vasoconstriction.\n\nD. **Rare, fatal conditions:** Respiratory failure and PPHN can be the presenting features in Surfactant Protein B (SPB) deficiency, alveolar capillary dysplasia (ACD), and lymphangiectasia.\n\n<a id='14e58d73-8961-4a57-b70e-9fb5dcf9e6a6'></a>\n\n### III. Treatment\n\nA. **Identify infants** at risk for PPHN: Infants with meconium in the amniotic fluid should be monitored with pulse oximetry following birth. Infants at risk for PPHN should be monitored for signs of respiratory distress and desaturation. UAC placement should be considered in infants at risk of PPHN who have respiratory distress. Differential pre/post-ductal saturations reflect shunting at the ductal level. Hypoxemia in PPHN is typically labile and not fixed as it is in cyanotic congenital heart disease. ECHO is the best method to evaluate for PPHN and rule-out congenital heart disease.\n\nB. Promptly treat hypoxemia and acidosis: Hypoxemia and acidosis increase pulmonary vascular resistance and should be promptly addressed.\n\nC. Assure adequate cardiac output by maintaining a mean arterial pressure >45 in a term or near-term infant. This may be achieved with a combination of either volume boluses or pressors. Dopamine is the first line drug. ECHO can evaluate right and left heart function and guide management of blood pressure. Central arterial and venous pressure monitoring is desirable to guide therapy.\n\nD. Maintain adequate oxygen carrying capacity by keeping the hematocrit between 40 and 50. Hematocrits in\n\n<a id='21eb4d0f-e222-439c-a126-e75171347b0e'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Intubation and mechanical ventilation for infants with continued instability of oxygenation: Both hypo and hyperinflation may increase PVR. Gentle ventilation strategies should be used to minimize iatrogenic lung injury. Goal lung expansion is 8-9 ribs.\n\nF. If there is evidence of pulmonary hypertension clinically or on ECHO, the suggested target ABGs are: pH 7.35-7.45, PaCO2 35-50 and PaO2 60-80. PaCO2 values under 35 will decrease cerebral blood flow and increase the risk for brain injury. Hyperventilation and alkalinization may negatively impact cerebral perfusion and increase the risk of sensorineural hearing loss. Avoid using 100% oxygen, goal preductal saturation is > 92 - 95%. In certain patients such as those with CDH, post-ductal saturations in the 70s – 80s may be tolerated if serum lactate is < 3 and there is adequate urine output. Consider use of NIRS in this patient population to monitor for cerebral vasoconstriction. High frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) may be considered to achieve the above blood gas targets.\n\nG. Minimize stress by reducing unnecessary handling and noise.\n\nH. Assure appropriate sedation and analgesia. The drugs of choice are morphine and versed given as continuous infusions. Neuromuscular blockade should be considered if oxygenation remains problematic after other therapeutic approaches have been used.\n\nI.

Maximal Medical Therapy Alternatives\n\nA. **High frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV)**: HFOV should be considered when PIP is > 25-28 or tidal volume of more than 6ml/kg is needed to maintain CO2 < 60 or if OI >10.\n\nB. **Surfactant therapy**: Surfactant should be considered in patients with parenchymal lung disease and when OI ≥15. Infants with lung injury and respiratory failure may have a secondary surfactant deficiency. A masked randomized trial reported a significant reduction in the need for ECMO with surfactant therapy. Subgroup analysis showed the greatest benefit in the group with OI 15-22. Consider using a test dose in unstable infants.\n\nC. **Inhaled nitric oxide therapy (iNO)**: See section V\n\nD. **ECMO**: See NICU Guide Section II:B\n\nE. **Milrinone**: Milrinone increases cardiac output and lowers systemic vascular resistance as well as pulmonary vascular resistance. It can be used in PPHN when blood pressure is normal and there is good cardiac function. In neonates with low blood pressure and poor cardiac function milrinone can be used in conjunction with other vasoactive agents.\n\n<a id='7df4a75b-a3ad-408f-9820-336636a88bb2'></a>\n\nV. Inhaled Nitric Oxide\n\nA. Background\n\n1. Nitric oxide is a regulator of vascular tone, endogenously produced by the vascular endothelium. Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) therapy causes selective pulmonary vasodilation in animal models and humans. Multicenter randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that iNO significantly improves oxygenation and reduces the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in term and near-term infants with hypoxic respiratory failure and persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). iNO is FDA\n\n<a id='b05bd8cd-6100-4c15-8055-9850cb09b4f2'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Indications\n\n1. Gestational age ≥34 wks.\n2. Mechanical ventilation with an Ol ≥25 on 2 ABGs at least 15 min apart. Use of iNO with Ol ≥25 has been shown to decrease ECMO/death.\n3. There is some recent literature suggesting that iNO initiation with an Ol ≥ 15-25 results in decreased progression to Ol >30 (P=0.002) and a 41% reduction in the rate of ECMO or death. The effect on ECMO/death was not statistically significant, but may be clinically important.\n4. Attending physician approval.\n\n<a id='d5674e0f-9529-4cd1-a565-3ddd51af5448'></a>\n\nC. Administration, Dosing, and Weaning Strategies for iNO in the Term Infant\n\n1.  Nitric Oxide Dosing Strategy - Refer to algorithm (see figure).\n2.  Acute Deterioration During Initial Dosing - If the patient experiences a significant deterioration during initial dosing requiring a change in vent settings or performance of a procedure (e.g., chest tube placement), iNO use should be discontinued and initial dosing repeated once the patient has stabilized.\n3.  Exit Criteria\n    a. NO2 levels >5 ppm.\n    b. Methemoglobin levels >10%.\n    c. Deterioration in patient's condition felt to be related to iNO therapy.\n4.  Toxicity - Toxicity related to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) formation and methemoglobinemia (metHb) is rare but important side effects of iNO use. NO2 formation occurs when NO and oxygen are combined in the ventilator circuit. NO2 is measured by the iNOvent continuously. Methemoglobinemia occurs when there is a deficiency or relative deficiency of the enzyme methemoglobin reductase or if high doses of iNO are administered.\n    a. If NO2 ≥3 ppm, wean by 50% (if ≤5 ppm iNO then decrease by 1 ppm) every 15 min until NO2 <3 ppm.\n    b. If NO2 levels >5 ppm, discontinue iNO therapy. If metHb ≥5%, wean by 50% (if ≤5 ppm iNO decrease by 1 ppm) every 15 min until MetHb <5%.\n    c. If metHb levels >10%, discontinue iNO therapy.\n\n<a id='8be962fd-e6bf-405c-994a-c91ba5edab7f'></a>\n\nD. Weaning\n\n1. Baseline refers to pre-wean ABG drawn <15 min before change.\n2. First wean performed 6 ±2 hrs following initiation.\n3. Subsequent weans every 4 ±2 hrs if Ol ≤10 or every 6 ±2 hrs if Ol >10.\n\n<a id='0fa0e9d3-06ab-43cc-942e-0e44a955b166'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Nitric oxide is weaned as follows: 20 → 10 → 5 → 4 → 3 → 2 → 1 → 0 ppm\n5. ABG timing: baseline before wean, then 30 min after. No vent/FiO2 changes during wean attempt.\n6. If pre-wean PaO2 ≥100, wean successful if PaO2 falls by ≤35% and PaO2 >60.\n7. If pre-wean PaO2 <100, wean successful if PaO2 falls by ≤20% and PaO2 >60.\n8. If pre-wean PaO2 <60, wean successful if decrease in PaO2 ≤10% from baseline.\n\n<a id='6c3df2b5-037b-41fd-ab81-b23138d683d4'></a>\n\nE. Escalation\n\n1. Recommended maximum iNO dose is 20 ppm.\n2. Deterioration in oxygenation is defined as PaO2 < 50 and/or decrease in PaO2 >10% from last successful post-wean ABG. iNO dose should be doubled and ABG obtained in 30 min (if <5 ppm, increase to 5 ppm).\n3. Escalation continues until a full response (>20 Torr) is achieved.\n4. If only a partial response (10-20 Torr), then return to the lowest iNO dose that resulted in a partial response.\n5. If less than a partial response is achieved, then return to pre-escalation iNO dose.\n\n<a id='28afab28-da17-4a6e-bf21-ff42b61696d3'></a>\n\nF. Re-Initiation\n\n1. Recommended cumulative iNO administration is 336 hrs (14 days).\n2. Reinitiation is possible if patient meets original eligibility requirements again, after a successful wean off.\n3. iNO is restarted at 1 ppm (ABG after 30 min) looking for a full response.\n4. If there is not a full response, then return to the iNO initiation flow algorithm using the pre-initiation ABG as baseline ABG.\n\n<a id='48bbcf81-52fa-4f5d-a9b5-23da8ad80ea3'></a>\n\nG.

Other Uses of iNO Therapy\n\n1.  **Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH)**: Prospective randomized controlled trials of iNO for CDH have failed to show reduced need for ECMO or reduced mortality. iNO is, nonetheless, used in CDH patients with refractory hypoxemia prior to ECMO as a rescue therapy. It has been shown to be helpful in the CDH patients post-repair. In addition, some CDH patients have prolonged pulmonary hypertension despite improvements in respiratory support requirements. These patients may benefit from long-term, low-dose nitric oxide, which may even be delivered by nasal cannula if mechanical ventilation is no longer required. Serial echocardiograms, assessing changes in pulmonary hypertension, should be used to assist in the management of these complex patients.\n\n2.  **Cardiac indications**: iNO has been used for pulmonary hypertension related to cardiac anomalies, particularly in the post-operative phase. Few published data exist regarding outcome, although iNO has been reported to reduce pulmonary artery pressure and possibly reduce the need for ECMO.\n\n3.  **iNO for preterm infants**: Trials in premature infants have been categorized as follows: Early rescue (use in critically ill premature infant unresponsive to surfactant), early prophylactic use (routine use in intubated premature infants), and later use for BPD prevention (use in infants remaining intubated after a week of life).\n\n    a.  Early Rescue use: There were several trials in critically ill infants after birth and the Cochrane meta-analysis showed no benefit on BPD or death. 5 The NICHD Preemie iNO trial6 was the largest in this category and results are as follows:\n\n        i.  No benefit to survival or in reduction of rate of physiologic BPD in infants with severe RDS.\n\n        ii. Subgroup analysis suggested that infants >1000 gm may benefit in terms of the outcome of death or BPD however infants ≤1000 g had higher mortality and increased rates of severe IVH.\n\n        iii. However, neurodevelopment follow-up from this trial showed no benefit from iNO exposure on death, neurodevelopmental impairment or neurodevelopmental outcomes in early childhood among the severely ill premature infants in this trial. An increased risk of death or moderate-sever cerebral palsy (CP) moderate-severe CP was seen among survivors given iNO.\n\n    b.  Early prophylactic use: Three large trials were completed in this subgroup. A single center study by Schreiber showed a significant reduction in BPD and death; however, this was not reproduced in two subsequent large trials.\n\n    c.  Later use for BPD prevention: One large RCT enrolled newborns between 7 and 21 days of life if they remained intubated or on CPAP and treated them for a minimum of 24 days with iNO. Results found improved survival without BPD. An industry sponsored study was performed to confirm these results and no benefit was seen. This study has not yet been published, but the results were presented at Hot Topics in 2013. Of interest, sub-group analysis found evidence of benefit in black population which has biologic plausibility due to differences in bioavailability of NO in persons who self-identify as black.\n\n    d.  An individual patient data meta-analysis, NIH Consensus Conference statement and AAP Committee on Fetus and Newborn do NOT recommend iNO for routine use in premature infants. iNO has not been consistently shown to be effective in reducing rates of BPD or death.\n\n    e.  Of note, the NIH Consensus Conference statement recognized that there are specific clinical situations, and subgroup and post-hoc study findings that point to a potential iNO benefit among preterm infants. One such group is premature infants with PPROM. oligohydramnios, pulmonary hypoplasia and likely pulmonary hypertension. Several case studies have suggested benefit and a sub-group analysis from the NICHD Preemie iNO trial showed positive effects on oxygenation, BPD\n\n<a id='4b46cff8-eebd-4909-b9a1-8288b9b9a044'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Infants with Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH) who have respiratory distress from birth often have significant mortality despite aggressive medical intervention.\n\nB. The past approach to the patient with CDH utilized hyperventilation, alkalinization, and high mean airway pressures to treat the pulmonary hypoplasia and Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension of the Newborn (PPHN) associated with CDH. These therapies can result in barotrauma and air leak, and may cause iatrogenic lung injury resulting in a higher need for ECMO and lower survival.\n\nC. Severity of CDH can be estimated using antenatal US and MRI. Lung-to-Head Ratio (LHR) and Observed- to- Expected (O/E) LHR are strong predictors of outcome. LHR is determined by the area of the contralateral lung at the level of the four-chamber view of the heart compared to head circumference. LHR is influenced by\n\nGestational age (GA) and is most predictive at 24-34 weeks. An LHR < 1 carries a poor prognosis and cases can be referred for fetal intervention, an LHR of 1-1.4 carries a high risk of ECMO, and an LHR >1.4 carries the best prognosis. Calculation of the O/E LHR incorporates the expected lung volume for GA and thus can be helpful in prognosis regardless of GA at the time of measurement. O/E LHR < 25% is associated with survival rate of < 25%, an O/E LHR of 26-45% is considered moderate risk with survival between 30-60% dependent on liver position, and an O/E LHR > 45% is considered mild. Liver position is an important predictor of outcome with herniation 'up' into the thorax correlating with worse prognosis\n\n<a id='61991d27-9771-4e00-bcab-7e8dbdb8e0cc'></a>\n\n## **II. Current Management of Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia**\n\nSince first suggested by Wung, et al, many centers have used \"gentle” ventilation strategies with permissive hypercapnia for critically ill CDH infants. This group reported on the use of this approach in 120 infants with severe CDH; the overall survival was 75.8%, with ECMO needed in only 13.3%. The goal is to avoid lung injury, maintain pre-ductal oxygen saturation >85%, and tolerate moderate hypercapnia as long as the pH is >7.20. Protocolized care for CDH has been shown to improve both morbidity and mortality, as was demonstrated in a publication on a standardized management guideline for CDH by a group of European investigators. The following guidelines have been developed from our own practices and outcomes over the last 25 years as well as from a review of the literature.\n\n<a id='5985efbd-bda0-4dd7-bbf7-4087811cdc4b'></a>\n\n### III. Delivery Room Management\n\nA. Intubate immediately. Initiate resuscitation with FiO2 of 50%; ventilate with a PIP 20-24, PEEP 3-5, Rate 40-80; may require a rate as high as 100, especially if chest wall excursion is poor. Goal pre-ductal saturations during resuscitation: 80-95% but may tolerate > 70% for 1 hour post-birth to avoid using high pressures.\nB. Avoid bag mask ventilation to minimize air entry and dilation of intra-thoracic bowel.\nC. Place OG/replogle tube.\nD. Transfer to NICU once stablilized in the DR.\n\n<a id='300d44d9-8322-4e84-bb34-d0e0e2523f28'></a>\n\nIV. **Initial NICU Management**\n\nA. Place pre-ductal saturation monitor.\n\n1.

Place UAC or right radial arterial line and UVC or double lumen PICC.\nC. Place Replogle tube to suction.\nD. Obtain CXR to help guide respiratory management.\nE. Respiratory Management\n    1. Conventional Ventilation (PC/SIMV) should be used before HFOV. Initial management with conventional ventilation may reduce ventilation days and need for ECMO, although has not been shown to impact mortality and/or BPD.\n    2. **Blood Gas Goals: pH >7.20, PaCO2 50-70, PaO2 >30; Lactic acid < 3.**\n    3. Ventilate with **lowest PIP** (usually 20-24 mmHg) to provide adequate BS, PEEP of 3-5 mmHg, with rate 40-80 and FiO2 starting at 50%. Titrate FiO2 using pre-ductal saturation monitor.\n    4. Surfactant should not be routinely used in term or preterm neonates with CDH. In preterm neonates, there was a trend towards increased mortality in those treated with surfactant.\nF. High frequency oscillatory ventilation should be considered in infants who fail conventional ventilation.\n    1. Failure of conventional ventilation = inability to control CO2 with a max PIP of 25 and rate of 60 or inability to maintain oxygenation with PIP of 25 and PEEP of 5.\n    2. Initial Paw should be 2 above that on conventional ventilation but not > 15; Amplitude may be 2x Paw or greater in order to achieve adequate wiggle; Frequency 8-10 Hz; Goal expansion of non-hypoplastic lung of 8-9 ribs.\nG. Blood Pressure Management\nGoal is to maintain the arterial blood pressure at normal level for gestational age and appropriate end organ perfusion.\n    1. NS bolus of 10-20 ml/kg for hypotension or poor perfusion. May be repeated x1 prior to starting inotropic agent. Do not administer more than 40ml/kg of crystalloid.\n    2. Initiate Dopamine at 3 mcg/kg/min following crystalloid boluses. Titrate Dopamine to keep MAP at or above gestational age in weeks.\n    3. Consider Hydrocortisone if blood pressure does not improve with appropriate doses of Dopamine.\nH. Sedatives or analgesics should be initiated either in DR (during a prolonged resuscitation) or upon arrival to NICU.\n    1. Provide pain relief with Morphine 0.05-0.1mg/kg q 6 hrs and **lightly** sedate with continuous drip of Midazolam (start at lowest dose).\nI. Place NIRS monitor (cerebral and renal)\nJ. Obtain ECHO within 24 hours after birth. ECHO will evaluate for cardiac anomalies (present in about 25% of CDH patients), heart function, and severity of pulmonary hypertension.\n\n<a id='832a2db3-6888-43d0-921a-e7b60a1ca915'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Consult the following services: Pediatric Surgery, Cardiology and Genetics (additional congenital anomalies are present in 10-40% of CDH patients)\n\n<a id='efc0c881-5556-4757-8075-39e5314286ec'></a>\n\nV. **Management of the Critically-ill CDH Infant**\n\nA. The focus is to tolerate marginal pulmonary gas exchange and maintain adequate cerebral oxygen delivery. Goal cerebral NIRS > 60%.\n\n1. Post-ductal saturations as low as 60% are acceptable as long as pre-ductal saturations remain ≥85% and perfusion is satisfactory. Post-ductal PaO2 values as low as 30 mmHg are common and do not represent a need to escalate therapy. PaCO2 values in the mid-60s are tolerated if the patient is otherwise stable. NaHCO3 can be given to keep pH >7.2 even in the presence of hypercarbia. A 1:2 I: E ratio is used if the IMV rate is >30 with a inspiratory time of 0.6 sec for rates <30. An IMV rate of 100 is not uncommon. PIP is kept ≤25 or Paw ≤15 except for rare increases to 28 and 17, respectively, for decreased chest movement/lung expansion or to bridge to ECMO.\n\n<a id='54900116-996c-4b71-89fc-8df6164b3d21'></a>\n\nB. Use of inhaled Nitric Oxide (iNO) and ECMO\n\n1. Consider iNO in patients who cannot maintain pre-ductal saturations >85% or post-ductal PaO2 >30, have a pre/post-ductal saturation differential > 10%, or who show evidence of inadequate oxygen delivery based on rising lactate levels. iNO is initiated at a dose of 20 ppm. Obtain ECHO before initiating iNO if possible. iNO is most helpful in the setting of elevated PVR with right to left shunting at the ductal and atrial level and preductal desaturation. In the setting of left to right shunting at the atrial level and poor LV function, pulmonary vasodilation may worsen left atrial and pulmonary venous hypertension and increase the risk of pulmonary hemorrhage. An RCT did not demonstrate a reduced need for ECMO or death, however iNO use remains common in this patient population and may be used as a bridge to ECMO. Monitor for response to treatment. If there is no response after 1 hour of treatment, iNO may be discontinued. Response to iNO is defined as: a decrease of 10-20% in the pre/post-ductal saturation differential, or an increase of 10-20% in PaO2, or an improvement in hemodynamic parameters (10% increase in blood pressure, or a decrease in lactate levels). If there is no improvement in oxygenation despite maximal ventilator support and iNO then proceed to ECMO.\n2. Small studies and meta-analyses have concluded that ECMO use improves survival in this patient population. Often the usual OI criteria are modified due to the desire to limit barotrauma and pre-ductal saturations are used in conjunction with other clinical data.\n\n<a id='6cc34e7a-aa18-4cfc-9da3-4ca03ffe8e72'></a>\n\nThe following are indications for ECMO:\n\na. Inability to maintain pre-ductal saturations despite initiation of HFOV and iNO\nb. PIP >24 or Paw > 15 cm H2O to achieve pre-ductal saturation > 85%\nc. OI \\u2265 40 for at least 3 hours\nd. Inadequate oxygen delivery with resultant metabolic acidosis: lactate \\u2265 5mmol/L and pH < 7.15\ne. pCO2 > 70 resulting in a respiratory acidosis with pH < 7.15, despite optimization of ventilator management\nf. Hypotension resistant to fluid resuscitation and adequate inotropic support resulting in a urine output of < 0.5ml/kg/hr for 12-24 hours\n\n<a id='8f7d9e84-b2ef-44b0-8917-6a558e942fb7'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Either VV or VA ECMO can be used and there is no evidence of superiority for one modality over the other. ECMO runs in CDH patients are often long. Pulmonary outcomes can still be excellent and arbitrary limitation of ECMO duration to <4 weeks should be avoided.\n\n<a id='1a6e2764-91e1-4f9a-b94c-8af74e98d835'></a>\n\n3. Second ECMO runs have been used in this patient population with success rates varying from 36% to 44%. This survival compares favorably with the overall ECMO survival of 51% reported in the International ELSO Registry.\n\n<a id='0c5fc3cd-02f1-40c9-9eeb-1bbff52e3f29'></a>\n\n### C. Pulmonary Hypertension Management and Use of Other Vasoactive Medications\n\nPulmonary hypertension in CDH is related to a decreased cross-sectional area of the pulmonary vascular bed with pulmonary hypoplasia and adventitial and medial wall thickening due to increased smooth muscle cells in pulmonary arteries. Increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) can lead to right to left shunting with hypoxemia and pre/post-ductal saturation differential. Shunting may also occur at the level of the foramen ovale, in which case there may not be a significant pre/post-ductal saturation differential. An ECHO should be performed in the first 24 hours after birth to assess for the degree of pulmonary hypertension as well as to evaluate both right and left heart function. If pre-ductal saturations are < 85%, despite changes to ventilator parameters, and there are signs of poor organ perfusion, pulmonary hypertension should be treated. Initial steps include optimizing intravascular volume, transfusion to maintain Hct > 40%, and use of inotropes to maintain blood pressure at normal levels for the gestational age. Following these measures, iNO should be initiated at 20ppm.\n\n<a id='64611a49-f59e-4822-a31d-8543cefc6d0c'></a>\n\nWhen there is abnormal left ventricular function and signs of RV dependent systemic circulation demonstrated by ECHO, both Milrinone and PGE can be used.\n\n1. Milrinone, a Phosphodiesterase-3 inhibitor, has been used in CDH associated with elevated PVR and RV dependent systemic circulation due to abnormal LV function. The rationale for its use is three-fold: direct pulmonary vasodilation, improved systolic function; and as a lusitropic agent it improves diastolic function. It has been shown to improve RV systolic and diastolic function by ECHO and improve oxygenation. Doses used range from 0.50-0.75 mcg/kg/min. (0.025-0.75 mg/kg/min).\n\n2. Prostaglandin E1: PGE, has been used in several small studies to maintain ductal patency and stabilize LV and RV function. When there is systemic to supra-systemic pulmonary pressures, the RV becomes overloaded and enlarged. Enlargement of the RV with bowing of the intraventricular septum can impair LV filling and result in poor systemic perfusion. Severe LV dysfunction leads to dependence on the RV for systemic perfusion and thus there may be benefit from strategies to main ductal patency. Doses used are generally 5-10 ng/kg/min (0.005-0.01mcg/kg/min).\n\n3. Sildenafil: Sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor, has primarily been used in the management of chronic pulmonary hypertension in the post-operative period in neonates with CDH. Intravenous sildenafil is available but not FDA approved. There are limited data on efficacy of IV sildenafil for treatment in the acute phase, but in small retrospective cohort studies, sildenafil was associated with ECHO evidence of reduced PVR.\n\n<a id='42d3e99c-b593-41ad-9a2a-2baab5b6a683'></a>\n\n## VI. Timing of Surgical Repair\n\nTiming of CDH repair has varied over the last 3 decades. Initially patients were operated on soon after birth, but in the 1990s there was a change in practice to delay repair until physiologic stability was achieved. The definition of 'physiologic stability and delayed repair' is center dependent and timing of repair ranges from days to weeks. There is no evidence that delayed repair results in improved survival. New evidence suggests that timing of repair should be dependent on the severity of the defect and degree of lung hypoplasia. Severity can be defined by multiple factors such as side of defect (right vs. left), size of defect, degree of abdominal content herniation, liver- up vs. liver-down, defect size as determined at the time of repair, and prenatal measurements of lung size or volume\n\n<a id='18cff307-c677-4377-aac7-7fe1baa5fb8f'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Physiologic parameters after birth may also predict survival and need for ECMO. The relationship between timing of surgical repair and survival appears to vary by severity of the defect and degree of lung hypoplasia. Those with left liver-down CDH have been shown to benefit from a delay in surgical repair of > 48 hours after birth. Repair prior to 48 hours resulted in an increased need for ECMO without improvement in survival. For those with liver-up CDH, a significant delay in repair may result in increased mortality. A recent study found that neonates with left liver-up CDH had reduced mortality if they were repaired prior to going on ECMO. In a cohort of 87 ECMO eligible left liver-up patients, 60 required ECMO (69%). 20 of 21 (95%) repaired in the first 60 hours after birth and before ECMO survived; whereas only 13 of 20 (65%) who had repair delayed and arrived to ECMO unrepaired survived (p=0.02). Timing of repair should be discussed on a daily basis with the Pediatric Surgeons.\n\n<a id='34dd8668-90bf-4d58-b7ac-4dd02c2043d5'></a>\n\nVII. **Guidelines for Weaning Respiratory Support**\n\nA. FiO2 Weaning\n\n1. Goal is to maintain a pre-ductal saturation 85-95% or PaO2 60-90 mmHg. Start weaning when pre-ductal saturations have stabilized. Wean for pre-ductal saturations > 95%. Goal is to wean to FiO2 < 45%.\n\nB. Conventional Ventilator\n\n1. Wean PIP/PC before rate depending on tidal volume to keep goal PaCO2 as described above.\n2. Adjust FiO2 as needed to maintain pre-ductal SaO2 as described above.\n\nC. High Frequency Ventilation\n\n1. Wean FiO2 to achieve goal pre-ductal saturations.\n2. Wean Paw only if the infant is on less than 60% oxygen and lung expansion is greater than 8 ribs.\n3. Adjust amplitude or frequency to maintain target PaCO2. Increase frequency before amplitude if frequency is <10.\n\nD. Weaning Inhaled Nitric Oxide\n\n<a id='2500883c-1aa7-4a57-aba3-06f773d38f23'></a>\n\n1. iNO should be weaned only after the infant is stable on < 60% oxygen and is on reasonable Paw if on HFOV or PIP if on SIMV. Discuss the timing of surgery before weaning pulmonary vasodilators because of a possible increase in pulmonary vascular resistance after surgery.\n2. iNO should be weaned slowly over 24 hours.\n\n<a id='efe87e8f-e9db-4751-98dd-0bb254226b1c'></a>\n\n## VIII. Considerations Prior to Discharge\n\nA. Brain MRI should be obtained prior to discharge in any patient with a severe neonatal course (prolonged mechanical ventilation or ECMO). MRI findings of delayed maturation, white matter injury (PVL) and white matter volume loss have been reported in this population. Evidence of brain injury on MRI may facilitate obtaining interventional therapies at an earlier age after discharge.\n\nB. Due to the risk of neurocognitive delay, all patients should be referred for follow-up in the High-Risk Infant Follow-Up clinic.\n\nC. Late-onset hearing loss occurs in up to 30% of CDH patients. Newborn hearing screen results are not predictive of which patient will develop sensorineural hearing loss. Predictors include prolonged mechanical ventilation, ECMO, large defect size, and duration of treatment with loop diuretics and exposure to aminoglycosides. All patients should be referred for outpatient audiology exams at the time of discharge with\n\n<a id='f31b2d68-688a-4fc2-a0de-73c724b56837'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

OT follow-up after discharge is important, as many neonates with CDH will develop feeding difficulties and oral aversion.\nE. RSV prophylaxis should be given to all patients with CDH prior to discharge during the RSV season.\n\n<a id='91f4280f-80e5-4e1c-80d7-624520e40856'></a>\n\nIX. LPCH CDH Survival Results\n\nWe have submitted data to the CDH Study Group since 1995. The most recent report includes babies born after January 1, 2007 and compares survival by defect type. Type A is most mild and type D is complete agenesis of the diaphragm. Overall LPCH survival is 78% compared to mean international survival of 71%, isolated CDH survival at LPCH is 86% compared to international survival of 75%. Most notable is our success with most severe group D where we have survival 73% compared to international survival of 58%. Similarly, our CDH ECMO survival is 67% compared with international results 52%\n\n<a id='2fdb3ed9-faf3-4f2b-8e1e-4c4600dcf96b'></a>\n\nReferences\n1.

General\n\nA. ECMO is the use of prolonged extracorporeal circulation and gas exchange via a modified heart-lung machine to provide temporary life support in patients with cardiac and/or respiratory failure who are refractory to maximum ventilatory and medical management. 1 ECMO patients are cared for by a separate service staffed by Drs. Krisa Van Meurs, Bill Rhine, Lou Halamek, Sonia Bonifacio, Valerie Chock, Alexis Davis, Jon Palma, Nicole Yamada, and Shazia Bhombal. You will need to know how to identify potential ECMO candidates, how to ready your patient for ECMO, and how to care for the infant following ECMO.\n\n<a id='30ec00a5-9416-4440-9136-e6e4b0510b4f'></a>\n\nII. **ECMO Criteria**\n\n1. The neonatal ECMO criteria at LPCH are the following:\n\n   1. Gestational age ≥34 wks and weight ≥2.0 kg.\n   2. No intracranial hemorrhage >grade II.\n   3. No lethal congenital anomalies.\n   4. Infant has not required mechanical ventilation for a prolonged period of time.\n   5. Cardiac or respiratory failure despite maximal medical therapy with a mortality estimated to be approximately 80%. The most commonly used quantitative measurement is an Oxygenation Index (OI) >40 on 2 ABGs 30 min apart or OI > 20 for 24 hours without improvement despite prolonged maximal medical therapy or persistent episodes of decompensation.\n\nOI = (Mean Airway Pressure) (FiO2)(100) / PaO2\n\n<a id='f82e5b59-cf56-4f69-8318-a408db025281'></a>\n\n### III. Pre-ECMO Procedures\n\nInfants who are being considered for ECMO should receive:\n\nA. **Echocardiogram**: The echocardiogram is to exclude congenital heart disease, look for pulmonary hypertension, and also to check the fractional shortening, which will help decide whether the infant will receive venovenous (VV) or venoarterial (VA) ECMO. VA ECMO provides complete cardio-respiratory support via 2 catheters in the internal jugular vein and carotid artery, while VV ECMO provides respiratory support alone via a single dual lumen catheter in the internal jugular vein.2\n\nB. **Head Ultrasound**: This is done to check for significant intracranial hemorrhage, which could extend with the systemic heparinization. Intracranial hemorrhage is one of the risks associated with ECMO and occurs in 5-10% of ECMO patients.3 It occurs at higher rates in those of lower gestational age and with other risk factors such as asphyxia, acidosis, and coagulation abnormalities. If there is a Grade I or II bleed, ECMO is still feasible, however the ECMO doctors may choose to use less heparin and an antifibrinolytic agent, Amicar®.4\n\nC. **Coagulation Studies**: A PT, PTT, fibrinogen, and platelet count should be sent on patients being considered for ECMO. Any coagulation abnormalities should be corrected prior to ECMO cannulation\n\nD. **ECMO Consent**: The ECMO attending and NICU fellow will take obtain the consent and notify the ECMO team, which includes the Perfusionist, OR Charge Nurse, and Pediatric Surgeon.\n\nE. **Blood Product Ordering**:\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Not for outside reproduction or publication without permission.\n\n<a id='d3a11232-f9b1-4820-83c9-ab466a4a6606'></a>\n\n160 Part II-B: Respiratory\n\n1. For emergency ECMO when there is no ABO/Rh type, use order set in EPIC \"ECMO Emergency Priming – with Uncrossmatched Blood Products\" which includes: 2 units of type O, Rh negative packed RBCs and 50 ml FFP type AB to be used for circuit priming.\n2. For non-emergency ECMO 2 units dry packed RBCs and 50 ml FFP for priming are ordered. This order is part of the ECMO (NICU) order set in EPIC.\n3. Give 10 mL/kg unpacked platelets ASAP once on bypass.\n4. Whenever ECMO is being performed in the NICU, an emergency RBC unit will be kept in the NICU.\n\n<a id='c5a42404-11d7-4a4c-8391-08fbd0a33806'></a>\n\n**F. ECMO Orders:**\n1. There are specific order sets which should be completed for any patient to be placed on ECMO, these are completed by the neonatal fellow or ECMO attending.\n\n<a id='0c835918-3d62-4ed5-ade6-5f2fcf8a0ebb'></a>\n\n## IV. Post-ECMO Procedures\n\nAfter the patient is decannulated, you will again assume responsibility for their care. You will receive a signout from the ECMO doctors. In general, some of the post-ECMO concerns will be:\n\nA. **Respiratory**: In general, patients weaned off ECMO no longer have PPHN physiology. The respiratory care goals will be normal gases with pH 7.35-7.45, PaCO2 40-50, and PaO2 60-80. After the infant has awakened from the vecuronium and fentanyl given for the decannulation procedure, the ventilator can be weaned. Most ECMO patients are extubated within 48-72 hrs after ECMO with the exception of infants with CDH, who may still have PPHN, require longer periods of ventilation post-ECMO, and require more gradual weaning of mechanical ventilation.\n\nB. **Fluids, Electrolytes, and Nutrition**: The fluid and electrolyte requirements on ECMO are different and generally patients require more KCI (4 mEq/kg) and less NaCl (2 mEq/kg). Patients are generally fluid restricted on ECMO and develop some edema while on bypass. The TPN on ECMO has a high dextrose concentration and the patient receives limited lipids. The post-ECMO TPN orders will need to be changed. The total IV fluid rate will depend on the fluid status, but the NaCl should be increased to 3 mEq/kg and the KCL decreased to 2mEq/kg. Electrolytes will need to be checked 2 times daily for 48 hrs. The total glucose given (mg/kg/min) may be kept the same, but the dextrose concentration will decrease as several drips will be discontinued (heparin drip, sedation, and possibly Amicar®). The intralipids can also be advanced once off ECMO.\n\nC. **Hematologic**: ECMO patients receive frequent platelet transfusions while on ECMO to keep their platelet count >80-100K and decrease the risk of bleeding complications. The platelet count and hematocrit should be checked twice daily for 48 hrs. Post ECMO patients should receive a platelet transfusion for platelet count<75,000 in the first 24-48 hours following decannulation\n\nD. **Neurologic**: ECMO patients receive a daily HUS during the first week on bypass; less frequent exams may be done thereafter depending on the individual patient, and are monitored with NIRS and aEEG. No further HUS will be needed after ECMO, but an MRI is ordered when the infant is extubated or prior to return transport. This is done to check for intracranial hemorrhage, cerebral infarct or extra-axial fluid collections.\n\nE. **Follow-up**: ECMO patients are seen in the Developmental and Behavioral Clinic at 4 mos, 12 mos, and 2 yrs to assess neurodevelopmental outcome, respiratory outcomes, and hearing. All infants placed on ECMO should be referred for outpatient audiology evaluation. As a group, ECMO survivors are at increased risk of behavioral and school difficulties, although mean IQ is within the normal range. The rate of major disabilityand mental retardation is comparable to other high-risk populations.5 Please have an appointment scheduled prior\n\n<a id='b8bdd944-497f-4425-bb09-3c878be40e1a'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

This pattern is common in preterm infants, maybe due to instability of respiratory\ncontrol center. This is a typical breathing pattern in full-term and pre-term infants during active (rapid eye\nmovement, REM) sleep.\n\nE. **Apnea types**:\n\n1. **Central**: breathing pause without respiratory effort.\n\n2. **Obstructive**: e.g., respiratory effort without effective ventilation and airflow; may be associated with\nmechanical/anatomic abnormality or failure to maintain upper airway muscle tone during inspiration.\n\n3. **Mixed**: Usually a central respiratory pause preceded or followed by airway obstruction.\n\nII. **Differential Diagnosis of Apnea**\n\nA. **Infection**: especially with history of prolonged rupture of membranes, maternal fever, central lines, RSV in the\nolder infant.\n\nB. **Impaired oxygenation**: pallor, shock, L-to-R shunt through PDA, anemia, pulmonary edema, and heart\nfailure.\n\nC. **Metabolic disorders**: hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalance, lactic acidosis.\n\nD. **Drugs**: maternal opiates, anti-convulsants, prostaglandin, magnesium.\n\nE. **Neurologic**: seizures, asphyxia, intracranial hemorrhage, brain malformation, increased intracranial pressure\ndue to hydrocephalus.\n\nF. **Feeding-related**: Association with gastroesophageal reflux \"GER\" in the full-term infant and pre-term infant is\ntenuous and should not be assumed without good supporting evidence such as a pH Probe Study. (See NICU\nGuide Section II.F. \"Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease\".) Dysphagia and aspiration can also cause apnea,\nparticularly in patients with a history of tracheo-esophageal fistula, laryngomalacia, or neurologic dysfunction\n\nG. **Thermal instability**: Both hyper- and hypothermia can cause apnea.\n\nH. **Idiopathic**: apnea of prematurity, respiratory drive instability.\n\nI. **Pulmonary disease**: decreased lung compliance (e.g., RDS, pneumonia), increased work-of-breathing.\n\nJ. **Airway obstruction**: anatomic, malposition of trachea associated with neck flexion, excessive oral secretions.\n\n<a id='ea6860ba-3442-4fbb-8f5d-8a7c05783576'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Pathogenesis\n\nA. **Chemoreceptor function:** Preterm infants have a biphasic response to hypoxemia, with a transient increase in ventilation followed by a sustained depression of ventilation. Carbon dioxide responsiveness is a predominantly central chemoreceptor activity and is less well-developed the more immature the infant. Hypoxemia and hyperoxia also make the preterm infant less responsive to carbon dioxide.\n\nB. **Respiratory center depression:** The frequency of apnea decreases as the brainstem function improves with increasing post-menstrual age (PMA). Respiratory center activity may be impaired by general CNS depressants and changes in ambient temperature.\n\nC. **Sleep state:** Apnea occurs predominantly during active (REM) sleep and indeterminate (transitional) sleep in both preterm and term infants. This may be due to paradoxical chest wall movements (vagal inhibition of intercostal muscles) and decreased FRC during active sleep.\n\nD. **Obstruction:** Airway obstruction may occur spontaneously with infant-initiated neck flexion or passively (e.g., inappropriately placed face mask).\n\nE. **Reflexes:** Active reflexes caused by stimulation of the posterior pharynx (with a suction catheter) of the eyes (e.g. during bag mask ventilation area oculovagal reflex) can incite apnea.\n\nF. **Pulmonary insufficiency of prematurity:** when pulmonary function is insufficient for metabolic needs of the infant.\n\n### IV. Incidence of Apnea of Prematurity\n\nA. Incidence is inversely related to PMA.\n\nB. Generally begins at 1-2 days of age but can start any time during the hospitalization.\n\nC. Persists for variable length of time. Usually decreases by 37 wks PMA;\n   1. May last longer for infants <28 wks gestation at birth.\n   2. May persist beyond 40 wks PMA, either as mild events during sleep, or with feeds.\n\nD. Abnormal for term or near-term infants, look for identifiable cause.\n\nE. No relationship between apnea of prematurity and later SIDS.\n\n### V. Evaluation of the Apneic Infant\n\nA. **Complete history and physical examination:** assess frequency, duration, and temporal association of apneic events.\n\nB. **Respiratory evaluation:**\n   1. ABG (look for hypoxia, acidosis, hypercarbia)\n   2. CXR (look for pulmonary problem e.g., atelectasis, pulmonary edema or infiltrates)\n\nC. **Infectious disease:**\n   1. CBC with manual differential.\n\n<a id='ad4b5db7-6af4-4568-ba90-9d4a7f00b8e8'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Electrolytes, calcium, magnesium, glucose.\n2. Drug levels (if on methylxanthine or CNS depressant).\n3. Consider inborn error of metabolism.\n\nE. Neurologic:\n\n1. Head ultrasound (if intracranial hemorrhage or post-hemmorhagic hydocephalus suspected).\n2. MRI (if brain abnormality suspected).\n3. If seizures suspected, obtain an aEEG; consider anticonvulsants, request neurology consult.\n4. Sleep/apnea study (to clarify type of apnea, frequency, duration, and associated events).\n\nF. Cardiac: Consider PDA in preterms.\n\nG. Gastrointestinal: Gastroesophageal Reflux (GER) on a pH probe study is found commonly and may be physiologic in preterm and term infants, but it is usually not the cause for apnea in the preterm infant. An apnea pH study may be helpful to clarify this issue but again this association rarely is found to be the cause for apnea in the preterm infant. The use of histamine blockers does not stop GER, and does have associate risk (e.g., NEC). A Modified Barium Swallow can diagnose dysphagia and aspiration from above. The OT sta will usually assess the patient clinically first, and will participate in the Modified Barium Swallow if deemed indicated. Since both are common in premature infants, and may resolve with maturation, work-up for either GERD or swallow dysfunction should be delayed until the patient is close to maturity (> 37 wk PMA) unless there is a strong indication (e.g., tracheo-esophageal fistula).\n\nH. Hematologic: The association between anemia and apnea is weak and our ability to predict which patient's symptoms will respond to transfusion is poor. Avoid transfusion unless there are other symptoms suggestive of anemia (e.g., tachycardia, poor weight gain).\n\n<a id='575ca627-8999-4f67-b91e-76ce2eee426e'></a>\n\n## VI. Treatment\n\nA. Treat any underlying causes, if identified.\n\n1. Treat hypoxemia/hypercarbia with supplemental oxygen to keep pO2 60-80; avoid reflexes that may trigger apnea; consider drug therapy.\n2. Nasal Cannula O2, or CPAP may help if obstructive process or pulmonary insufficiency of prematurity is cause.\n3. Consider blood transfusion depending on level of anemia and hypoxemia.\n4. Mechanical ventilation, if above interventions fail.\n\n<a id='aef7f57a-c501-4e51-8ac3-ac4da5f86665'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Caffeine citrate: Methylxanthines act mainly on brainstem respiratory neurons, producing a central stimulatory effect, but may also improve diaphragmatic contractility (non-specific inhibitors of adenosine receptors). Caffeine is preferred over theophylline because it has a longer half-life and allows more stable blood levels, and its broader therapeutic range allowing us to forego monitoring blood levels. At LPCH, caffeine is ordered as caffeine citrate.\n\n<a id='b142d11b-585c-4b30-b387-ea159d3fec8d'></a>\n\n1. Loading dose: 20 mg/kg IV or PO.\n2. Maintenance: 5 mg/kg daily IV or PO.\n3. Caffeine for prophylaxis of apnea of prematurity may be effective for ELBW infants.\n4. Caffeine has been associated with a decreased incidence of both BPD and Cerebral Palsy in infants with a birth weight <1250 g.\n5. Caffeine has been used to prevent post-operative apnea/brady/desats in growing preterm infants.\n6. Caffeine should be stopped at 34-35 wks PMA or 5-days without significant apnea, whichever comes first:\n   a. Monitor for ≥ 5 days off caffeine while serum levels drop below therapeutic.\n   b. Apnea beyond 38 wks PMA suggests an etiology other than prematurity.\n   c. Recent literature suggests that longer treatment with Caffeine might be helpful for preterm infants with persistent Apnea without any other pathogenesis.\n7. Insignificant events, not requiring intervention, home monitoring, resumption of caffeine, or delay of discharge include (in appropriate babies):\n   a.

Oxygen is a drug; it is probably the most widely used drug in the intensive care setting. Although oxygen can be life-saving, it can also be toxic.\n\n1. Use of 100% oxygen in incubators during the 1940s and 1950s was linked to a very high incidence of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) - as the oxygen concentration was decreased over the 1950's and 1960's, the ROP rate dropped.\n2. Evidence shows that reactive oxygen species, like superoxide, in combination with other factors, can lead to inflammation and damage of tissues and organs including the lung. This may play an important role in the development of chronic lung disease.\n3. Antioxidant defense systems are likely to be decreased and impaired in premature infants, so our patients are at even higher risk for damage due to oxygen toxicity.\n4. A number of studies led to the recognition that an optimal range for oxygen saturation and PaO2 had not been elucidated fully for preterm infants receiving supplemental oxygen. Subsequently, several recent randomized controlled trials have investigated oxygen saturation targets within the AAP recommended ranges.\n\na. Several trials from 1950s to 1970s compared unrestricted oxygen supplementation (FiO2>50%) for 2-7 weeks with more \"restricted\" oxygen supplementation to ≤50% inspired oxygen concentration regardless of the condition of the preterm infants.\n\ni. The practice of \"restricted\" oxygen was NOT associated with an increase in mortality.\nii. A meta-analysis of 5 trials showed that oxygen restriction decreased the incidence and severity of retinopathy without an effect on mortality.\n\nb. A retrospective study reviewing different oxygenation policies in England for infants born less than 28 weeks suggested that keeping target oxygen saturations in the range 70-90% was associated with a lower rate of threshold ROP and shorter duration of time on oxygen and on the ventilator compared with a higher target range. No improvement in survival or rate of cerebral palsy was seen in the higher saturation group.\n\nc. Another retrospective study of 7 United States NICUs reported that in infants 500-1000 g, a policy of accepting lower O2 saturations was associated with LOWER rates of CLD, severe ROP, and ROP requiring surgery. There was no difference in survival rates between groups.\n\nd. A study comparing resuscitation at birth with room air vs. 100% oxygen in term infants followed markers for oxidant stress and antioxidant enzymes at birth, 72 hrs after birth, and 28 days after birth. The infants resuscitated with room air had increased markers for oxidant stress and antioxidant enzymes compared to non-asphyxiated infants at 72 hrs of age. The infants resuscitated with 100% oxygen had significantly higher levels than infants resuscitated with room air. At 28 days of life the markers for the infant resuscitated with room air were the same as for the non-asphyxiated infants, but the infants resuscitated with 100% oxygen still had significantly higher markers for oxidant stress and antioxidant enzymes at 28 days of life.\n\ne.

Therefore, randomized controlled trails were undertaken to attempt to determine the best target range _within the recommended guidelines_ for extremely preterm infants.\n\n<a id='e9b99031-6357-4eb3-a68f-4f01c2302aa8'></a>\n\n5. Recent Randomized Controlled Trials\n\na. The SUPPORT trial of the NICHD Neonatal Research Network was a 2x2 factorial, multi-center study designed to compare 2 approaches to early respiratory management (Finer N, NEJM 2010) and 2 ranges of oxygen saturation (85-89% vs. 91-95%) among infants born at 24 to <28 weeks of gestation. The lower oxygenation arm did not significantly decrease the composite outcome of severe ROP or death, but did result in an increase in mortality and a substantial decrease in severe ROP among survivors.\n\nb. The BOOST II trial (UK, Australia, New Zealand) also compared the same 2 oxygen saturation ranges (85-89% vs. 91-95%) among <28 week EGA infants. The lower oxygenation arm was associated with a significantly increased risk for death, and a significantly decreased risk for ROP.\n\nc. The COT trial (Canada, US, Argentina, Finland, Germany, Israel) showed differing results. In extremely preterm infants, targeting oxygen saturations of 85% to 89% compared with 91% to 95% had no significant effect on the rate of death or disability at 18 months.\n\nd. A recent meta-analysis of these major international studies6 reported \"no significant differences in death or disability at 24 months, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy of prematurity, neurodevelopmental outcomes, or hearing loss at 24 months.\"\n\ne. However, one recent paper did seem to show a decrease in severe ROP & laser treatment with increased O2 saturations at PMA ≥ 36 wk.\n\n<a id='5174f59c-dc30-40f2-9dfc-e725f27f3afd'></a>\n\n## II. Oxygen Therapy for Pre-threshold ROP\n\nA. The STOP-ROP study investigated the possibility that supplemental oxygen might reduce the progression of prethreshold ROP to threshold ROP. The findings indicated that use of supplemental oxygen did not cause any further progression, but also didn't reduce the need for eye surgery in most patients. One subgroup of patients, those without plus disease treated with supplemental oxygen, had a lower rate of progression to threshold.\n\nB. There is ongoing debate about the best way to treat prethreshold ROP, but supplemental oxygen may be beneficial in a particular subgroup of patients. At Stanford, we currently use supplemental oxygen for some patients with prethreshold disease\n\n<a id='b68bfd4b-4673-472d-b216-eed672d9ede6'></a>\n\n### III.

It occurs mainly in infants who are born very prematurely and who require prolonged assisted ventilation to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome (hyaline membrane disease), sustained or recurrent apnea or respiratory failure from sepsis or pneumonia. The condition also develops in some mature infants who are treated with long-term mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure from meconium aspiration, bacterial or viral pneumonia, lung hypoplasia or cardiopulmonary malformations.\n\nB. In 1989, the Bureau of Maternal and Child Health and Resources Development proposed the following diagnostic criteria for BPD:\n\n   1. Requirement for positive pressure ventilation during the first 2 weeks of life. Minimum requirement of ventilation for 3 days.\n   2. Clinical signs of respiratory compromise persisting beyond 28 days of age.\n   3. Requirement for supplemental oxygen beyond 28 days of age in order to maintain a PaO2 of greater than 50 Torr.\n   4. Chest radiographs showing characteristic lung abnormalities (diffuse bilateral densities, often associated with areas of hyperinflation).\n\nC. The definition has been modified to specify a need for supplemental oxygen for greater than 28 days, or extending beyond 36 weeks post-menstrual age [PMA], accompanied by characteristic radiographic abnormalities.\n\nD. An NIH-sponsored workshop on BPD reached a consensus to refer to this disease as BPD instead of CLD to distinguish it from chronic lung diseases seen in later life. A more extensive definition was proposed which uses oxygen dependency at 36 PMA (failure to maintain normal oxygen saturation when breathing room air), and defines mild, moderate, and severe disease. A recent report supported the validity of the more refined definitions of BPD severity according to need for supplemental oxygen and/or positive-pressure breathing at 36 wks PMA. This \"physiologic\" definition of BPD is preferred at LPCH.\n\nE. Most recently, it has been reported that surviving very low gestational age infants may be at risk of impaired lung function in childhood even if they pass the proposed physiologic testing.\n\n<a id='13018846-16a8-47f2-b597-c4058345201b'></a>\n\n## II. Incidence\n\nA. The incidence of BPD is variable between newborn care centers, reflecting not only differences in patient population and infant management practices, but also the different criteria used to define BPD.\n\nB. Recent reports indicate that the incidence of BPD varies from 15-50% in infants whose birth weight is 1500 gm or less and who require assisted ventilation for initial respiratory distress, with most reports showing about a 20-25% incidence of BPD among infants with a birth weight between 500-1500 gm who have received mechanical ventilation.\n\nC. The incidence of BPD is inversely related to gestational age, varying from 80% or more among the most immature infants (less than 24 weeks gestation) to under 5% among infants beyond 32 weeks gestation.\n\n<a id='0874c60c-9b6a-4e30-b0ad-6e41ef643b54'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

The initiating event in BPD is considered to be inflammation of the incompletely developed newborn lung. The condition may be associated with chorioamnionitis before birth, systemic infection after birth, or pulmonary accumulation of activated neutrophils, which has been described in hyaline membrane disease, aspiration syndromes, pneumonia, and prolonged application of positive-pressure mechanical ventilation.\n\nB. Deficiency of anti-oxidant enzymes and inhibitors of proteolytic enzymes renders the very immature infant's lungs especially vulnerable to the effects of toxic oxygen metabolites and proteases that are released during inflammation by activated neutrophils and macrophages.\n\nC. **Conditions that are associated with BPD:**\n\n1. Prematurity (especially extreme lung immaturity).\n2. Repetitive stretch and overinflation of the lungs (\"volutrauma\") associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation using large tidal volumes and high inflation pressures.\n3. Oxygen toxicity (related to the magnitude and duration of exposure to supplemental oxygen, and owing to the relative deficiency of antioxidant enzymes in the immature lung).\n4. Development of pulmonary air leaks, notably interstitial emphysema, and pneumothoraces.\n5. Lung edema: excessive fluid and salt intake, persistence of a patent ductus arteriosus, myocardial dysfunction.\n6. Infection and associated inflammation, sometimes with chorioamnionitis before birth, sepsis or pneumonia after birth or acquisition of nosocomial infections.\n7. Conditions that may contribute to acute lung injury and non-uniform lung expansion: aspiration of gastric contents, incorrect placement of the endotracheal tube, improper delivery of surfactant, airway obstruction from mucous plugs.\n8. Other factors: poor nutritional support, genetic predisposition to reactive airways disease, vitamin A deficiency, insufficient adrenal and thyroid hormone release in the very premature infant, gastro-esophageal reflux, and associated aspiration pneumonitis.\n\n<a id='b7cdc882-7ba7-4c07-9957-4b4d3796a423'></a>\n\nD. Pulmonary Dysfunction in BPD:\n\n1. Increased lung vascular resistance, typically associated with impaired responsiveness to inhaled nitric oxide and other vasodilators, sometimes progressing to right heart failure which, in turn, may impair lung lymphatic drainage.\n2. Increased respiratory tract resistance and hyper-reactive airways leading to episodic bronchoconstriction and cyanosis.\n3. Impaired respiratory gas exchange (hypoxemia with need for supplemental oxygen, alveolar hypoventilation with resultant hypercapnia), mismatch of ventilation and perfusion.\n4. Diminished lung compliance, tachypnea, and increased minute ventilation and work of breathing.\n5. Increased lung microvascular filtration pressure that leads to interstitial pulmonary edema.\n\n<a id='c22de359-7d3c-4965-9238-c836f1eea2e7'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Structural and molecular abnormalities of the lung in BPD:\n\n1. Increased smooth muscle in small pulmonary arteries and airways.\n2. Decreased numbers of terminal respiratory units (alveoli and secondary crests); increased alveolar size.\n3. Decreased numbers of microvessels, with reduced pulmonary expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and VEGF receptors.\n4. Increased abundance and abnormal distribution of elastin in the lung parenchyma and circulation with increased pulmonary expression of tropoelastin mRNA.\n5. Interstitial pulmonary edema.\n6. Diminished endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) in lung blood vessels and airways.\n7. Increased numbers of neutrophils early in course with increased numbers of macrophages later in the course.\n\n<a id='d4de4a36-cb15-4565-8dc1-cba8d716b65a'></a>\n\nIV. **Treatment**\n\nA. The best approach for preventing or reducing the severity of BPD is to adopt strategies that minimize risk of lung injury and avoid conditions that likely contribute to lung injury.\n\n1.  Antenatal glucocorticoids and postnatal surfactant replacement may not prevent BPD, but they are likely to prevent or reduce the severity of acute lung disease after premature birth and thereby lessen the likelihood of severe chronic lung injury.\n\n2.  Early application of Nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (NCPAP) may help to maintain stability of the immature lung and reduce oxygen requirements, thereby lessening the need for mechanical ventilation and supplemental oxygen.\n\n3.  Treatment with a respiratory stimulant, specifically caffeine, reduces the risk of apnea, and has been shown to reduce the incidence of BPD.\n\n4.  Restricting fluid and salt intake in the first week, so that the infant does not exceed fluid and salt losses (actually allowing for diuresis and a progressive loss of ~15% body weight) has been shown to reduce the risk of BPD.\n\n5.  Assisted ventilation: \"Permissive hypercapnia,\" with use of low peak-inflation pressures (PIP), relatively short inspiratory times, and modest positive end-expiratory pressures (PEEP), allowing PaCO2 to be as high as 55 or 60 cm H2O as long as the pH is 7.25 or greater, appears to be a reasonable approach for managing mechanical ventilation of the premature infant with respiratory failure. As the lungs becomemore compliant, weaning from mechanical ventilation should focus on reducing PIP and tidal volume first to avoid lung over distention, waiting until the PIP is <20 cm H2O and the tidal volume is 4-6 mL/kg before reducing respirator rate. Proper heating and humidification of the inspired gas and caution with endotracheal tube suctioning are important considerations for preventing airway injury. It is noteworthy that despite good rationale for application of \"permissive hypercapnia\" to reduce lung injury in preterm infants (keeping PaCO2 55-65 mmHg during mechanical ventilation in the first wk of life), a randomized trial showed no apparent benefit of this approach for infants between 23-28 wks gestation. Nevertheless, it is still an accepted though debated treatment.\n\n<a id='82fb9a50-b3c9-4eab-b7c6-626ee7a006d9'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Early closure of the ductus arteriosus, either by pharmacologic intervention or surgical ligation, was believed to reduce the risk of pulmonary edema and of severe BPD; recent literature has questioned this.\n\n7. Careful and frequent evaluations to detect early signs of infection, meticulous monitoring of aseptic technique in infant handling and in the management of ventilator circuits and airway care, and early initiation of appropriate antimicrobial treatment for infection are critical issues in helping to reduce the incidence and severity of BPD.\n\n8. Although it is important to reduce the inspired oxygen concentration quickly if the oxygen saturation is >96% or PaO2 is >80 mm Hg, it is also important to avoid hypoxemia (O2 saturation <80% or PaO2 <50 mm Hg), which increases pulmonary vascular resistance, fluid filtration lung edema, and airways resistance. Recent studies indicate that either severe hypoxia or severe prolonged hyperoxia may inhibit lung epithelial Na transport and thereby contribute to pulmonary edema. The goal should be to keep the O2 saturation between 90-96% and PaO2 between 50-80 mm Hg. Recent studies have indicated an increased mortality in very low birth weight babies when O2 saturation maintained at < 90%, but a meta- analysis has questioned this. (See NICU Guide Section II.B.11. \"Oxygen Saturation Guidelines\").\n\n9. Other studies have shown that Dopamine, when delivered intravenously at low doses to support systemic blood pressure, can enhance lung epithelial Na transport and thereby facilitate clearance of liquid from the airspaces and resolution of pulmonary edema.\n\n<a id='5114f8c3-cfc0-4630-b84c-2ecc308fcd97'></a>\n\nB. Careful attention to fluid and salt balance is important to help reduce the risk of pulmonary edema.\n\n1. Fluid and heat losses in the very immature infant (<26 wks gestation) during the first few days after birth can be minimized by keeping the infant in a warm, humidified chamber beneath a radiant warmer.\n2. Fluid balance can be monitored effectively by keeping the infant on a bed scale and measuring body weight at frequent intervals, and by keeping accurate records of fluid intake and urine output.\n3. Frequent measurements of serum electrolytes (every 6 hrs for the very immature infant, every 12 hrs for the infant >26 wks gestation) are important in helping to guide fluid therapy. Sodium is withheld from IV fluids for at least the first 24 hrs and is not added until there is an appropriate diuresis (>2 mL/kg/h) and the weight is at least 5% below birthweight.\n4. In a suitably humidified environment, appropriate initial rates of IV fluid intake for the premature infant are:\n\n<a id='bb7739cc-dad7-4f56-a835-fa6e7da401c5'></a>\n\n>28 wks gestation: 60-80 mL/kg\n26-28 wks gestation: 80-100 mL/kg\n<26 wks gestation: 100-120 mL/kg\n\n5. These guidelines assume close monitoring of body weight, intake/output measurements, and serum sodium as noted above.\n\n6. After the brisk diuresis that usually occurs during the first 3-7 days, urine output generally decreases to about 2-4 mL/kg/h, and fluid intake can be adjusted to about 120-150 mL/kg/d.\n\n7. Once on full enteral nutrition, infants without evidence of CHF or renal dysfunction can almost always tolerated greater intake volumes, e.g., 160-180 mL/kg/d.\n\n<a id='59849b90-4e5e-412b-a4ee-84db1090b169'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Nutritional needs of the infant with BPD depend on environmental conditions (goal should be a neutral thermal environment), work of breathing, and general metabolism, which may be slightly greater than for infants without BPD.\n1. Early delivery of parenteral nutrition, including protein and lipid, through a peripherally placed central venous line is helpful in establishing early positive nitrogen balance and facilitating growth and lung repair.\n2. Caloric, protein, and mineral needs usually can be met with fortification of mother's breast milk or with premature infant formula with a caloric density of 24-30 kcal/oz.\n3. Premature infants with BPD require nutritional supplements of calcium and phosphorus, in addition to adequate vitamins, and if they are receiving diuretics they also may require additional potassium and chloride.\n\nD. Diuretics: Diuretics must be used with caution because of their potential complications, which include electrolyte deficiencies (notably of sodium, potassium, and chloride), bone demineralization from urinary calcium loss, nephrocalcinosis, and hearing impairment.\n1. Furosemide is a potent diuretic that reduces pulmonary blood flow and lung vascular filtration pressure and thereby decreases interstitial pulmonary edema. The usual dose is 1-2 mg/kg q12h, although every other day treatment also has been shown to improve BPD, perhaps with less likelihood of the aforementioned complications.\n2. Hydrochlorothiazide (1 mg/kg/dose q12h) and spironolactone (1-2 mg/kg/dose q12h) also may be useful, without adverse effects on urinary calcium or hearing loss. The combination (Aldactazide) has to be compounded by the pharmacy, and thus may not be available after discharge for patients who do not live near a Level III/IV NICU. These babies may need to be changed to PO Chlorothiazide 10 mg/kg/dose q12h, likely with PO Potassium Chloride supplements.\n3. Prolonged use of diuretics can cause contraction alkalosis with associated potassium and chloride depletion, usually heralded by a rising serum bicarbonate concentration and a low serum chloride concentration (sometimes in the presence of a low urine pH). Supplemental KCI (2-5 mEq/kg/d divided) or arginine HCI (if serum potassium is high) usually corrects this problem.\n\nE. Retinol (Vitamin A): Vitamin A has been found to decrease the incidence and severity of BPD in extremely premature infants that are deficient in vitamin A. For tiny infants on ventilator support, retinol is given intramuscularly at a dose of 5000 IU 3 times/wk for a total of 12 injections, which is the regimen that was used in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized control/treatment study. Vit A was unavailable due to manufacturing issues between 2010-2014, and the incidence of BPD did not increase, questioning the significance of this treatment, probably due to the marked decrease in Vitamin A deficiency.\n\nF. Glucocorticoids:\n1. Because immature infants often have very low plasma cortisol levels and do not always respond appropriately to corticotropin (ACTH), there is some evidence they may benefit from a short course (10-14 days) of hydrocortisone.\n2. Dexamethasone (Decadron) is not recommended because of its serious side effects: an increased incidence of cerebral palsy and poor neurologic outcome, perhaps related to the discovery of impaired brain growth and periventricular leukomalacia in infants who have received such therapy over a period of several days to weeks.\n3. Inhaled steroids have not been shown to be beneficial in reducing the incidence or severity of BPD.\n\n<a id='a17c3cdf-19de-4348-882d-7e4f290dc492'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

ẞ2-adrenergic agonists may be beneficial in BPD by relaxing smooth muscle constriction and also by inducing Na, K-ATPase activity in the lung epithelium, which may improve pulmonary edema.\n\n2. In unusual circumstances, aerosolized bronchodilators, such as albuterol or atrovent, may induce hypoxemia resulting from vasodilation and mismatching of ventilation/perfusion. This may occur if the underlying problem is not bronchoconstriction but rather atelectasis or mucous plugging; hence, close observation of the response to the bronchodilator treatment is very important to determine its effectiveness.\n\n3. Methylxanthines, while helpful in relieving bronchospasm in selected infants with BPD, have significant side effects, including tachycardia, seizures, and gastro-esophageal reflux, which may aggravate BPD. If these drugs are used, plasma levels must be monitored to help establish therapeutic efficacy and prevent toxicity. (See NICU Guide Section II.C.6. \"Continuous Infusion Drips Caclucation and Starting Dose\").\n\n<a id='eb9cace7-05ee-4a37-8e46-f5f703ce4653'></a>\n\nH. **Ventilation:**\n1. Over the first few weeks of life, the tidal volume of ventilated neonates increases from 4-5 mL/kg initially to 6-7 mL/kg.\n2. With the development of BPD, there can be an increase in both airways resistance and compliance resulting in \"multi-compartment lung\" pathophysiology.\n3. To manage this in intubated babies with BPD, we usually recommend a strategy involving higher tidal volumes (>6 mL/kg), longer inspiratory times (0.6-0.8 sec), and slower rates (necessary to avoid \"inverse\" I:E Ratios).\n4. This strategy must be individualized, and should be discussed with the Attending on rounds to guide the transition to, and details of, this ventilator management.\n\nI. **Inhaled Nitric Oxide (iNO):** There is considerable experimental evidence that iNO can improve respiratory gas exchange, reduce lung inflammation, improve alveolarization, and reverse pulmonary hypertension and bronchoconstriction in newborn animals with acute and chronic lung injury.\n1. Recent studies of iNO treatment in animal models of BPD have indicated that this treatment strategy may enhance alveolar development and improve lung function in both premature lambs and baboons with evolving BPD. However, clinical studies do not support the routine use of iNO in premature infants.\n2. Selection of appropriate candidates for iNO treatment, as well as timing and dosing of treatment regimens designed to prevent or reduce the severity of BPD, remain important issues for further research.\n3. Potential toxicities of iNO therapy include oxidant lung injury and loss of surfactant function from the production of peroxynitrite, interference with normal platelet function that could affect the incidence of intracranial or pulmonary hemorrhage, and long-term neurodevelopmental disability. Until more reliable information is available on efficacy and toxicity of iNO for premature infants with evolving BPD, this treatment is experimental and should not be undertaken outside of clinical trials.\n\n<a id='bebbaeaa-d0f1-44f7-9557-39fc91578fff'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Measures to treat gastro-esophageal reflux and aspiration of gastric contents:\n\n1. If suspected, an esophageal pH study should be done to test for the presence of reflux and possible apnea in order to establish the severity and frequency of the problem. Whether reflux causes BPD, or is exacerbated by it, is still under investigation.\n\n2. If significant reflux is documented, drugs that might contribute to the problem should be discontinued and anti-reflux medications should be considered.\n\nK. Assessment for vocal cord injury:\n\n1. Stridor or persistent respiratory distress may be a sign of vocal cord injury, which sometimes occurs during cardiovascular surgery, including PDA ligation.\n\n2. This condition can contribute to respiratory symptoms associated with BPD and also prolong weaning from assisted ventilation; thus, vocal cord paralysis should be considered in such situations.\n\n<a id='c15299bb-78c5-410f-b916-49fd07269df0'></a>\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

Definition\n\n1.  Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a chronic, multisystem, lethal recessive disorder that results from defective epithelial chloride transport with major manifestations in the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and reproductive systems.\n2.  The primary morbidity in CF is from progression of obstructive lung disease. A very large percentage of patients with CF have pancreatic insufficiency, which manifests as malabsorption, and insulin deficiency. Male infertility results from congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens or eventual obstruction and scarring of the vas deferens. Other less common problems encountered include cirrhosis of the liver, cholelithiasis, recurrent pancreatitis, gastroesophageal reflux, and gastrointestinal hypomotility.\n3.  The prognosis used to be quite grave and most infants and children did not survive past the age of 5 yrs. Due to the advent of supplemental enzymes to aid in food digestion and absorption, refined methods of chest physiotherapy, and antibiotics, the median survival age for individuals with CF in the U.S. is approximately 36 yrs. There is a wide variability in the severity of symptoms and the rate of decline in pulmonary function. Many patients now are living into their 40s and 50s. It is difficult to predict the life expectancy of a child born in 2017 because of the time delay of the impact of changes in therapy on life expectancy.\n\n<a id='ca601436-bc75-43a7-91b6-26e66274e977'></a>\n\n## II. Incidence\n\nA. CF is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, and both parents are usually asymptomatic carriers of the abnormal mutation. It is the most common lethal genetic disease affecting Caucasians, with an incidence of approximately 1 in 2,700 live births with a corresponding carrier frequency of 1 in 32. In the Mexican-American population, the incidence is approximately 1 in 4,500 live births. CF occurs in people of African descent, with the incidence in African-Americans at approximately 1 in 17,000 live births. The disease is extremely rare in persons of native African and of Asian descent.\n\nB. The gene that encodes for the chloride channel affected in CF is located on chromosome 7. Over 2,000 mutations have been identified to date. The gene encodes a protein of 1,480 amino acids called the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR). The most common mutation found in persons of Anglo-Saxon descent is the ΔF508 mutation, and is found in approximately 75% of patients with CF. The Δ F508 mutation is a 3 base pair deletion that results in deletion of a phenylalanine at position 508 of the protein sequence. There is a correlation between genotype and pancreatic status, but there is no correlation of specific mutations with pulmonary phenotype. Some of the CFTR mutations are associated with more severe disease expression than others, and ΔF508 is one of the mutations most commonly associated with the \"severe\" phenotype. Conversely, patients with mutations correlated with normal pancreatic function tend to have a \"milder\" CF phenotype.\n\n<a id='531a1ce3-05e1-49a5-a494-ed2e0b50bf81'></a>\n\n### III. Pathophysiology\n\nA. CF involves several organ systems, including the lungs, pancreas, intestines, hepatobiliary tract, genitourinary tract, and sweat duct. The common physiologic feature of these organs is CFTR-mediated ion transport. The exact pathophysiologic mechanism where altered ion and water transport across the epithelia of these organs is not fully described and our understanding of how CFTR dysfunction leads to organ dysfunction is a matter of much debate, but certain theories persist.\n\nB. The CF defect is characterized by a reduced ability of epithelial cells in the airways and pancreas to secrete chloride. CFTR also has a negative regulatory effect on the sodium absorption across the airway epithelium. Thus, enhanced absorption of sodium from the airway lumen and little chloride secretion into the airway leads to decreased fluid presence in the airway.

The earliest evidence of airway obstruction occurs at the level of the bronchioles with mucus plugging and inflammation consistent with bronchiolitis. Mucus plugging and inflammation extend from the bronchioles and progressively affect the larger airways over time. The pathologic features of airway abnormalities in CF include inflammatory cell infiltration of the airways, goblet cell hyperplasia, and submucosal gland hypertrophy. The CF airway is also predisposed to bacterial colonization. Chronic infection and inflammation of the airways leads to bronchiectasis and peribronchial fibrosis.\n\n<a id='30231fb4-84bf-42a2-b8e8-a5c33ca48430'></a>\n\nD. Mucociliary clearance is also greatly impaired in patients with CF. This process is manifest in most patients within the first few days of birth. Lungs fill with mucus quickly. All infants need to receive chest physiotherapy and inhale medications regularly in order to maintain good pulmonary function and minimize the rate of pulmonary deterioration over the long-term.\n\n<a id='eee4e490-e0bd-44a2-903d-e0363485fe62'></a>\n\nE. As mentioned above, patients with CF eventually become colonized with certain types of bacteria, namely Staphylococcus aureus, Hemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Colonization with S. aureus and H. influenzae is common in infants and younger children. By the age of 10, approximately 75% of children with CF are colonized by Pseudomonas.\n\n<a id='91d28c5e-bd10-463d-8c79-f0c083e87d96'></a>\n\nF. Another classic pathologic feature of the CF airway is the infiltration of inflammatory cells into the airways, even in early lung disease and in patients who are not yet colonized by bacteria. Neutrophils obtained from the respiratory secretions of CF patients of all ages are deficient in glutathione (GSH). GSH is a peptide that plays a crucial role in maintaining a balance of cellular mechanisms that regulate the oxidative effects of the inflammatory response. Neutrophil elastase appears to be a major player in the pathogenesis of cystic and bronchiectatic changes by way of constant damage to the bronchiolar and bronchial mucosa and airway structural proteins.\n\n<a id='bcac03ec-bd2d-4ece-a8b7-57367bc8e056'></a>\n\nIV. Diagnosis\n\nA. The \"Sweat Test\"\n\n1. The gold-standard test to diagnose CF is the \"sweat test\" or the pilocarpine iontophoresis test. The sweat glands of CF patients are less able to reabsorb chloride from sweat than normal people are. This leads to a very high level of chloride in the sweat and a reliable method of diagnosis. Premature infants have not developed mature sweat glands, but usually by the time a term infant is 3 wks of age, the test will be successful.\n\na. The possibility of a false positive sweat test exists. The causes include: adrenal insufficiency, ectodermal dysplasia, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, type I glycogen storage disease, anorexia nervosa, hypoparathyroidism, familial cholestatic syndromes, malnutrition and hypoalbuminemia, hypothyroidism, mucopolysaccharidoses, and fucosidosis.\n\n2. Newborn Screening for Cystic Fibrosis\n\na. Screening for cystic fibrosis at the time of birth has led to early identification of CF with a resultant positive impact on the nutritional status of young children with CF.\n\nb. Beginning in August 2007, the California legislature mandated the addition of testing for cystic fibrosis with measurement of serum immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) to the newborn screening panel.\n\ni. 4-step screening algorithm:\n\na) Serum IRT measuring \\u2265 the upper 2.2% of IRT measured on that day in newborn infants.\n\n<a id='21a0f6f5-34da-4242-8311-fdae4d825de0'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

The Pediatrician and parents will be notified of this result.\nd) If 2 mutations are positive, the baby's pediatrician and parents will be notified of the result, referral to local CF center will be facilitated, and the CF center will coordinate sweat testing.\ni. By this algorithm and the cut-off for elevated IRT, it is calculated that of the 78 new CF cases expected to occur each year, based on population demographics, that 75 will be correctly identified, giving a 96% sensitivity to the screen.\n\n<a id='9d462ee5-412d-48df-99f0-b31411c0e228'></a>\n\n### 3. Cystic Fibrosis Metabolic Syndrome\n\na. CF metabolic syndrome (CRMS) is used in the United States to describe infants with elevated levels of immunoreactive trypsinogen, sweat chloride values less than 60 mmol/L, and one to two CFTR mutations, at least one of which is not clearly categorized as CF causing. The degree of risk of developing CF among infants diagnosed with CRMS is unclear. Because of this risk, the CF Foundation recommends repeating a sweat test outside of the first 6 months of life and routine follow up in a specialized CF clinic for these infants but do not recommend interventions in the absence of symptoms suspicious for CF.\n\n<a id='892a7a7b-5ca5-4fc0-bd54-8a6da2e3112f'></a>\n\nB. **Adjunctive Testing for Newborns**\n\n1.  **Serum for CF DNA** - as stated above, in general, this is a less sensitive test than the sweat test in many populations, due to the fact that the panel of mutations that are routinely checked at the Stanford Clinical laboratory includes 24 of the most common mutations known for the Caucasian population and adds 5 more thought to be more common in the Hispanic population. This takes about 7 days to return.\n2.  **Many more mutations exist** - and it is not uncommon to receive a result that identifies only one CF mutation. This DOES NOT exclude CF from the differential. More extensive genetic analysis can be obtained from Ambry Genetics, a laboratory that sequences nearly the entire CF genome of samples. This may be requested as the initial DNA analysis for patients with different ethnic backgrounds than Northern European Caucasians. This takes about 14-21 days to return.\n3.  **Stool elastase quantification** - A small amount of stool may be obtained and sent for elastase quantification. The lower limit of normal that is selected to be the most sensitive and specific for true pancreatic exocrine insufficiency is 200 cg/gm stool.\n\n<a id='becf0e56-c331-45a7-b8c5-173b2953ecd1'></a>\n\n<::This is a flowchart illustrating a screening process for Cystic Fibrosis (CF).\n\n1.

The \"CFTR mutation analysis\" is another decision point:\n    *   If \"No mutations\" are found, it leads to \"Low risk of CF. No further tests. No results reported by screening lab.\"\n    *   If \"1 mutation\" is found, it leads to \"Perform sweat test.\"\n    *   If \"2 mutations\" are found, it leads to \"CF confirmed.\"\n: flowchart::>\n\n<a id='55c7865e-0b29-4409-95b4-c69d7a2952d8'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

This is a surgical emergency and may result in intestinal perforation. In the instance of intestinal perforation, an ileostomy and ileal resection are often necessary.\n\nB. **The most common clinical manifestation for infants with CF is respiratory.** Infants frequently present with recurrent episodes of wheezing and respiratory distress (bronchiolitis) and pneumonia. Interestingly, the RUL is the most commonly affected lobe initially. Infants and children may also suffer from atelectasis or pneumothorax and respiratory failure can easily occur in infants with severe inflammation and infection.\n\nC. **The pathophysiology for most of the other organs affected in CF is similar to that of the lungs.** Therefore, in most patients born with CF, the pancreas is severely affected. At the time of birth, the pancreatic ducts are obstructed with inspissated secretions. The ducts and acini are dilated and eventually form cystic changes. Fibrosis ensues as the organ slowly proceeds to autolyse over time. This results in decreased secretion of digestive enzymes into the intestine, and contributes to malabsorption and steatorrhea, classic signs of pancreatic dysfunction. At a critical point, the pancreas is sufficiently damaged such that the CF patient becomes deficient in insulin production and glucose intolerance and diabetes ensue.\n\n<a id='26ed191b-4cf2-42d3-8185-256a88fcf19c'></a>\n\nVI. Management\n\nA. The management of CF can be very complicated due to multi-system involvement and a high frequency of complications. For these reasons, a comprehensive and intensive therapy program is essential. Outpatients are seen at intervals of 2-3 mos by a physician experienced in CF and its manifestations. The CF \"Team\" approach is most beneficial for the patients, and includes Nursing, Nutrition, Physical therapy, Respiratory Therapy, and Social work.\n\nB. Pulmonary Treatment of CF begins early and occurs on a daily basis. While newborn infants with CF may appear asymptomatic from a respiratory standpoint, inflammatory processes are initiated immediately upon delivery. The primary goal is to focus on clearance of excess mucus from the tracheobronchial tree. Initial treatment should include inhalation of a β2-agonist followed by manual percussion and postural drainage. Infants born with meconium ileus are known to develop more severe obstruction earlier in life than CF patients who do not have meconium ileus at birth. Thus, these infants with a more \"severe\" presentation would benefit from a more aggressive pulmonary toilet regimen to include the use of anti-inflammatory treatment, though there is no strict protocol for treatment. Patients and families should be educated on the importance of daily assisted mucus clearance.\n\nC. Antibiotics\n\n1. Treatment is generally reserved for acute exacerbations. When possible, antibiotic therapy is guided by the patient's most recent sputum or throat culture. Long- term data obtained from throat cultures of younger children demonstrate that most tend to be colonized with Staphylococcus aureus and/or Hemophilus influenza. As children become older, Pseudomonas aeruginosa throat colonization becomes more prominent, and growth of S. aureus and H. influenza tend to resolve by the teen yrs.\n\n2. If a patient requires hospitalization for CF pneumonia, when treating a gram-negative, lactose non-fermenting bacillus such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, double antibiotic therapy is utilized in order to achieve a synergistic bactericidal effect. The most common antibiotic regimens utilize an aminoglycoside such as tobramycin combined with a third-generation semisynthetic penicillin or a cephalosporin that has adequate anti-pseudomonal activity (ceftazidime or cefepime).\n\n3. CF patients require very high doses of most medications to achieve therapeutic serum levels. Aminoglycosides bind covalently to the DNA that is abundant in the CF airway, and the volume of distribution of the drug is increased. In particular, in the absence of renal dysfunction, aminoglycoside\n\n<a id='112112cd-a729-40a6-a8dc-1441077f6da1'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Pre-dose serum levels must be assessed to assure the least toxicity to the patient, but post-dose levels are generally sought to be at least 9 mg/dL but not more than 13 mg/mL.\n\n<a id='f852ae6a-888a-412c-8624-7894fa2e4c17'></a>\n\nD. **Corticosteroid Therapy**\n\nAdditions to the CF pharmaceutical regime intended to diminish the chronic inflammation of the airways include corticosteroid therapy and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication.\n\n<a id='f3d4419d-461d-4d3e-97eb-bacd505ac66f'></a>\n\n### E. Recombinant Human DNase (rhDNase)\n\nThe sputum in CF is more abundant and has increased viscosity because of increased glycoprotein sulfation and DNA released from dead neutrophils present in high concentration in the airways. Newborn infants may experience episodes of mucus plugging and/or atelectasis, particularly those who are sedated and mechanically intubated. The dose is one vial per nebulization; it comes in a concentration of 2.5 mg/2.5 mL. The usual frequency of use is once a day, though for patients with atelectasis, twice a day.\n\n<a id='146ee895-ddc0-45b7-9912-afe7cf788512'></a>\n\nF. **Hypertonic Saline nebulization (7% solution)**\n\nThis treatment is a relatively recent addition to the potential regimen for CF patients to maintain airways clearance. In randomized, placebo-controlled trials, it has been demonstrated that subjects had fewer episodes of pulmonary exacerbation requiring IV antibiotic use and fewer hospitalizations. In infants, however, this advantage was not proved, nor was there any benefit seen in maintenance of lung function compared to placebo. It is becoming standard of care in most CF regimens for children 5 years and older.\n\n<a id='93d57342-8a9d-484b-99f1-dee12ead5539'></a>\n\nG. Gastrointestinal\n\n1. GI symptoms are typical for patients with CF, but treatment with oral pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy is often all that is needed to improve and maintain adequate nutritional status and minimize malabsorption, steatorrhea, constipation, and diarrhea.\n\n2. Pancreatic enzymes are obtained primarily from porcine pancreas and available in powder or capsule form. The amount of enzyme dosage per capsule varies. The dose of enzyme given is based on the patient's weight, and most patients are maintained on doses of 500-5000 lipase units/kg/meal. The capsules contain small microencapsulated enzymes, which are protected from acid digestion in the stomach, and are most active in the duodenum and ileum, where the pH is alkaline. Since the patients who require enzyme replacement therapy are, by definition, pancreatic insufficient, they may require concomitant doses of antacid to maximize the activity of the pancreatic enzyme in the small intestine.\n\n2. For infants, the capsule is opened, and the tiny beads are either poured directly into the infants mouth, or the beads or placed in the tip of a nipple and \"dissolved\" in a tiny bit of formula. Enzymes are administered orally immediately before each meal. The infant first takes this, then is given the bottle of formula or breast-fed. Sometimes, the powdered form is added to the formula, but this leads to immediate curdling of the formula and seems to make the formula taste bad. Many infants reject this.\n\n<a id='450c02e4-21d7-40e2-a03c-1658eeb149a4'></a>\n\nH. **CFTR Protein Correctors and Potentiators**\n\n1. Several classes of dysfunction related to CFTR gene mutations have been described.\n\n**Class I** – Defective protein production. This defect is usually caused by nonsense, frameshift, or splice-site mutations and leads to absence of protein production.\n\n<a id='bb2241a4-fbe0-4c39-a9cb-365358734ea3'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

This causes abnormal post-translational processing of the CFTR protein trafficking to the correct cellular location. Delta F508 mutation is the most representative of this class, as it is degraded in the Golgi complex.\n\n**Class III** - Defective regulation. These lead to diminished channel activity in response to ATP. The G551D mutation is the most common mutation that causes this type of dysfunction.\n\n<a id='a13329a5-0062-48de-8aba-ec6adffa144e'></a>\n\nClass IV – Defective conduction – the protein is correctly localized to the apical surface of the cell, but the channel opening and conductance of chloride through the channel is decreased and not easily activated.\n\n<a id='e0a54b63-3534-4854-9eac-447549a5dba5'></a>\n\n**Class V** – Reduced amounts of functional CFTR protein.\n\n<a id='9abee26b-5d82-4109-b5ec-08c36af99ecb'></a>\n\nClass VI – Altered stability of the mature CFTR protein in the cell membrane.\n\n<a id='02fe7450-cd39-4174-8f53-376e4a605c5d'></a>\n\n2. While there is no drug developed yet that targets the most common mutations, there has been development of an oral pharmaceutical (Ivacaftor) that is able to correct the function of CFTR protein that has the G551D mutation, and leads to normal CFTR protein function as evidenced by normalization of the sweat chloride conductance in the chloride iontophoresis test, as well as marked improvement and normalization of lung function abnormalities. The drug treatment accounts for 4% of the total CF population. Other gene mutations for which ivacaftor (KALYDECO®) has been approved as of March 18, 2015 for use in children ages 2 and older with cystic fibrosis (CF) who have one of 10 mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene (G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N, S549R and R117H).\n\n<a id='39b80e4b-a20e-4021-a1b3-714c1885f6d4'></a>\n\n3. Orkambi is another product approved for use in CF patients who are homozygous for the F508del mutation, which comprises approximately 50% of the CF population. The F508del mutation interferes with CFTR protein folding and channel gating activity. Lumacaftor (VX-809) partially corrects the CFTR misfolding while ivacaftor improves the gating abnormality. Unfortunately, neither drug is effective when used alone for F508del homozygotes. Combination therapy with lumacaftor-ivacaftor decreased sweat chloride concentration in a phase 2 trial, and was then evaluated in two similarly designed clinical trials (TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT trials), reported in a combined analysis. Dosing is as follows:\n\n<a id='286d3ea8-5592-4c04-85b7-de71beec1fb4'></a>\n\na. Patients six years and older - Two tablets (each containing lumacaftor 200 mg-ivacaftor 125 mg) taken orally every 12 hours. Lumacaftor-ivacaftor should be taken with fat-containing foods.\nb. It has not yet been approved for younger children with CF. Safety and efficacy trials are ongoing.\n\n<a id='024d656b-ad6d-4fcf-bcf0-27411fe24320'></a>\n\n4. Intensive research is being conducted for other compounds that can affect CFTR function and clinical trials are currently under way.\n\n<a id='3bb63b2c-6822-48f6-99a1-c1dfc264598e'></a>\n\nVII. **Complications**\n\nA. In the newborn, the most frequent and serious complication is that of meconium ileus with intestinal perforation.\n\nB. Older children and adults can suffer other types of complications that are a result of the scarring and fibrosis that occurs in the lungs, liver, and pancreas.\n\n1. **Hemoptysis**: Patients often experience blood streaking of their sputum. This is probably due to rupture of surface capillaries secondary to vigorous coughing. A larger danger exists if bleeding occurs due to erosion of bronchial arteries into a bronchus. This most often occurs in association with a pulmonary exacerbation. It occurs in <10% of adults and rarely in children and it is estimated that 1% of all patients die from massive hemoptysis.\n2. **Pneumothorax** occurs in 8-23% of older CF patients but can occur in children with severe disease. The mortality rate is about 4% if pneumothorax occurs and the median survival after pneumothorax occurs is\n\n<a id='8349d865-25cd-42c4-ab98-46a425488ddb'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Recurrent pancreatitis: Interestingly, this occurs more commonly in the small subset of CF patients who are pancreatic sufficient. The reasons for this are not yet understood.\n4. Intussusception: There is an increased incidence of intussusception in children with CF. It is thought that he bulky, inspissated intestinal contents typical of CF patients acts as the \"lead point\" for the intussusception.\n\n<a id='043e86fe-b659-43db-a26f-87dad1910099'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

One of the disadvantages is that that amount of medication delivered to the patient is estimated to be 10%. Particle size may vary depending on the type of nebulizer used. Treatment time can last up to 20 min. Patients on mechanical ventilation may require adjustments in their ventilator settings during the treatment.\n2.  **Ordering:** by milligram or strength of solution (e.g., Albuterol 2.5 mg every 4 hrs).\n\nB. **Metered Dose Inhalers (MDI):**\n\n1.  **Use:** MDIs are given to neonates using mask and spacer or in-line for ventilated patients. The advantages are portability, efficient drug delivery, and short preparation time. For ventilated patients, ventilator settings do not have to be altered during treatment delivery. The disadvantages are fixed drug concentrations, limited choice of drugs, possible reaction to the propellants, and oropharyngeal deposition.\n2.  **Ordering:** These medications are ordered by the \"puff.\" For ventilated patients the dose should be increased, as medication impacts on the endotracheal tube (ETT).\n\n<a id='2dbda1c4-db61-4597-912a-5d4278dfe9b0'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Respiratory Care Medications Administered by Inhalation\n\n<a id='53bf18f5-152d-4fdc-b3a4-03919f455262'></a>\n\nA. Anticholinergics (parasympatholytic) Bronchodilators\n\nThe potential for bronchodilation by parasympatholytic agents is based on the premise that the parasympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system maintains a basal tone in bronchial smooth muscle and possibly exerts an abnormally active role in hyper-reactive airway diseases such as asthma. To the extent that the parasympathetic branch causes airway constriction in disease, agents that block parasympathetic receptors will prevent bronchoconstriction.\n\n1. Ipratropium Bromide (Atrovent®):\n\ta. Use: Ipratropium bromide is an anticholinergic agent that has a local, site-specific effect, not a systemic one. It is indicated for the treatment of the bronchospastic symptoms. It is often used in conjunction with other bronchodilators, especially beta adrenergics, and prevents bronchoconstriction. Ipratropium bromide has been demonstrated to exert its effects primarily on the more central airways. It may be useful for decreasing secretion in the central airways.\n\ti. How supplied:\n\t\ta) Ipratropium MDI: CFC free 17 mcg/inh\n\n\t\tDose: The pediatric (<12 yrs old) dose is 2 puffs given every 4-6 hrs, the total 24-hr dose should not exceed 12 puffs or 0.24 mg. Insufficient clinical data exist with respect to dosage for patients <12 yrs old.\n\n\t\tb) Ipratropium bromide 0.02% solution: 500 mcg in 2.5 ml normal saline unit dose\n\n\t\tDose: The adult dose is 500 mcg (1 unit dose vial) administered 3-4 times per day by oral nebulization, with doses 6-8 hrs apart. Safety, efficacy, and dose in children <12 yrs has not been established. Various dosages have been described in the literature.\n\n<a id='eeaafe2a-8182-4171-b3b4-2e3a785cadfb'></a>\n\nB. Alpha and Beta Adrenergic stimulation\n\n1.  Racemic epinephrine (Vaponefrin®, Micronefrin):\n\n    i.  **Use:** In contrast to other sympathomimetics, racemic epinephrine is administered for its effect on the adrenergic alpha receptors, which cause vasoconstriction and decongestion in the nose and upper airway, reducing some airway edema. Racemic epinephrine is used to increase the caliber of an edematous airway, specifically for croup, and post-extubation stridor. Regular use is not recommended.\n\n<a id='14960ffd-644f-4751-93d7-16b7b16a501f'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Sympathomimetic Bronchodilators\n\n1. Use: Sympathomimetic bronchodilators act by stimulating the beta-2 receptors of the sympathetic nervous system to increase the concentration of cyclic AMP, causing bronchial smooth muscle relaxation. These agents are indicated for patients with lung disease who have a reversible airway obstruction. Since these agents can also increase both cardiac contraction and rate, the patient's HR must be monitored before, during, and after these agents are given. Children who do not have heart disease may be treated with bronchodilators at HR up to 200 bpm. In children with heart disease or HR bpm >200 bpm, use with caution. All orders must include pulse range restrictions. Generally, doses should be adjusted to patient response, and administered when patient is symptomatic. Albuterol does not prevent bronchospasm; it reverses it. An alternative is to use levalbuterol, which is the L-isomer of albuterol.\n\n<a id='a52fd3bc-49a3-4c5b-a6bf-bc6fdee0f25f'></a>\n\na. **Albuterol (Proventil®, Ventolin®)**\n\nAlbuterol has very little beta-1 adrenergic effect and can be utilized in relatively large doses at frequent intervals.\n\ni. **How supplied:**\n\na) Albuterol solution 0.5%: 5 mg/ml (average treatment-2.5 mg every 4 hrs).\n\n   **Dilute:** 0.1-0.5 ml every 4-6 hrs prn in 2 ml dilution.\n\nb) Pre-mixed (0.083%): 0.5-1 unit dose neb every 4-6 hrs prn\n\nc) Albuterol MDI: CFC free 90 mcg/inh\n\n   **Dose:** 1-2 inhalations 4 times/day.\n\n<a id='996c79d3-9e63-43e8-a237-cbd01b15d666'></a>\n\nb. **Levalbuterol (Xopenex®)**\n\nLittle to no beta-1 adrenergic effect.\n\ni. **How supplied:** (0.31mg/3ml), (0.63/3ml) and (1.25mg/3ml).\n\n**Dose:** Give 1 unit dose no more than every 6 hrs. Generally, every 8 hrs is sufficient for stable patients.\n\n<a id='fcbf5105-3232-4a5e-b23c-fa3d0f614e36'></a>\n\nD. Corticosteroids\n\nThe primary purposes of inhaled corticosteroids are to treat asthma through the anti-inflammatory effect and to reduce tracheal inflammation. Inhaled corticosteroids have greater effect topically and less effect systemically. Controlled clinical studies have shown that orally inhaled and intranasal corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity in pediatric patients. In studies of orally-inhaled corticosteroids, the mean reduction in growth velocity was approximately 1 cm/yr (range 0.3-1.8 cm/yr) and appears to be related to dose and duration of exposure. To minimize the systemic effects of orally inhaled and intranasal corticosteroids, each patient should be titrated to the lowest effective dose.\n\n<a id='66e0c2fa-96db-4496-9910-8001e9bb828c'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

May be systemically absorbed in high doses.\n\ni. **How supplied**: Beclomethasone MDI, 80 mcg/inh\n\n**Dose**: Children (6-12) 1-2 inhalations 3-4/day. The maximum dose should not exceed 10 inhalations, 400 mcg, in 24 hrs.\n\n<a id='9be2798d-cc03-4329-a111-ff88860d9845'></a>\n\n3. **Budesonide (Pulmicort®):**\n\na. **Use:** Has anti-inflammatory effects, reduces airway edema, hyperreactivity, and may reduce need for bronchodilator.\n\ni. **How supplied:** Available as nebulized solution (0.25 mg/2 ml and 0.5 mg/2 ml) or DPI (90 mcg/inh, 180 mcg/inh).\n\n**Dose:** Neb 0.5-1 unit dose neb daily or Q12hrs, and DPI is 1-2 puffs daily or Q12hrs.\n\n<a id='7885797d-ec4a-40ad-8234-805ba9a27add'></a>\n\nE. Mucolytics\n\n1.  Acetylcysteine (Mucomyst®, Mucosil®)\n\n    a.  **Use:** Acetylcysteine contains a free sulfhydryl group that breaks down the disulfide bonds of mucoid sputum. Acetylcysteine may be helpful in lung diseases characterized by viscid mucus retention. Since acetylcysteine can provoke severe bronchospasm, we recommend a bronchodilator be administered concurrently.\n\n        i.  **How supplied:**\n\n            a)  Acetylcysteine 10%: 100 mg/mL.\n            b)  Acetylcysteine 20%: 200 mg/mL.\n\n    **Dose:** Infants - 2 ml of 5% solution 2-4/day.\n\n2.  Dornase Alpha, rhDNase (Pulmozyme®)\n\n<a id='3a0b71b3-318a-46dc-b1d4-0fd782fb134c'></a>\n\na. **Use:** Pulmozyme® hydrolyzes the DNA in sputum of cystic fibrosis patients and reduces sputum viscoelasticity. This is useful in patients who have infectious pulmonary processes to liberate purulent secretions. DNase greatly reduces the viscosity of purulent cystic fibrosis sputum, decreases the adhesiveness of cystic fibrosis sputum, and augments mucociliary clearance.\n\n<a id='4c45a881-e43b-4d5a-a242-088408453dce'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Inhaled Antibiotics\n\n1. Tobramycin (TOBI)\n\na. Use: Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside that inhibits cell wall synthesis of gram-negative organisms. It is used primarily for patients with cystic fibrosis, but can be used effectively and with a minimum of systemic absorption to avoid renal toxicity for patients with tracheostomies who have symptoms of tracheitis or bronchitis due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa or other gram-negative species sensitive to tobramycin.\n\ni. How supplied: 300 mg/5 mL, preservative-free.\n\nDose: one vial nebulized Q12.\n\n<a id='8cbdebad-36b6-490a-b242-cdafc0a48839'></a>\n\n2. Aztreonam (Cayston)\n\na. **Use:** aztreonam is a synthetic monocyclic b-lactam that inhibits cell wall synthesis of gram-negative organisms. It is used primarily for patients with cystic fibrosis, but can be used effectively and with a minimum of systemic absorption to avoid renal toxicity for patients with tracheostomies who have symptoms of tracheitis or bronchitis due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa or other gram-negative species sensitive to tobramycin.\n\ni. **How supplied:** 75 mg/2 mL, preservative free\n\n**Dose:** one vial nebulized TID for 28-day cycles, given every other month\n\n<a id='e06e31f5-da8c-4703-8436-296902d85eb5'></a>\n\n3. Colistimethate (Colistin)\n\na. Use: colistimethate is a polycationic and has both hydrophilic and lipophilic moieties. These poly-cationic regions interact with the bacterial outer membrane, by displacing bacterial counter ions in the lipopolysaccharide. Hydrophobic/hydrophillic regions interact with the cytoplasmic membrane just like a detergent, solubilizing the membrane in an aqueous environment. This effect is bactericidal even in an isosmolaric environment. It is used primarily for patients with cystic fibrosis, but can be used effectively and with a minimum of systemic absorption to avoid renal toxicity for patients with tracheostomies who have symptoms of tracheitis or bronchitis due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa or generally other other gram-negative species resistant to tobramycin and other antibiotics.\n\n<a id='b33469c0-8206-40da-a44c-66161952bf0d'></a>\n\ni. **How supplied**: 150 mg/2 mL, preservative free\n\n**Dose**: one vial nebulized BID for 28-day cycles, given every other month\n\n<a id='290c90e3-c8b1-4206-9a60-ef91f8d03029'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Patients with low cardiac output or congestive heart failure may have peripheral vasoconstriction caused by increased circulating catecholamines.\n2. Neonates with left heart obstructive lesions become symtomatic when the PDA begins to close. Once this occurs, there is decreased systemic perfusion that leads to the development of metabolic acidosis, which further compromises cardiac function.\n3. Infants with low cardiac output usually have weak pulses; however, those with systemic artery-to-pulmonary artery connections may have bounding pulses despite decreased systemic blood flow. Those infants with weak pulses or absent pulses in the lower extremities may have an interrupted aortic arch or coarctation.\n\nD. **Liver**:\nUsually found at 1-2 fingers width below the right costal margin. If lower than that, one must consider congestive heart failure.\n\nE. **Respiratory Pattern**:\nInfants with CHD may present with signs of respiratory distress, especially in cases of pulmonary overcirculation or with defects leading to metabolic acidosis.\n\nF. **Dysmorphic Features**:\n1. Unusual features possibly related to a genetic syndrome should prompt a Genetics consult and chromosome analysis. See Appendix A: Genetic Testing Algorithm for Complex CHD Patients.\n2. If the heart lesion is a conotruncal heart malformation (e.g., truncus arteriosus, Tetralogy of Fallot, interrupted aortic arch type B, conoventricular septal defects), a microdeletion of chromosome 22, otherwise known as DiGeorge syndrome or velocardiofacial syndrome (VCF), may be present. FISH for 22q11 deletion should be ordered as part of the chromosomal work up. If 22q11 deletion is diagnosed, further endocrine/immunologic work-up is indicated (See NICU Guide Section II.J. \"[22q11 Deletion Syndrome](https://example.com/22q11_Deletion_Syndrome)\").\n3. Chromosomal anomalies causing both cardiac and non-cardiac defects also include Trisomy 13, Trisomy 18, Trisomy 21, and Monosomy X (Turner syndrome). Cardiac defects are also seen with VACTERL and CHARGE.\n\n<a id='afd66309-e76b-4967-be26-a6eb8538e43c'></a>\n\nG. Heart Auscultation:\n\n1. Soft systolic murmurs heard at the right lower sternal border are often tricuspid regurgitation that may be consistent with transient neonatal myocardial ischemia (possibly related to a history of a difficult delivery).\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.
