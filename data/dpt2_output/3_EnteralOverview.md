## SELF-ASSESSMENT

SP is a 69-year-old man with a newly placed PEG tube after laryngeal cancer resection. The physician would like you to make recommendations for enteral nutrition management. Which recommendation would be MOST appropriate in this patient?

A. Placement of a nasojejunal feeding tube because of aspiration risk
B. Initiation of intermittent bolus feeding via the PEG tube
C. Conversion of the PEG to a G-J tube for continuous postpyloric feeding
D. Make patient NPO and start parenteral nutrition

GASTRIC OR JEJUNAL FEEDS?

*   Gastric Feeding:
    *   Can bolus feed if G-tube (lower esophageal sphincter intact - NG stents sphincter open)
    *   Larger bore tubes usually accept crushed meds

*   Jejunal Feeding:
    *   Continuous feeds are the standard
    *   Require home pump
    *   Smaller diameter, harder to replace tubes
    *   Minimize medication administration due to clogging, absorption, and pH
    *   NO CRUSHED MEDS

* Depends on institutional comfort / experience with placing postpyloric tubes
* Some consider postpyloric to be standard for most patients
* Give stronger consideration to postpyloric feeding in patients with:
  - Known aspiration risk / history
  - Altered mental status, altered swallowing
  - Delayed gastric emptying / gastroparesis (known or suspected)
  - Repeatedly elevated gastric residuals (if these are being checked)
  - Acute pancreatitis

# SELECTING PERCUTANEOUS ACCESS: PROS AND CONS

*   Greatest advantages PEG and other percutaneous tubes:
    *   Avoid patient discomfort associated with naso- or oroenteral tubes
    *   May remain in place for extended periods
    *   Can be easily concealed, contributing to less patient stigma
    *   Facilitates intermittent use
*   Greatest disadvantages of PEG and other percutaneous tubes:
    *   Complications may be severe
    *   Tube clogging is a major problem
    *   Leakage around the tube site
    *   Tube breakage, especially in areas of mechanical stress
    *   Tube may be hard to replace

: illustration::>

<a id='bb457da3-2854-47c7-b7af-34a618d76b92'></a>

* G-tubes are strongly preferred over J-tubes
* G-tubes are larger, easier to maintain, more durable, less prone to dislodgement. G-tube permits bolus feeding
* J-tube typically requires open surgery or much more complex / difficult endoscopic placement technique. Neither is usually done. Replacement usually requires fluoroscopic assistance. Tubes / tracts are not as durable
* J-tubes typically reserved for patients with:
  - Failed gastric feeding
  - Planned gastric surgery
