## Introduction

Pediatric intestinal failure is the reduction of functional intestinal mass below that which can sustain life, resulting in dependence on supplemental parenteral support for a minimum of 60 days within a 74-consecutive-day interval.¹ The most common cause of intestinal failure in children is short bowel syndrome (SBS). SBS is defined as less than 25% of the small bowel length predicted for gestational age (GA) or dependence on parenteral nutrition for more than 6 weeks after bowel resection.² Causes of SBS include necrotizing enterocolitis, congenital atresia, volvulus, gastroschisis, or inflammatory bowel disease. The primary goal of management of SBS is to attain enteral autonomy. Management includes maintaining proper growth and development until patients can attain enteral autonomy.³ This can be achieved by supplementation of adequate nutrients, electrolytes, vitamins, and minerals and by providing substrate to the intestine to maintain intestinal health and promote intestinal adaptation. In this chapter, we will be reviewing the nutrition management of patients with SBS.

Assessment and Nutrient Requirements

<a id='92c83c14-ee6b-4c70-a1cd-e68eb776d8c4'></a>

Nutrition rehabilitation is key to promoting adaptation in children with SBS. Children with SBS are at risk for intolerance of enteral nutrition (EN), and a complete and thorough history and assessment is required to optimize their clinical status.

<a id='4abdb485-4b52-4af1-a2f6-49913734b26a'></a>

* History: Evaluation of intake (oral nutrition, EN, parenteral nutrition [PN]) and evaluation of output (stool output, ostomy output if [applicable], gastrostomy output)
* Physical exam: Anthropometrics (height/length, weight, weight for age, body mass index) and a nutrition-focused physical examination
* Laboratory assessment: Table 24-1 outlines the laboratory monitoring in patients with SBS.

In addition to these, the prothrombin time/partial thromboplastin time, copper, zinc, selenium, chromium, triene/tetraene ratio, and manganese can be monitored as indicated.⁴ Urine sodium should be checked in patients with high ostomy output and poor growth. Goal should be to maintain level more than 20 mEq/L.⁴

<a id='b759ae66-442b-432f-86bc-27a3ba79222a'></a>

## Implementation of Nutrition Plan and Monitoring

Maximizing enteral/oral feeds and lowering dependence on PN should be the goal of management in children with SBS. To do this, many factors need to be considered when implementing and monitoring the nutrition care plan for children with SBS.

<a id='3453147f-3e5c-4d35-87d3-68fc0f116bda'></a>

**Nutrition Prescription**

Daily energy intake of infants with SBS is most often higher than 100–140 kcal/kg because of poor nutrient absorption. Daily fluid requirements for infants can be as high as 150–200 mL/kg/d and older children may also have increased nutrient and fluid requirements.

<a id='07bee27c-0db2-4420-9eca-0efc703565ef'></a>

The total energy needs are ultimately guided by gain in weight and length. PN energy needs are less likely to be increased because there is no thermic energy associated with digestion of food. PN fluid needs may be increased as per the stool or ostomy output.³

<a id='e2577d98-b129-4610-b3f0-637e8e40faa2'></a>

_Enteral Nutrition_

EN should be started as soon as clinically appropriate after a resection. At the very least, minimal or trophic feeds are encouraged to maintain mucosal health. Oral feeds, in small volumes, should be encouraged to maintain oral skills.

<a id='0addf6eb-6f6d-4b7c-addb-9a94f077ac7f'></a>

Human milk is recommended in infants because it contains immunoglobulins, prebiotics, and growth factors, which help in intestinal adaptation. Donor breast milk can be used for preterm infants under 32 weeks' GA. If human milk is not available, formulas can be used. Amino acid-based formulas or extensively hydrolyzed formulas are

<a id='e0802a12-1ba6-4b48-bdf9-1ea447ed4916'></a>

preferred because children with SBS absorb nutrients better if they are broken down.²

<a id='72e58572-053e-4995-92d8-c9bf2a4cb7e0'></a>

## Mode of Feeds

Feeds can be given as continuous, bolus, or a combination of both. Bolus feeds mimic physiologic feeds and should be trialed in low volumes. If not well tolerated, continuous feeds can be tried. An approach employing both bolus and continuous feeds (eg, continuous feeds overnight and bolus feeds through the day) can be used to gain the benefits of both.3

<a id='fc13cd1b-bd09-4b09-97d1-92151a127bc2'></a>

_**Advancement of Enteral Nutrition**_

The volume of enteral feeds should be increased slowly to allow the intestine to adapt. Monitoring of the stool output, stool consistency, tolerance of feeds, and growth should guide this decision. Stool output should be maintained at around less than 40 mL/kg/d or at a less than 50% increase from baseline.3 As enteral feeds are advanced, PN should be weaned accordingly to maintain total energy needs.

<a id='b2568557-b1d0-4e93-bfc9-2532e8f41f88'></a>

Solids can be introduced at 4–6 months of age.² New foods should be introduced after 3–5 days to allow for assessment of tolerance. Fiber in the form of pectin, pureed green beans, and guar gum leads to the production of short-chain fatty acids in the colon that in turn can facilitate water absorption and help with stool losses.

* Pectin should be 3% of feed volume.
* Pureed green beans should be provided at 4 oz per 8-oz formula, bringing the 30-kcal/oz formula down to 22 kcal/oz.
* Guar gum should be provided at 20 g/L.

<a id='052f9f9e-edf6-4459-8b1f-3316021a1f10'></a>

There are some data indicating that patients older than 1 year of age can benefit from food-based formulas. However, they may need closer monitoring of their growth and micronutrient adequacy.² A high-fat diet is preferred because it has a high energy content and promotes intestinal adaptation. Long-chain triglycerides (LCTs) are helpful for intestinal adaptation but require micelle formation, without which they are not absorbed well in the small intestine. Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs)

<a id='60ae6715-c824-4331-a549-adca4523ea8d'></a>

are absorbed better, do not require micelle formation, and bypass the
need for lymphatic continuity. The optimal source of fat is usually a
combination of MCTs and LCTS.3

<a id='41977b58-180c-40e2-b594-7b7ad52c3f3c'></a>

Limiting simple sugars like juices and fruits is a general rule because of osmotic diarrhea. Complex carbohydrates have a lower osmotic load

<a id='7b79f25f-8630-4468-ad5c-b7fd476cd4e1'></a>

and are better tolerated.³ See Table 24-2 for a list of simple and complex
carbohydrates.

_Parenteral Nutrition_
PN is needed to support the partial or complete energy needs of patients with SBS until they achieve enteral autonomy.

<a id='eb8437d8-e421-4a78-b4f0-3e01220336bf'></a>

• Blended lipid injectable emulsions (ILEs; eg, soy, MCT, olive, fish oil-based ILEs) are preferred over the traditional soy oil-based ILE because of a lower risk of cholestasis and intestinal failure-associated liver disease (IFALD).
• Iron is not compatible with 3-in-1 PN preparations and needs to be given either orally/enterally or via intravenous iron infusions.
• Multivitamin and micronutrient additives are available based on the age and weight of the patient. (See chapter 6, "Parenteral Nutrition," for more details on specific products.)

<a id='97fd14df-6f6f-4ac3-bb5e-2c2ea7c315d7'></a>

PN can be started over 24 hours, but “cycling,” which is the process of
building in time off PN during every 24-hour cycle, should be attempted
once fluid status is stable. Cycling decreases the risk of IFALD, is more
physiologic, and is easier for family functioning. Attempts to decrease
PN and maximize dependence on EN should be the goal, which is guided
by enteral tolerance, stool output, and growth of the patient. PN in infants
with SBS increases the risk of IFALD. Frequently, patients can be
weaned off PN but continue to need parenteral fluids for hydration and
electrolyte imbalance.

<a id='96fa7923-0080-4ae8-b7d5-d4cbdd96541a'></a>

During the transition period from PN to EN and after successful
transition, patients are at risk of key micronutrient, vitamin, and mineral
deficiencies. The most common deficiencies are of iron, copper, and fat-
soluble vitamins. Other reported micronutrient deficiencies include those
of vitamin A, D, E, B12, and zinc. Hence, there is a need for aggressive
laboratory monitoring in patients during weaning from PN and the
transition to EN even if they are growing well.5

# Introduction

Childhood obesity continues to be an ongoing health problem affecting the United States, with 1 out of 5 children having obesity.¹ Children and adolescents with obesity are more likely to have obesity as adults and are more at risk for what we have traditionally thought of as adult health problems, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and orthopedic issues.²⁻⁵ In addition, children and adolescents who have obesity experience psychosocial problems including depression, low self-esteem, and suicidal ideation because of being bullied for their weight.³,⁵,⁶

<a id='49f11552-cac7-4d20-bc27-89a803333711'></a>

# Assessment and Nutrient Requirements

Anthropometrics should be assessed including height, weight, and body mass index (BMI). BMI is a method of assessing a person's body fat and the most common measure used to define obesity in children and adolescents. Although it is not a direct measurement of body fat, BMI for age correlates reasonably well with measurements of more direct methods.7,8 BMI is calculated by using the following equations:

<a id='39c31ce1-10cc-41eb-b4cf-217b6898aea6'></a>

BMI = (weight in kilograms/height in centimeters squared) × 10,000

<a id='c16707b4-481d-4fd6-9843-9a04797d6b7e'></a>

BMI = (weight in pounds/height in inches squared) × 703

<a id='b93f8680-d127-4d6e-8a48-35d0152273c7'></a>

Anthropometrics including height, weight, and BMI are plotted on age- and sex-specific growth charts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.⁹ The Expert Committee recommends using the following cutoffs for children 2–20 years of age²:
* Overweight: BMI between 85th and 94th percentile
* Obesity: BMI greater than or equal to the 95th percentile
* Severe obesity: BMI greater than the 99th percentile

<a id='d4af1a4c-fd97-4106-b72c-e8a3380408cc'></a>

A more specific classification divides obesity into 3 classes$^{10,11}$:
* Class I obesity: greater than or equal to the 95th percentile
* Class II obesity: greater than or equal to 120% of the 95th percentile
* Class III obesity: greater than or equal to 140% of the 95th percentile

If a child has obesity, further evaluation is needed and should include a history assessment (Exhibit 25-1) and a physical examination (Exhibit 25-2).$^{2,12,13}$

<a id='29182a3e-45ca-407d-bdfb-dd58211d43a5'></a>

## EXHIBIT 25-1. History Assessment

*Weight History*: Review the child's rate of weight gain and age at onset of obesity.

<a id='ffa4e8c4-711d-4f8a-a100-1c7efebc89c1'></a>

Diet History: This information helps to identify targets for change and should include information about eating patterns (timing, quality, location of meals/snacks), frequency of foods higher in calories and low in nutrition value (meals outside of home, sugar-containing drinks, snack foods like chips/cookies), and food preferences/dislikes. Energy intake/dietary patterns can be assessed using a combination of methods including 24-h recalls, food records, and food frequency questionnaires.a

<a id='8911a53d-dd4c-4b49-9721-905025f1a75f'></a>

Activity: Evaluate child's level of activity during structured (sports and physical conditioning) and unstructured play (time outside or walking to school). Also gather information about the child's sedentary behaviors, both recreational and educational.

<a id='35052e3b-c214-41b2-8964-3b233c595742'></a>

Sleep: Assess sleep habits including duration, quality, and schedule, as well as symptoms of sleep disorders.

<a id='d3cb853f-e969-4d60-b570-302054ee3864'></a>

_Family History_: Inquire about first- and second-degree relatives' history of obesity and common comorbidities of obesity, such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, liver or gallbladder disease, and respiratory problems.

# Implementation of Nutrition Plan and Monitoring

Although there are numerous diets available for the general public, scientific evidence shows weight loss for children and adolescents should include a reduced calorie intake through consumption of 5 or more servings of fruits and vegetables per day and the elimination of sugar-sweetened beverages, as well as behavioral components such as the following¹⁴:

<a id='883c9760-8ba1-4e2c-9122-663475b05c29'></a>

- Plan what to eat in advance.
- Eat 3 daily meals that are balanced.
- Do not skip meals.
- Make physical activity a daily part of the routine, aiming for more than 1 h/d.
- Decrease sedentary behavior, such as watching television and playing video games, to fewer than 2 h/d.
- Make physical activity fun and age-appropriate for each individual child.

A staged approach to weight management in children and adolescents
is provided in Table 25-2. Specific weight loss goals are recommended
depending on patient's age and BMI percentile as shown in Table 25-3.

# *Diets Designed for Use in Children and Adolescents*
## **Balanced-Macronutrient, Low-Kilocalorie Diet**
Within a multicomponent weight management program, reduced calorie intake (no less than 1200 kcal) in short-term and long-term durations for both children ages 6–12 as well as adolescents has shown to be effective; however, without continual dietary intervention, weight regain is possible.15 The Institute of Medicine has specific sex formulas to calculate total energy expenditure (TEE) for youth who have overweight or obesity. This can be used as a starting point to determine a patient's energy needs for weight maintenance.16 If weight loss is recommended, goals need to be realistic and individualized.

<a id='929ff496-dae6-4f7b-b0ce-9a962003db13'></a>

Weight Maintenance TEE for Boys Ages 3–18 Years Who Are Overweight. To calculate the weight maintenance TEE, use the following equations:

<a id='8ee945dd-2579-4318-a146-ecebdbf75b50'></a>

(Recommended dietary allowance [RDA] for age and weight in kcal/kg
× ideal body weight for height)/actual weight⁴

<a id='15b9c8ef-f8e8-4671-957c-ef703149f100'></a>

PA is the physical activity coefficient:

PA = 1.00 if the physical activity level (PAL) is ≥ 1.0
and < 1.4 (sedentary)

PA = 1.12 if PAL is ≥ 1.4 and < 1.6 (low active)

PA = 1.24 if PAL is ≥ 1.6 and < 1.9 (active)

PA = 1.45 if PAL is ≥ 1.9 and < 2.5 (very active)

<a id='0d730509-188d-4df1-bb7e-803b74bb7900'></a>

_Weight Maintenance TEE for Girls Ages 3–18 Years Who Are Overweight._ To calculate the weight maintenance TEE, use the following equations:

<a id='a6dc1b76-01a4-42a0-8860-dda56bc30dcb'></a>

TEE = [389 – (41.2 × age in years)]
+ (PA × [(15.0 × weight in kilograms) + (701.6 × height in meters)])

PA = 1.00 if PAL is ≥ 1.0 and < 1.4 (sedentary)
PA = 1.18 if PAL is ≥ 1.4 and < 1.6 (low active)
PA = 1.35 if PAL is ≥ 1.6 and < 1.9 (active)
PA = 1.60 if PAL is ≥ 1.9 and < 2.5 (very active)

# MyPlate

MyPlate (https://www.myplate.gov/) was created to replace the Food Guide Pyramid and provide a guide for diet and exercise to help families make healthier food choices. Five food groups are illustrated using a plate and showing relational portions (see Table 25-4).¹⁷ The messaging emphasizes the following:

* Making half your plate fruits and vegetables
* Making at least half your grains whole grains
* Cutting back on sugary drinks and drinking more water

**Weight Loss Medications for Treatment of Pediatric Obesity**

Weight loss through lifestyle changes alone is ideal; however, it has been shown to be less effective, especially within the severe obesity category.19 The use of pharmacotherapy may be used in adjunctive therapy for a more aggressive treatment option within a tertiary care center.14

<a id='e4e2d370-e0ea-47e0-a77b-5a5df4ec47bd'></a>

**_Weight Loss Surgery_**

Because of lifestyle modifications having a modest effect on weight
loss29, weight loss surgery needs to be seriously considered in the
treatment for adolescents with severe obesity. The American Society of
Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery has created guidelines for the selection
of appropriate adolescent patients for weight loss surgery, seen in
Exhibit 25-3.20 Although physical maturity such as Tanner staging and
linear growth were previously used to determine suitability for weight

<a id='77cd8829-b337-4ae2-8d68-6cc6105c5ecb'></a>

loss surgery, no data has shown these measurements are affected negatively by weight loss surgery, and they should not be used to determine appropriateness for surgery.21

## EXHIBIT 25-3. Indications and Contradictions for Adolescent Weight Loss Surgery

Indications for adolescent weight loss surgery:
* BMI >= 35 kg/m2 or 120% of the 95th percentile with a comorbidity (T2D, NAFLD, HTN, hyperlipidemia, OSA)
* BMI >= 40 kg/m2 or 140% of the 95th percentile

<a id='fdf6c9a4-1fac-4285-b220-cab8468e330f'></a>

Contraindications for adolescent weight loss surgery:
* Medically correctable cause of obesity
* Ongoing substance use (within previous year)
* A condition (medical, psychiatric, psychosocial, or cognitive) that prevents adherence with postoperative regimens
* Current or planned pregnancy within 12–18 mo of surgery

Under the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program, a multidisciplinary team must examine the patient and consult with the family to determine their ability to adhere to recommended treatments pre- and postoperatively. The team should include the following²⁰:

* Surgeon (experienced in weight loss surgery)
* Pediatric specialist (specialty in endocrinology, gastroenterology, nutrition, and/or adolescent medicine)
* Registered dietitian
* Mental health specialist
* Coordinator (registered nurse, social worker, or team member responsible for coordinating care for each patient)
* Exercise physiology/physical therapist

## Diet Progression

The diet advancement guidelines for weight loss surgery, including Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG), will vary by consistency, texture of food, and progression of amount of food eaten at each meal, as shown in Table 25-6.22

# Micronutrient Needs for Adolescents

There is a potential for deficiencies after weight loss surgery; therefore, adolescents will need to take a daily vitamin and mineral supplement regimen. Annual nutrition-related laboratory tests should be obtained to evaluate that a patient's individual supplement needs are met. Ensure the following standard supplementation regimen for RYGB and SG patients22,23:

<a id='582db69e-0f50-4417-910b-c21162cc8d9c'></a>

- Multivitamin–multimineral supplement
  - Thiamin: 1.2 mg for male patients and 1.1 mg for female patients
  - Folic acid: 400 µg for male and female patients
  - Iron: 8 mg for male patients, 18 mg for female patients
  - Copper: 900 µg for male and female patients
- Vitamin B12
  - Dosage: 350–500 µg/d as an oral, sublingual, or nasal supplement or 1000 µg/mo intramuscularly
- Calcium
  - Dose: 1200 mg
  - Calcium citrate or carbonate and should include Vitamin D
- Vitamin D3
  - Dosage: 3000 IU/d
- Elemental iron
  - Dosage: iron in multivitamin possibly sufficient for some patients (males); 45–60 mg/d possibly needed for menstruating female patients

_**Monitoring**_

Follow-up with the child or adolescent is essential to monitor and evaluate change. Data that can be monitored and evaluated could come from anthropometric measurements, food- and nutrition-related history, biochemical data, medical tests and procedures, and physical nutrition-focused findings. Follow-up between a provider and patient within 1 week to 1 month is ideal. Within stage 1, “Prevention Plus” or stage 2, "Structured Weight Management,” monthly follow-ups are recommended, whereas weekly follow-up appointments for 8–12 weeks and subsequent monthly follow-ups are recommended for a patient within stage 3, "Comprehensive Multidisciplinary Intervention.”2,14

# Guidelines

Clinical Guidelines are systematically developed statements to assist practitioner and patient decisions about appropriate nutrition care for specific clinical circumstances; they define the role of specific diagnostic and treatment modalities in the diagnosis and management of patients; and they contain recommendations based on evidence from rigorous systematic reviews and evaluation of the published medical literature.

## Consensus Recommendations

Consensus Recommendations answer questions for which the level of evidence in the literature did not support any GRADE-level recommendations. These documents address questions about a nutrition practice topic using weaker supporting literature and expert opinion and consensus recommendations as well as identify areas for future research. These recommendations are not clinical guidelines as defined by ASPEN. The need to deliver practice information to clinicians, even when it is of a consensus nature from practice experts, remains an important role of ASPEN.
