Preface

<a id='3988e2c8-738d-4c1d-92cc-a2f4805ff51f'></a>

The period from infancy through adolescence is a time of rapid growth and development filled with many critical milestones, which if missed, cannot be overcome. This rapid growth leads to higher metabolic needs. Nutrition plays an essential role in optimizing growth and developmental outcomes during these life stages, putting children at high risk for malnutrition.

<a id='b76a9e57-7547-408c-be49-c1d63f911958'></a>

To provide the best care for children, practitioners must know how to recognize malnutrition and identify children who are at risk to provide appropriate evidenced-based nutrition support for both prevention and treatment. There is no single parameter that reflects nutritional status. Therefore, nutrition support for pediatric patients requires comprehensive screening, assessment, intervention, and follow-up. It is important to recognize the complex and changing nature of nutrition and nutrition support in this young population and to understand the importance of timely assessment and clear communication between families, patients, and the health care team in all settings.

This handbook is divided into three sections to guide clinicians as they provide nutrition support-related care for neonates, infants, children, and adolescents. Part I, "Nutrition Status," outlines how to assess the nutritional status of neonatal and pediatric patients. Part II, "Nutrition Care Plan," addresses how to develop parenteral and enteral nutrition care plans for neonates, infants, children, and adolescents. Part III, "Disease-Specific Nutrition," reviews nutrition considerations for pediatric patients with acute and chronic illness.

# Overview

Nutrition assessment lies at the heart of the nutrition care process, which involves developing a nutrition diagnosis, creating a nutrition care plan, and monitoring progress.¹ Nutrition assessment is the "systematic process of collecting and interpreting information to make decisions about the nature and cause of nutrition-related health issues that affect an individual."² Assessment of nutrition involves a detailed history of cooccurring medical conditions and clinical considerations, a meticulous history of the food intake pattern, anthropometric variables, monitoring growth and weight gain velocity, and appropriate laboratory evaluation. These factors are all incorporated into a nutrition diagnosis that defines the chronicity and cause of the nutrition problem. A nutrition intervention plan follows with a clear outline of the goals and establishes which parameters will be used to define a positive outcome.¹

<a id='96ea2aef-596e-47be-999f-2e48456796d4'></a>

This chapter focuses on the nutrition assessment of infants and children,
including ancillary conditions, factors, and indicators that come into play when
assessing a child's nutrition and diagnosing malnutrition.

<a id='a37fbb21-a000-4995-9603-77d7e8b1ad72'></a>

# Nutrition Screening

Nutrition "screening" and "assessment" are different processes. The former indicates risk factors for a nutrition condition and the latter provides the nutrition diagnosis.3 Nutrition risk screening should be completed upon presentation to all health care settings to ensure opportunities for remediation of malnutrition are not lost.

<a id='dd60397f-0c6d-4920-8776-5834d9321ca3'></a>

Early identification of nutrition risk facilitates timely nutrition intervention, potentially limiting malnutrition-related complications. Nutrition screening is an important preliminary step that identifies the risk of a nutrition problem. Nutrition screening also initiates entry into the nutrition care process. It identifies the need for additional nutrition assessment and the need for referral to a registered dietitian (RD) for a potential diagnosis of nutrition-related problem(s).

<a id='faf964a0-1b5b-4182-9599-abf4258388ce'></a>

Nutrition screening tools are used to identify the risk of malnutrition or change in the risk of malnutrition, which can occur during periods of illness. Nutrition screening tools should make screening quick and easy to complete. They should allow the process to be completed by staff without formal nutrition training. The most common parameters included in the tools to identify malnutrition risk are the following:
* Appetite or dietary intake
* Clinical information, such as the presence of a medical condition that impacts nutrition status or medical treatment
* One or more anthropometric measures and/or concerns about weight or growth⁴

<a id='6190c7f1-b041-4c58-b633-60c1c9a51bad'></a>

Nutrition screening tools that have demonstrated moderate to high validity,
reliability, and agreement are preferred. The use of tools that have low or
undemonstrated validity and reliability may result in missing individuals at risk for
malnutrition. It may also result in referral for nutrition assessments for those who
are not at risk.

<a id='0bec9143-653e-4594-8cd8-179e1e8ef567'></a>

Tools used to identify malnutrition risk should be valid and reliable for the population and setting. Although no screening tool can be 100% accurate, pediatric nutrition screening tools should have at least moderate to high validity and reliability based on grade 1 (good/strong) or grade 2 (fair) evidence. Although there are gaps in validation for pediatric nutrition screening tools for use in the outpatient setting, simple tools such as the Pediatric Nutrition Screening Tool (PNST), which consists of 4 questions, can be used in these settings.4 Exhibit 1-1 lists the questions in the PNST and its scoring.5

# Nutrition Assessment and Interpretation

Upon completion of the nutrition risk screen, children who are deemed to be at nutrition risk should be referred for further nutrition assessment. The purpose of nutrition assessment is to determine whether a nutrition problem or diagnosis exists and whether nutrition intervention is indicated. The nutrition assessment includes the following detailed data collection:

* The child's health and wellbeing
* The child's intake
* Anthropometric measures
* Weight gain and growth velocity and appropriate growth charts
* A nutrition-focused physical examination
* Laboratory evaluation

<a id='b4b8bdd9-637b-4e99-90dc-c9fd5c8f9ee8'></a>

**Data for the Nutrition Assessment**

The nutrition providers who complete the nutrition assessment should ensure that all available information pertaining to the child's nutrition status is reviewed as part of this process. There are several data sources for nutrition assessment:

*   The health record
    *   Biochemical data
    *   Medical/surgical history
    *   Vital signs
    *   Medical procedures/consultations
    *   Medication
        *   Route of delivery
    *   Recorded anthropometric measurements/growth history

<a id='1e2d27f8-7daa-486c-9638-b5cefb0a2237'></a>

- Data created during the assessment
  - Client interview
  - Nutrient intake data
    - Mode of delivery
  - Obtained anthropometric measurements
  - Physical assessment
  - Biochemical Data
- Other
  - Birth history
  - Feeding history
  - Developmental history
  - Achievement of developmental milestones
  - Social and family environment⁹

<a id='a3997ccd-7b5d-4197-864a-b1448aabf666'></a>

Assessing nutrition status enables health professionals from a variety of disciplines to identify whether children are growing appropriately or whether they are at risk of under- or overnutrition or inadequate growth or weight gain. See also chapter 3, "Clinical Considerations," "Feeding, Eating, and Drinking Difficulties, Including Swallowing Problems (Dysphagia)" section for specific questions related to children with eating and drinking difficulties.

<a id='fd37b4dd-bb6a-4314-84b5-e5810397e103'></a>

### Diet Assessment Methods
Assessing the adequacy and appropriateness of a child's nutrient intake is essential to nutrition assessment, and should include a comprehensive review of the key elements of the child's diet history.

<a id='d9063fbc-370a-4947-95eb-47a70901eac3'></a>

# Key Elements of a Pediatric Diet History

The key elements of a pediatric diet history include the following:

* Type and amount of food, beverages, formula, and human milk consumed and route of intake
* Methods of food or formula preparation
* Feeding history/introduction of solids
* Meal/snack frequency/duration
* Use of/skill with eating utensils/cups
* Gastrointestinal function/gastroesophageal reflux, constipation
* Urinary output, quality/quantity
* Sleep schedule
* Caregiver/child interaction at meals/meal location/setting

<a id='19e5d0a4-d701-475a-91f5-f36bf0548e6a'></a>

## Approaches to Quantify Nutrient Intake
There are several approaches to quantify nutrient intake data:
* Diet history is designed to determine the pattern of usual food intake. This type of history queries the types and frequency of foods eaten and includes the intake of nutrition supplements. The diet history is generally a detailed interview conducted by a registered dietitian nutritionist. An estimate of nutrient intake can then be calculated from the collected data.

<a id='4e2f8904-adaa-44be-9478-4faddd010ed4'></a>

- *24-hour recall* provides an estimate of nutrient intake based on the child's or their caregiver's recollection of food consumed over the previous day. This method has been used successfully for groups of individuals; however, it is less valid in evaluating diet adequacy for an individual because the 24-hour period assessed may not represent the usual diet. Nutrient intakes calculated from 24-hour recalls may be lower than those based on dietary histories or food records. This method has many online applications for use with caregivers and older children. 10
- *3–7 day food records* provide prospective food intake data. These are recorded by the parent, child, or other caregiver. These types of records require literacy. They must be returned to the nutrition care provider for analysis. Food records encompassing 7 days may provide more accurate information than those of shorter duration, as they include both weekend and weekday meal patterns. However, accuracy of diet recordkeeping can deteriorate over time. When a 7-day food record is not possible, use of shorter time periods including selected days of the week is an alternative. 11
- *Nutrient intake analysis (calorie count)* is frequently ordered in inpatient facilities to assess a child's food intake. These are used to determine a child's ability to consume enough food for growth or to verify the achievement and adequacy of a prescribed feeding regimen. These records, however, do not provide data representative of intake within the home environment.
- *Food frequencies* estimate the frequency and amounts of specific foods eaten. These often consist of questionnaires that can be self-administered and therefore reduce professional interview time. The questionnaire generally cannot retrieve unique details of an individual's diet unless designed to do so. Overreporting of food intake is common with this method. 12,13 Table 1-2 outlines the advantages and disadvantages of food intake collection methods. 14

# Nutrition Analysis Programs

After a food or nutrition intake history is obtained, there are several options for performing a nutrient analysis. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference¹⁵ is a major source of food composition data in the United States and provides the foundation for most food composition databases in the public and private sectors. FoodData Central provides expanded nutrient data and links to related agricultural and experimental research. Other food analysis options include software programs that are available for purchase. Some of the most popular options for health professionals include the following:

<a id='812866ea-f460-46ff-8dbe-f3df442754f0'></a>

* The USDA food and nutrient database (FoodData Central: https://fdc.nal.usda.gov)
* Food Processor (https://esha.com/products/food-processor)
* Nutritionist Pro (https://nutritionistpro.com)
* Nutrihand (https://www.nutrihand.com/Static/index.html)
* Information for families and caregivers regarding food and nutrition:
  * "Nutrition Resources for Parents, Caregivers, and Teachers"
    (https://www.nutrition.gov/topics/nutrition-age/teens/parents-caregivers-and-teachers)
  * USDA MyPlate (https://www.myplate.gov)
  * American Academy of Pediatrics (https://www.healthychildren.org/english/healthy-living/nutrition/pages/default.aspx)
  * CalorieKing (for calories in common "fast foods" (https://www.calorieking.com)

<a id='2155f121-40f1-44a8-be99-2e51d1e28f25'></a>

## Assessing Intake in Infants

For infants who are exclusively breastfed, adequacy of intake is based on the
duration of feeding, hydration status, and growth as reflected in weight gain
velocity. Table 1-3 provides information based on age for infants who receive
human milk at the chest. For information on how much to feed an infant, refer to the
American Academy of Pediatrics website

<a id='21ea56d1-1b71-4c95-8df9-364fb5f773bb'></a>

(https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/How-Often-and-How-Much-Should-Your-Baby-Eat.aspx). Table 1-3 outlines the approximate frequency of feedings and volumes, the urinary and stool output, and the expected weight gain per day or week.16

When discussing nutrient intake with caregivers, it is important to determine how the food and formula are prepared. Asking what product is used, how much is made, and how it is made can assist with the assessment of nutrient intake of the child. The following are examples of questions regarding infant and pediatric formula preparation:

<a id='f148ba31-c2fe-43b0-8439-a9d090d8cc8a'></a>

* What is the name of the pediatric or infant formula the child is receiving?
* Is the formula being used as a ready-to-serve product?
* How and where is the formula prepared and stored?
* Is there a special recipe for mixing the formula or is it made as per can instructions?
  * What is the exact recipe?
    * How much water is used?
    * How much powder or liquid concentrate is being used?
    * Is water or powder added first?
    * How much liquid concentrate is used and how much water is added?

<a id='4a810c10-15da-4040-956c-6180fb123feb'></a>

* Is anything else being added to the formula (eg, thickeners, medications, vitamins)?

**Anthropometric Measurement**

Anthropometric measures followed longitudinally are integral to the nutrition assessment. All anthropometric measurements are most useful as serial measurements, taken by the same person, whenever possible.

Weights, length, or height are standard measurements for all children. Head circumference should be measured in infants and children under 2 years of age. If the child has a head circumference that does not match the child's other parameters, the weight for length can be impacted. For example, a very small head circumference, as is seen in microcephaly, can skew the weight for height downward making a child who may be adequately nourished plot low on the weight-for-length curve. A plateauing head circumference can be an indicator of severe chronic malnutrition, as weight and length measurements are generally impacted before the head circumference plateaus. Each of the measurements must be compared with another measurement to see whether the child's weight is proportional to their length or height. Any anthropometric measurement in isolation does not provide valid information.

<a id='61867921-5d35-4548-aa5d-de89a82b3bea'></a>

Mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC), triceps skinfold (TSF), and midarm muscle circumference are measurements used to evaluate body fat and muscle stores and thereby are proxies for body composition. These measurements are useful in further evaluating the nutrition status of infants and children who fall into a wasted or overweight status or who have altered body composition due to NI.

<a id='9b8ede89-647b-47f3-965a-e445331ee021'></a>

In children who are acutely ill, fluid shifts and edema may make the weight unreliable. In this situation, the MUAC and TSF are important indicators, as they are less sensitive to fluid shifts. In the critical care setting, MUAC may be a more sensitive indicator to identify acute malnutrition in children.17–22

**Measurement Techniques**

Obtaining accurate anthropometric measurements is crucial to the assessment of the nutrition status of children. The use of the correct equipment and thorough training of personnel are essential to ensuring accurate measurements are performed. The following information provides guidelines for obtaining accurate measurements. Table 1-4 provides details on measuring anthropometrics in children and references values to use in the assessment of the values. 23-27

_**Interpreting Anthropometric Measurements**_

Anthropometric measures are an integral part of the nutrition assessment. They allow comparison with other children's growth patterns through reference standards and are therefore important for assessing and monitoring nutrition goals.

<a id='c3153c06-c3ee-498d-b5bb-fa4ce11b6fd3'></a>

### Interpreting Weight
Like any anthropometric measure, a weight cannot be interpreted without understanding how it compares with a child's other anthropometric measures and in the context of the child's health and nutrition history. method of understanding weight gain is to look at the weight gain velocity, which assesses whether a child is meeting weight gain goals for age compared with other children.

<a id='2ff22b60-c0e0-4a1a-9834-6cbafc238c6d'></a>

Table 1-6 demonstrates weight gain velocity at different percentiles and their approximate z score equivalents on the World Health Organization (WHO) growth standards,18 whereas Tables 1-7 and 1-8 look at weight and height gain stratified by age and sex. 18,28,29 See also chapter 2, “Malnutrition in Preterm Infants and Neonates” section

Recovery Growth. Recovery or "catch-up" growth can be seen when an acceleration in weight gain velocity occurs after a period of weight loss or poor weight gain. In general, recovery growth happens in a stepwise fashion of weight gain, MUAC gain, and, finally, height gain, a reverse of the order in which the losses occur.

# Interpreting Length and Height

Well-nourished children who meet their nutrient needs should follow a stable growth trajectory on a percentile or z score curve [see discussion of z scores in "Use of z Scores (SDs vs Percentiles)" section in this chapter]. Plotting a single data point allows the provider to compare the child's growth to the reference standard. When sequential plots are recorded, the child's growth trajectory can be described. Multiple recorded data points allow the child's growth to be tracked over time.

<a id='fb7d6b38-4101-4bee-b28e-662d6f2796a9'></a>

Although downward trends of height percentiles on growth charts can be indicators of poor nutrition status, height is also influenced by hereditary factors, and, therefore, in children aged 2–9 years, interpretation of the height status can be improved by assessing the midparental height.30

<a id='a26cd709-00a6-4b15-80cf-ba54016b15c7'></a>

A child's height percentile before pubertal growth should fall within 2 SDs or
8.5 cm of midparental height, which is calculated as follows³¹:

<a id='694075c6-25fe-4cfd-9c1a-d8ffe7f9554b'></a>

Males: [(father's height in centimeters + mother's height in centimeters) + 13] / 2

Females: [(father's height in centimeters + mother's height in centimeters) - 13] / 2

<a id='fcd36cf8-6679-4fa5-b9fb-55c178a20f02'></a>

Health and wellness, nutrition intake, and pubertal status all impact growth. A detailed chart of the assessment of pubertal status can be found in _the ASPEN Pediatric Nutrition Support Core Curriculum_.30 Pubertal development can also be classified by using a child and parent reporting algorithm (Pubertal Development Scale),32 which may be adequate for most applications for nutrition reasons. This tool compares favorably to traditional visual staging done according to the Tanner staging of puberty.33

**Interpreting Body Mass Index**

Body mass index (BMI) correlates with body fat, and a high BMI has been linked to future obesity. Age-related increases in BMI are associated with increases in fat mass and fat-free mass, depending on the age, sex, and pubertal maturation of the child. The BMI z-score for age is the recommended nutrition indicator to screen children ages 2 years and older to identify individuals who are underweight, overweight, or have obesity. To calculate BMI, use one of the following equations:

<a id='036bff45-0b1a-4877-a9bd-24b820e1f92b'></a>

Weight in kilograms/height in meter squared
(Weight in kilograms/height in meters)/height in meters

<a id='033710b7-5773-4d84-ad3e-98475db1f341'></a>

BMI can be difficult to interpret in children who have skeletal deformities or are unable to stand because of NI, as height measurement errors are magnified by BMI calculation.

<a id='4419be67-1555-4b47-baa2-ffb9acb6e333'></a>

Comparing the weight and height by using weight for length or BMI plays an important role in assessing nutrition status and making a nutrition diagnosis.
Table 1-9 outlines the WHO cutoff points for various nutrition states based on weight for length or BMI. The values are expressed in terms of z scores, which are an expression of SDs above or below the mean in a normal distribution of values.34
[For a discussion of z scores, see "Use of z Scores (SDs vs Percentiles)" section in this chapter].

# Growth Charts

*Growth Charts for All Children.* All anthropometric measures should be compared with appropriate reference standards. The WHO growth charts<sup>18</sup> were developed by using measurements of children of many ethnic backgrounds. They demonstrate how children with access to good nutrition will grow when raised in environmental conditions favorable to growth. At under 24 months, growth should be analyzed with the WHO international growth standards for weight, length, weight for length, and head circumference, regardless of the feeding method. Healthy breastfed infants typically gain weight faster than healthy formula-fed infants during the first 3–4 months. Growth after 2 years of age should be monitored on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) growth reference charts published in 2000 for children in the United States, as these are national growth references.<sup>19</sup> Some countries use the WHO growth charts for all ages. Exhibit 1-3 is a comparison of WHO and CDC growth charts and when to consider use of the growth standards and growth reference charts.<sup>18,19,34</sup>

- A growth standard defines a recommended "model" pattern of growth associated with specified health outcomes and minimization of long-term risks of disease. It represents the best description of physiologic growth for children from birth to 5 years.
- These prescriptive standards are based on term, singleton babies receiving optimal health care, with a nonsmoking mother, predominantly breastfed for at least 4 months, at least partially breastfed until 12 months, and with introduction of complementary foods between 4 and 6 months. Children that were excluded include preterm and very low birth weight infants (<1500 g).
- In addition, they are based on international sample population in 6 different countries (Brazil, Ghana, India, Norway, Oman, and the United States).

**2007 WHO Growth Reference Charts From 5 to 19 Yearsb**
* A growth reference describes the growth pattern of a defined population without making claims about health status.
* They are updated to address the obesity epidemic and are therefore closer to being considered growth standards than the CDC growth charts.
* Data fitted to an almost perfect match of measurements at 5 years of age between the growth standards and growth references. At 19 years of age, BMI for age at the 85th percentile (overweight) and the 97th percentile (obesity) match almost perfectly with adult cutoffs for BMI of 25 and 30, respectively.
  * Set 1 of the WHO child growth standards and growth references includes the third, 15th, 50th, 85th, 97th, and 99.99th percentiles, which closely correspond to z score cutoff points that define pediatric malnutrition.
  * Set 2 of the WHO Child Growth Standards include the third, 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th and 97th percentiles.

**2000 CDC Growth Charts**
* The CDC growth charts represent the standard growth reference for American children describing how children grew in a particular place and time. The CDC recommends using the WHO growth charts before 2 years of age and using the CDC growth charts from 2 to 20 years.
* The clinical charts for infants and older children were published in 2 sets:
  * Set 1 contains 10 charts (5 for boys and 5 for girls), which include the fifth, 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th, and 95th smoothed percentile lines for all charts and the 85th percentile for BMI for age and weight for stature.
  * Set 2 contains 10 charts (5 for boys and 5 for girls), which include the third, 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th, and 97th smoothed percentile lines for all charts and the 85th percentile for BMI for age and weight for stature.

Specialized Growth Charts. Specialized growth charts are available for children with genetic or neurodevelopmental conditions; often, they are developed by using small historical samples that predate optimized nutrition care. Specialized growth charts should always be used together with standard WHO or CDC growth charts.

<a id='e910ea9d-f955-4256-b16a-f5b28c5f7547'></a>

When assessing specialized growth charts, check the following:
* What are the sources of the data, sample size, and age of participants?
* How was the data collected?
  * What measurements were collected?
  * Are the curves "smoothed?"
  * Are weights and heights collected appropriately?
* Was the information generated before treatment for the condition or nutrition support was available?

Trisomy 21 is the most common chromosomal variation. Growth charts have
been developed and should be used to plot children with this genetic condition. Two
trisomy 21 growth charts are in common usage.<sup>35,36</sup>

Cerebral palsy (CP) is a neuromuscular condition that affects motor function and tone. It is the most common of the neuromuscular/neurodevelopmental conditions, and it impacts motor functioning and is often used as a prototype for children with NI. Specific growth charts for children with CP are available online (see https://www.lifeexpectancy.org/articles/GrowthCharts.shtml), although their use is not without controversy, as they have not been clinically validated. They are representative of how a large cohort of children with CP grew but do not tell us how the children "should grow.” They are descriptive, not prescriptive.

<a id='ef4fa0be-4e49-497b-8e66-d69068ef63ad'></a>

The CP-specific growth charts are stratified by sex, tube feeding, and functional severity by using the Gross Motor Function Classification Scale (GMFCS). By using the GMFCS, children can be classified according to their motor function before their second birthday to 18 years.37 Table 1-10 provides a brief description of GMFCS levels. Team members from disciplines not regularly using the GMFCS should rely on the disciplines on their teams for help with this classification to enable plotting on the CP growth charts. GMFCS level 5 is the only level stratified by tube feeding status.
