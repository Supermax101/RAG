Systolic ejection murmurs present in the delivery room are usually pathologic and may be related to pulmonary or aortic stenosis. These are best heard at the second left or right intercostal spaces.\n\n<a id='9306465e-0af2-4852-b70d-95287ec95dc0'></a>\n\n3. Systolic regurgitant murmurs begin with S1, with no interval between S1 and the beginning of the murmur. These murmurs generally continue throughout systole (pansystolic or holosystolic), and are caused by flow of blood from a chamber at a higher pressure to one at a lower pressure. These are associated with VSD, mitral regurgitation, and tricuspid regurgitation.\n\n<a id='680aab66-e5cd-496b-a51c-05f1474349c2'></a>\n\n4. Diastolic murmurs are classified by the timing of the murmur:\n\na. Early diastolic murmurs occur right after S2 and are related to incompetence of the aortic or pulmonary valve. Aortic murmurs are high- pitched and best heard at the third left intercostal space. They occur with bicuspid aortic valve and subaortic infundibular VSD. Pulmonary regurgitation murmurs are heard best at the second left intercostal space and occur with postoperative TOF , pulmonary hypertension, postoperative pulmonary valvotomy or deformity of the pulmonary valve.\n\nb. Mid-diastolic murmurs result from abnormal ventricular filling. These are low pitched and may be associated with mitral stenosis or large left-to-right shunt lesions such as a VSD or PDA.\n\nc. Late diastolic murmurs result from flow through AV valves during ventricular diastole and are low frequency murmurs.\n\n<a id='bd98a20b-447b-4aef-a20e-0d1de12bb412'></a>\n\n5. Murmurs due to left-to-right shunt lesions may not be heard until the 2nd to 4th week of life, when the pulmonary vascular resistance decreases and flow into the lungs increases.\n6. Ejection clicks can be normal in the first 24 hrs of life, but after that are considered pathologic. May be associated with dilation of a great artery, malformation of a semilunar valve (aortic or pulmonary) or truncal valve in truncus arteriosus.\n\n<a id='456d6352-2235-4100-bc97-9096a29f78a1'></a>\n\n**H. Blood Pressure:**\n\nFour extremity blood pressures may be helpful in identifying an aortic arch lesion. A systolic pressure more than 10 mmHg higher in the upper body as compared to the lower body should raise concern for a coarctation of the aorta, aortic arch hypoplasia or interrupted aortic arch.\n\n<a id='898cf1b2-9a6d-4a04-aa3c-14ee90da5f3e'></a>\n\nI. Pulse ox screen:\n\nUtilized to detect critical CHD that requires intervention in the first year of life. Up to 25-30% of CHD diagnosed in the first month of life may be critical. Critical CHD may be prostaglandin dependent for pulmonary blood flow (e.g. Tetralogy of Fallot or pulmonary atresia/intact ventricular septum) or for systemic blood flow (e.g. hypoplastic left heart syndrome). Critical CHD also includes mixing lesions that may lead to damage to the pulmonary vascular bed and congestive heart failure in the first year of life (e.g. truncus arteriosus, total anomalous pulmonary venous return). The State of California mandates pulse ox screening for all neonates prior to discharge from the WBN or intensive care nursery (NICU or ICN) if an echocardiogram has not been performed.\n\n<a id='ab021be5-8f19-46cb-8441-7cc5240c4d2d'></a>\n\n1. There are 7 primary targets of pulse ox screening: hypoplastic left heart syndrome, pulmonary atresia with intact septum, tetralogy of fallot, total anomalous pulmonary venous return, transposition of the great arteries, tricuspid atresia, and truncus arteriosus. Five secondary targets include: coarctation of the aorta, double outlet right ventricle, Ebstein's anomaly, interrupted aortic arch and single ventricle.\n2. Screening recommended between 24-48 hours\n   a. Right hand (pre-ductal) and one foot (post-ductal)\n\n<a id='d6ee9dc2-36d4-4e5c-9e9f-b7c2270e0d17'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Pass screen if O2sat >= 95% in both probes AND there is <= 3% difference between the two probe readings\n\nc. LPCH Policy on failed screen:\n\ni. Critically failed screen if <90% in either probe, notify MD immediately\n\nii. Failed screen if 90-94% on both extremities OR > 3% difference between both extremities – repeat screen in 4 hours and if still fail, notify MD immediately\n\nd. The timing of pulse ox screening in ill infants is not well established.\n\n3. Physical exam important – pulse ox not perfect, particularly in left sided lesions such as coarctation and interrupted aortic arch – make sure to feel for pulses!\n\n<a id='27609d4d-055e-4321-8b5d-7f0d05510a39'></a>\n\n## II. Diagnostic Studies\n\n### A. Chest x-ray (frontal and lateral views):\nEvaluate the heart size and shape, location of the aortic arch (right vs. left), and cardiac situs. Also view the lungs to evaluate if lungs are dark (poorly perfused) or opaque (increased pulmonary blood flow). Examples of \"textbook\" cardiac silhouettes include \"boot shaped\" heart (TOF) and a heart that looks like an \"egg on a string\" (d-transposition of the great arteries).\n\n### B. Electrocardiogram (ECG):\n1. Because it reflects the hemodynamic relationships that existed in utero, a normal newborn ECG is notable for right ventricular predominance. However, the ECG may be normal for age despite structural pathology.\n2. Evaluation should include duration of the P wave, QRS complex, QT interval (corrected for rate), calculation of the PR, RP, ST segments, and evaluation of the T-wave morphology.\n\n### C. Echocardiology:\nAn echocardiogram should be obtained if there is a concern for CHD. This will be a 2-dimensional study supplemented with color Doppler.\n\n### D. Cardiac Catheterization:\nMay be utilized for anatomic definition if not demonstrated adequately by echocardiography. Indications for cardiac catheterization include:\n1. Therapeutic: balloon atrial septostomy, balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty, balloon aortic valvuloplasty.\n2. Diagnostic: to provide further anatomic definition (e.g., coronary artery anatomy in pulmonary atresia or D-TGA, aortopulmonary collateral anatomy in TOF with pulmonary atresia)\n\n### E. CT Angiography\nMay be utilized for diagnostic purposes to provide further anatomic delineation, e.g. aortopulmonary collateral anatomy in TOF with pulmonary atresia, coronaries\n\n<a id='e2e2af74-827a-4655-97fd-683937ff34ab'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Neonates with congenital heart disease should be resuscitated with 21% FiO2 as with normal newborn patients requiring resuscitation. Infant with severe cyanosis in a mixing lesion and an oxygen saturation of less than 70% should be provided a 5% increase in the amount of oxygen every one minute until Sa02 rises to >75% and monitored closely to ensure that the Sa02 remains in the range of 75-85%. Once the oxygen saturation is ≥75%, oxygen should be discontinued. A STAT echocardiogram should be ordered to confirm the prenatal diagnosis. The cardiology service should be immediately notified upon NICU admission. At birth, the PVR generally is higher and takes time to decrease, thus patients with propensity for increased ratio of pulmonary blood flow: systemic blood flow (Qp: Qs), such as patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, atrioventricular canal defects and truncus arteriosus, are not likely to have increased Qp early on.\n\nB. **ER and NICU Admissions**\n\nInfants admitted from the ER in shock need immediate correction of metabolic acidosis with volume expanders first, and possibly bicarbonate. Correction of acidosis is necessary to improve cardiac output and tissue/organ perfusion. Vascular access including an arterial line (UAC or peripheral/femoral) and central venous access (PICC, UVC or CVL) is essential. Inotropic support may be required to improve ventricular function, mean arterial pressure, Qp:Qs, and urine output. Infants may also require tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation to manage their CHF, and decrease work of breathing and metabolic demand.\n\n<a id='270fb318-dac8-4e7e-a6fe-b1240f6c7a29'></a>\n\nII. **Pre-op Management**\n\nOnce the initial resuscitation is completed, there are several key points to keep in mind:\n\nA. **Cardiovascular Management**\n\nConsult Cardiology (CV3 team - pager# 2HART) for all infants with CHD and notify them of any changes in status.\n\n1.  **Management**\n    a.  **PGE1 administration** should begin immediately following delivery if there is suspicion of ductal-dependent CHD. Once an echocardiogram is completed and cardiac structure is confirmed normal, or the cardiac lesion confirmed to be not ductal-dependent, then the PGE1 can be discontinued per Cardiology's recommendation.\n        i.  **Ductal-dependent pulmonary flow lesions include**: severe Tetralogy of Fallot, (blue \"Tet\", TET/PA), Ebstein's anomaly, critical pulmonic stenosis, tricuspid valve atresia, and pulmonic valve atresia with intact ventricular septum.\n        ii. **Ductal-dependent systemic flow lesions include**: hypoplastic left heart syndrome, mitral atresia, coarctation, and interrupted aortic arch.\n    b.  **Consider SVR manipulation** by using vasoactive support such as milrinone to decrease afterload in order to balance Qp:Qs.\n\n<a id='372652d9-8637-4e32-9ab4-1171345ec3d2'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Not for outside reproduction or publication without permission.\n\n<a id='54a8020d-fd22-4692-b9a2-9de39259b8e9'></a>\n\nCAPTION ERROR\n\n<a id='fa3021d2-17f0-46f9-b7b4-62bf5de90f2a'></a>\n\nc. Correction of significant metabolic acidosis with either volume expanders or bicarbonate. May need adjustments in SVR as discussed above if metabolic acidosis is due to unbalanced Qp:Qs.\nd. Palliative, staged or complete surgical repair depending on the lesion.\n\n<a id='296a4c42-52ad-4a30-b7cf-793f3049ae6c'></a>\n\n## 2. Monitoring\n\na. **Continuous evaluation of blood pressure.** Normal mean arterial BP is approximately equivalent to the infant's gestational age. If an infant becomes hypotensive, use of inotropes or volume expansion should be carefully evaluated taking into consideration the specific cardiac lesion and clinical condition.\n\nb. **Continuous monitoring of heart rate** is necessary to identify any dysrhythmias. Tachycardic infants should be closely evaluated for fluid status, fever, and other potentially contributing factors. If heart block or other dysrhythmias occur, a 12-lead EKG should be obtained attempting to capture the dysrhythmia. Telemetry is available and should be reviewed regularly. Confirmation of central line placement and evaluation of serum electrolytes should be considered. Cardiology should be notified of any dysrhythmia.\n\n<a id='d43a2644-525e-4f15-9a4b-13820a8dd074'></a>\n\nB. Respiratory Management\n\nInfants with cardiac defects that place them at risk for increased pulmonary blood flow require close monitoring of systemic and pulmonary circulations. The intrauterine circulation is characterized by increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). As PVR decreases over the 1st wk of life, the PDA shunts left-to-right. This creates the potential for excessive blood flow to the lungs relative to the systemic circulation (increased Qp:Qs) leading to pulmonary edema. Pulmonary overcirculation occurs when Qp:Qs is sufficiently unbalanced such that systemic end organ perfusion is compromise, d leading to development of metabolic acidosis and decreased urine output. This can be seen not only in ductal dependent lesions but in large, VSDs, AV canals, truncus arteriosus and other lesions with potential for increased Qp:Qs.\n\n<a id='b2e8ee2c-57fb-4fe3-9b44-fe2c431a0211'></a>\n\n1.  **Management Options:**\n\n    a. If a patient with single ventricle physiology decompensates and requires intubation, this is likely an indication for urgent surgical palliation. The ability to manipulate to PVR through mechanical ventilation is less effective than manipulating SVR to affect Qp:Qs in patients with cardiac defects. Discuss with the CV3 team and CV surgeon.\n\n    b. Decrease respiratory drive with **sedation in infants who are intubated**. Paralysis may be used in conjunction with sedation in order to achieve this effect.\n\n<a id='3ddeab4c-cd53-4090-a0ae-29ed36e41cb4'></a>\n\n## 2. Monitoring:\n\nInfants with mixing lesions have an oxygen saturation goal of 75-85% and/or a PaO2 in the high 30's to mid 40's. It is important to look at both measures when making management decisions. When pulmonary vascular resistance begins to decrease, there may be an initial increase in SaO2 and PaO2. However, as increased pulmonary flow develops, the oxygen saturation and PaO2 may decrease secondary to pulmonary fluid overload and the infant may develop signs of low systemic perfusion (decreased urine output, prolonged capillary refill, and radiographic evidence of pulmonary edema). These clinical symptoms need to be corrected quickly using the previously described measures, before metabolic acidosis complicates the infant's condition. Serial lactate levels are useful in detecting decreased systemic oxygen delivery.\n\n<a id='6158218d-78cd-46ab-9466-00f51c7937b2'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Transfuse to maintain hematocrit ≥40%. In patients with single ventricle physiology, a hematocrit ≥40-45% is usually preferred. For initial transfusion, 10 ml/kg of PRBC's is given. If the patient is severely anemic, an additional 5-10 ml/kg of PRBC's may be necessary to achieve the goal hematocrit. Fluid status should be carefully evaluated prior to and following transfusion.\n2. If the coagulation panel is abnormal, correction is usually indicated. Coagulopathies must be corrected if there is clinical evidence of bleeding or if the infant is going to the OR or cath lab.\n\n<a id='111db59e-a360-4f14-850f-e53deadc4f46'></a>\n\nD. Infectious Disease Management\n\n1.  CBC and CRP/procalcitonin as clinically indicated if infection is suspected.\n2.  Antibiotics prior to surgery are not routinely indicated in infants with cardiac anomalies. However, the infant may require antibiotics independent of cardiac disease based on the clinical scenario and laboratory findings. PGE1 may cause intermittent hyperthermia and thereby increase the suspicion of infection.\n\nE. Fluids, Electrolytes, and Nutrition Management\n\n1.  Pre-operative fluids are usually maintained at 60-80 ml/kg/day. Volume expanders may be given for hemodynamic resuscitation.\n2.  Monitoring of electrolytes is important to prevent dysrhythmias and maintain optimal cardiac function. It is particularly important to keep the ionized calcium level normal (>1.2). Maintenance calcium should be added to the IV fluid. CaCl infusion (10-20 mg/kg/dose) should be used to correct the ionized calcium as indicated)\n3.  In general, electrolytes, ABGs, and lactate levels are monitored every 6-12 hrs for the first 48 hrs. Once stable, discuss the frequency with the Cardiology team.\n4.  Start on TPN as soon as stable, advancing AA, IL, and dextrose to optimize caloric intake.\n5.  Furosemide or other diuretics may be indicated, particularly in lesions with left to right shunting leading to increased pulmonary blood flow (Qp). Any change in diuretic therapy should be discussed with Cardiology.\n6.  Consider starting feeds if surgery is not imminent and the infant is stable.\n7.  Avoid upper extremity PICC lines in patients on the single ventricle pathway. The SVC will be utilized as part of the single ventricle palliative repair and placement of a line in the SVC runs the risk of clot formation. If line access is needed and unable to obtain umbilical lines please discuss with CV3 team.\n\n<a id='ffe97632-ec46-47e5-bd3f-56c994937797'></a>\n\nF. Renal Management\n\n1. Renal ultrasound is done pre-operatively to evaluate the kidneys as part of a genetic/dysmorphology work-up in all infants with cardiac anomalies.\n2. Urine output should be closely monitored to evaluate the need for fluid and/or evaluation of systemic perfusion. If the creatinine is elevated and there is concern for renal failure related to a hypoxic ischemic insult to the kidneys, Nephrology should be consulted.\n\n<a id='c72daae2-04d7-40ae-afb5-91d33dfb5e15'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

A head ultrasound should be done prior to surgery to evaluate for anomalies of the brain and to determine if cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) can be performed with an acceptable risk of intracranial bleeding. Infants with significant intracranial hemorrhage or recent cerebral infarct may not be candidates for CPB.\n2. NIRS monitoring is performed in all pre-op patients with cyanotic CHD. aEEG is used for patients who have suspected seizure activity.\n\nH. **Genetic Management**\n\n1. Infants with CHD should be considered for genetic testing. Please see Genetics section for details of which type of study to order.\n\nI. **Transfer for Surgery**\n\n1. A transfer summary must accompany the patient to the OR/CVICU.\n2. Verbal sign out should be coordinated with the CV3 and CVICU teams.\n\n<a id='aafb062f-9bf7-46d3-a772-f27570f2f15c'></a>\n\nII. **Post-op Management**\n\nFor the initial post-operative period, all post-surgical cardiac infants are managed in the CVICU. Once the infant is deemed stable by the CVICU and CV3 Team, the infant may transfer back to the NICU or the 3rd floor for care prior to discharge.\n\n<a id='21327155-88f1-41bc-8284-f7055f1024af'></a>\n\nA. Cardiovascular Management [should be done under guidance of Cardiology]\n\n1. Interventions for slow heart rate\n   a. **Isuprel** (rarely used): Dose: 0.05-0.5 mcg/kg/min IV\n   b. **Atropine**: Dose: 0.01-0.03 mg/kg/dose with minimum dose of 0.1 mg IV\n   c. **Epinephrine**: Dose: 0.01-0.03 mg/kg/dose IV. If infant needs an IV drip, then run dose between 0.01-1 mcg/kg/min IV.\n   d. **Internal pacing** (pacer wires are usually left in for extended period after surgery).\n\n2. Preload\n   a. Volume expanders should be readily available. Infants are at risk for minimal preload/afterload reserve.\n   b. Volume should be given in small increments and blood pressure should be monitored closely.\n\n3. Afterload Reducing Agents (decrease SVR and PVR)\n   a. **Nipride**: Dose: 0.5-2 mcg/kg/min IV\n   b. **Nitroglycerin**: Starting dose usually 0.25-0.5 mcg/kg/min IV. May titrate to 1-5 mcg/kg/min IV.\n   c. **Captopril**: Dose: Premature neonates receive 0.01 mg/kg/dose po/ng every 8-12 hrs. Infants <2 mos of age: 0.05-0.1 mg/kg/dose po/ng and titrate to 0.5 mg/kg/dose every 8 hrs.\n\n<a id='f13b3081-a944-4718-9e99-9d01b3b7753c'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Milrinone: Dose: 0.25-1 mcg/kg/min IV mixed in NS or D5W, may consider load with 50 mcg/kg IV over 20-30 min.\n\n<a id='bf0f1f80-f490-4511-bdb0-33138cbce691'></a>\n\n4. Rhythm-Changing Drugs\n\na. **Adenosine**: For SVT. Dose: 100 mcg/kg IV push increasing at 2-min intervals to maximum of 350 mcg/kg IV. Rapid administration required, run rhythm strip while administering dose to assess change in HR. For this reason, access through an upper extremity is preferred. If no change in rhythm, likely metabolized prior to reaching patient.\n\nb. **Amiodarone**: For SVT, VT, atrial flutter, and JET. Loading dose is 5-10 mg/kg IV over 20 min then maintenance infusion of 5-10 mg/kg/day.\n\nc. **Digoxin**: For CHF and some tachyarrhythmias, as well as standard of care of post-op single ventricle patients. Maintenance is 8 mcg/kg/day IV and 10 mcg/kg/day PO. Discuss with Cardiology if need for digitalization. All Digoxin orders need 2 signature.\n\nd. **Propranolol**: dysrhythmias and hypertension: Dose: Oral: 0.5-1 mg/kg/day po/ng divided every 6-8 hrs and titrate dose every 3-7 days up to 2-4 mg/kg/day. IV dose: 0.01-0.02 mg/kg IV over 10 min; may repeat every 5 min up to a cumulative dose of 0.1 mg/kg.\n\n<a id='3b7c0f29-a4b4-42a0-b14d-a5b8c75a34a4'></a>\n\n5. **Pacer Wires**\n\na. Pacer wires may remain in post-op until just prior to discharge. Discuss with CV Surgery plan for removal.\n\n   Page CVICU APP to to remove wires once indicated. A cardiac ECHO post-removal is not needed. Monitor for clinical signs of tamponade.\n\nb. Infants who experience a change in perfusion and blood pressure should be checked for dysrhythmias. If dysrhythmias are diagnosed and pacing is initiated, make sure the monitor is on \"pacer mode.\" Check the pulse and auscultate the heart rate to ensure adequate capture.\n\nc. JET and atrial tachycardia can be a problem secondary to poor AV conduction. With JET, look for cannon waves noted in the waveform of the atrial line. JET is more common post-operatively after repair of some VSDs and Tetralogy of Fallot. If temporary pacer wires are still present, obtain an atrial EKG to assess P waves.\n\n<a id='2c4ccc6f-4506-4c2a-9034-bd118e77a7f0'></a>\n\n6. Intravascular Line Management\n\na. IJ line – can be discontinued if not needed. APP or MD can de-line.\n\nb. Intracardial lines (RA, LA) – can be discontinued (by CV Surgery Fellow) if not needed. Need recent platelet count and coags prior to line being pulled (platelet > 80K, minimal coags). Need unit of PRBCs at bedside in cooler when line pulled.\n\nc.

Fluids, Electrolytes, and Nutrition Management\n\n1. When starting feedings post-operatively, feedings may be advanced per usual practice in most cardiac patients. The CVICU have a feeding pathways, simple and complex, for infants >2.5kg and these should be referenced when starting feeds in that population.\n\n   Some infants who have cardiac lesions in which blood flow to the bowel may have been compromised preoperatively are at risk for necrotizing enterocolitis. These lesions include the following: interrupted aortic arch repair, coarctation repair, aortic stenosis repair, and HLHS. In these infants, feeds should be advanced slowly and with caution.\n\n2. Other fluids should be managed similarly to the pre-op fluids mentioned above. It is important to maximize calories either in the TPN or by increasing calories and/or volume of feedings. If the infant experiences poor weight gain, and the clinical condition tolerates, fluids can be advanced to 150-160 ml/kg/day and caloric density of feeds increased to 27-30 cal/oz. Advance 2-4 cal/oz per day as tolerated to achieve adequate weight gain.\n\n3. Electrolytes should be monitored daily until stable, then weekly or twice a week if on diuretics. Maintain ionized calcium between 1.3-1.4 during the first 3-4 days; once stable 1.1-1.2 is adequate. Do not infuse calcium drips through lines with TPN or calcium through a PIV!\n\n4. Diuretics may need to be adjusted or changed as dictated by clinical findings such as pulmonary edema or intravascular depletion with Cardiology consultation.\n\n<a id='bb8ce21c-3592-4c85-9f10-4703046d9c88'></a>\n\nD. Hematology Management\n\n1. Check hematocrit at least weekly. May need to check daily if infant is unstable and/or bleeding. Use previously described transfusion parameters if infant is unstable, otherwise may allow infant to fall into more physiologic parameters. Start vitamins and iron once infant is stable on full feeds.\n2. Some infants with shunts or a patch will be on aspirin. The usual dose is 5 mg/kg/day PO/NG and should be continued at discharge.\n\n<a id='5af8ff0c-1525-48ba-ac10-1a0a3c1baba2'></a>\n\nE. **Infectious Disease Management**\n\n1. Immunizations should not be administered for at least 6 weeks post-operatively.\n\n<a id='4fd1d0d7-34f9-4bd2-a505-8d60168ee12d'></a>\n\nF. Neurologic Management\n\n1. If infant has an abnormal neurologic exam, was on ECMO or CPB or previous imaging was abnormal, then a cranial MRI may be indicated prior to discharge. MRI can be done with clips and sternal wires without time constraint. Pacer wires must be removed prior to MRI.\n2. All infants with CHD that require surgery will be followed by LPCH Infant Development Clinic and/or Early Start. The infant's local Infant Development Clinic may choose to not follow these infants.\n\n<a id='a869f551-2ecb-4c6e-af4a-69233c43d167'></a>\n\nG. Genetic Management\n\n1. If chromosomes are pending or normal, and Genetics is concerned that the infant may have a syndrome, then a follow-up exam with Genetics in 3-6 months may be requested.\n2. If infant is diagnosed with a 22q11 microdeletion, Endocrine and Immunology must be consulted, and follow-up with the Genetics and Developmental Clinics are necessary.\n\n<a id='9be90890-a71a-41e0-a4e1-431a89140afb'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Discharge Planning\n\n1.  Plan ahead as much as possible. Appointments and pharmacy prescriptions should be set up at least 2 days prior to discharge.\n2.  For discharge teaching, go to \"Micromedex\" in the computer and click on the section \"Caring for Baby/Child after Heart Surgery.\"\n3.  Parent teaching should be started early for these complex patients.\n4.  Appointments with the PCP and Cardiologist should be scheduled prior to discharge. Please send a packet of information to each that includes the admission H&P, Discharge Summary, and the Operative Note. Additionally, a copy of the last ECHO on disk should be included in the Cardiologist's packet. Follow up will not be in LPCH system.\n5.  Post-Op TOF/PA/MAPCAS\n    a. Need lung perfusion scan prior to discharge. (Place Nuclear Med Order and call 650-723-6855 to schedule)\n    b. Need discharge ECHO.\n    c. If future CV surgery required, discuss with CV3 team, the potential need to have outpatient cardiac catheterization, and possibly surgery date scheduled prior to discharge\n\n<a id='36b85cbf-1d8a-4459-abc9-fe7be435db01'></a>\n\n**Resources:**\n\n1.

Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors\n\nPhosphodiesterase (PDE) is the enzyme responsible for the breakdown of cAMP and cGMP. These inhibitors decrease cAMP and cGMP breakdown and thus affect intracellular calcium concentration resulting in an inotropic effect on the heart and vasodilation in vascular smooth muscle.\n\n<a id='d2df85ae-7954-473d-8110-85a1e666ffbd'></a>\n\nA. Milrinone (PGE5 inhibitor)\n\n1. Prevents breakdown of cyclic AMP.\n2. Increases cardiac output without increasing myocardial oxygen demand and lowers systemic vascular resistance.\n3. Not metabolized, excreted by the kidney.\n\n<a id='45e1558b-0d43-416d-941c-c47fd20d781f'></a>\n\nB. Sildenafil (PGE3 inhibitor)\n\n1. Prevents breakdown of cyclic GMP.\n2. Leads to vascular smooth muscle relaxation and research has demonstrated improvement in neonates with pulmonary hypertension. See Evaluation and Management of Pulmonary Hypertension in the BPD patient for further info.\n3. Metabolized in the liver.\n\n<a id='30d98992-144f-4aed-8155-45bfc5500bb7'></a>\n\nIII. **Vasodilators**\n\nA. **Nitroglycerin**\n\n1. A potent venous vasodilator and a less potent systemic and pulmonary artery dilator.\n2. Metabolized by rapid hepatic and vascular conversion and excreted by the kidneys. Adverse reactions include hypotension with reflex tachycardia.\n\nB. **Sodium Nitroprusside**\n\n1. Cause smooth muscle relaxation with no direct cardiac effect.\n2. Causes a greater reduction in preload and afterload than nitroglycerin.\n3. Converted to cyanide in red blood cell. Cyanide is converted to thiocyanate in liver and is excreted in the urine with a half life of 4-7 days. Therefore either liver or renal dysfunction can increase levels of toxic metabolites. The magnification of significant toxicity can occur with\n   a. Metabolic acidosis\n   b. Increased mixed venous O2 saturation\n   c. Decreased A-V O2 difference\n   d. Decreased O2 transport (Cyanmethemoglobin)\n4. Adverse reactions include cyanide and thiocyanate toxicity, hypotension, and tachycardia.\n\n<a id='ace38007-1047-4791-b21c-6ceb9e413edc'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Hydralazine\n1. Affects the precapillary arterioles causing vasodilation mostly in renal, coronary, cerebral, and splanchnic beds.\n2. Use most frequently for hypertension.\n3. Metabolized in the liver.\n\n<a id='927b0481-cb03-4fab-8663-804e1ff8a158'></a>\n\nIV. **Calcium Antagonists**\n\nReduce inward calcium flux to vascular smooth muscle to act as a vasodilator and a negative inotropic agent.\n\nA. **Nifedipine**\n\n1. Causes a decrease in systemic and pulmonary arterial blood pressure. Metabolized by the liver and excreted by the kidneys.\n2. Primarily used to lower pulmonary vascular resistance and increase pulmonary blood flow in children with pulmonary hypertension.\n\n<a id='80fd9af3-916c-419c-b2c2-2203dc316658'></a>\n\n## V. Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors\n\nAfterload reducing agents. Inhibit conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II in the liver. The effects of angiotensin II include vasoconstriction, augmentation of the sympathetic output, and inhibition of bradykinin, which is a vascular smooth muscle relaxant. Sodium retention is increased by activating the aldosterone system.\n\n### A. Captopril\n\n1. Lowers systemic vascular resistance and systemic blood pressure without an increase in heart rate.\n2. Metabolized in the liver and excreted in bile and by the kidneys.\n3. Hypotension is the most common side effect. Neutropenia and a persistent cough can also occur.\n4. Hyperkalemia can occur with concomitant use of spironolactone\n5. Enteral dosing only: Give at least 1 hour before meals or 2 hours after meals\n\n<a id='f115a4a5-48e8-4612-bde7-78d91ab4734f'></a>\n\n**B. Enalapril**\n\n1. Has longer elimination half-life compared to captopril, so it can be dosed daily or two times daily.\n2. An IV formulation of enalapril is available.\n3.

Beta Blockers\n\nA. Esmolol\n\n1. Short-acting beta-1 antagonist. Used to treat systemic hypertension after coarctation of the aorta repair, to reduce dynamic right- or left-sided outflow tract obstruction (e.g., Tetralogy of Fallot or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), and tachyarrhythmias (supraventricular tachycardias).\n2. Adverse effects include bradycardia, hypotension, and bronchospasm.\n3. This drug should be used with caution in patients with decreased ventricular function, when calcium channel blockers are being used, and avoided in bradycardia or atrioventricular (AV) block.\n\nB. Labetalol\n\n1. Alpha and beta blocker that is used in treatment of systemic hypertension. Adverse effects are the same as for esmolol.\n\n<a id='16256b1b-6f55-4adc-93ac-43c52d9667aa'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Propranolol\n\n1. Used to treat arrhythmias (atrial flutter and fibrillation, A-V node re-entrant tachycardias), hypertension, Tetralogy \"spells\" (hypercyanotic episodes), and hypertrophic subaortic stenosis.\n2. Adverse effects include hypotension, impaired myocardial contractility, congestive heart failure, bradycardia, worsening of AV conduction disturbances, hypoglycemia (especially in young patients), agranulocytosis, and bronchospasm.\n3. Drug interactions include phenobarbital, rifampin, cimetidine, aluminum-containing antacids and phenothiazines.\n\n<a id='a680cb2d-e690-4fcd-a945-a06447b0b15d'></a>\n\nVIII. **Agents that Affect the Ductus Arteriosus**\n\nA. Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1)\n\n1. PGE1 use in certain lesions can lead to deterioration. These include obstructive Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Return (blood flow can be shunted away from the lungs via the PDA causing worse cyanosis) and Tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia and collaterals (maintaining a PDA plus the collaterals can cause over-circulation to the lungs), though may have some role in the initial acute management.\n2. Adverse effects include apnea (dose-related), hyperthermia, cutaneous flushing, hypotension and seizures. Prolonged use (greater than 2 wks) has been associated with antral hypertrophy and gastric outlet obstruction. Less common side effects are cortical hyperostosis and soft tissue swelling\n\n<a id='5579dc10-d0d4-4dcb-bceb-3eef238fd230'></a>\n\nB. Indomethacin\n\n1. Inhibits cyclo-oxygenase, which is a key enzyme in prostaglandin synthesis, thus helping to close the PDA in patients with a persistent PDA that does not close spontaneously.\n2. Contraindications include an elevated BUN and creatinine, and thrombocytopenia.\n3. Adverse effects include reduced renal function and urine output, decreased platelet production and decreased cerebral blood flow.\n\n<a id='be7715af-5b60-4885-946a-00bd161c82a2'></a>\n\nIX. Anticoagulants\n\nA. Heparin\n\n1. A glycosaminoglycuran that accelerates the process in which factors X, IX, XI, and XIII as well as thrombin associate with antithrombin III and are metabolized in the reticuloendothelial system.\n2. Indications include prophylaxis against thrombosis (e.g., systemic-pulmonary artery shunts) and treatment of deep vein thrombosis or femoral artery thrombosis.\n3. Treatment goal typically is to maintain the partial thromboplastin time (PTT) 1.5-2.5 times normal and Heparin activity level between 0.3-0.7.\n4. Bleeding due to excessive heparin effect can be reversed by protamine sulfate (1 mg/100 units of heparin).\n\n<a id='486f18e5-d522-4937-831c-f1df1babf99c'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Adverse effects include gastritis, gastric ulcer and gastrointestinal bleeding.\n\n<a id='e4d1dfd1-b425-4f4f-b397-b16f88c37831'></a>\n\nX. **Thrombolytic Agents**\n\nA. **Tissue-Type Plasminogen Activator (TPA)**\n\n1. Activates plasminogen to plasmin in the presence of fibrin. It is different from urokinase and streptokinase as it does not have much effect on fibrinogen and has less systemic effects. Mostly used in treatment of adult myocardial infarction patients. Also used in treatment for coronary arterial thrombosis in Kawasaki disease, Blalock-Taussing shunts, femoral arterial occlusion after cardiac catheterization, right atrial thrombus associated with central venous catheters, and vena caval thrombosis.\n\n<a id='ebcef8f4-7d6c-44e0-b924-401694384275'></a>\n\nXI. **Digoxin**\n\nA. Increases the availability of intracellular calcium for myocardial contraction. Used for myocardial dysfunction as well as an antiarrhythmic agent. Contraindicated in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\n\nB. **Toxicity:**\n1. Digoxin toxicity can occur at serum level > 2 ng/ml.\n2. Increased incidence of toxic effects with hypokalemia and following calcium bolus dose.\n3. Decrease dosing with simultaneous use of quinidine, verapamil, or amiodarone.\n\nC. **Side effects:** bradycardia, atrioventricular block, ventricular arrhythmias and tachycardia.\n\n<a id='3992eb32-42e2-4636-bd44-de38f31f7a42'></a>\n\n## XII.

Arrhythmia\n\nOverall fairly uncommon in the neonatal population other than sinus arrhythmia, isolated premature atrial contractions (PACs) and isolated premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). The normal pacemaker of the heart is the sinus node, with the AV node and the ventricle as two other potential pacemaker sites. These pacemaker sites have lower rates than the sinus node, however they will take over if the sinus node slows or fails. Complexes generated from the ventricle usually will be wider than those from the atria since the cells initially depolarize cell to cell rather than fully through the His-purkinje system.\n\n<a id='f4f33277-2d43-4b96-9858-0745545e8d50'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Tachycardias originating in the atrium\n\n1. Atrial tachycardia\n\nTachycardia that originates in the atria. Reentrant tachycardias are more commonly found in neonates than automatic tachycardias. Atrial tachycardias are often narrow complex as the impulse depolarizes utilizing the His-purkinje system. If part of the His-Purkinje System is refractory when the signal arrives, the tachycardia may be wide complex (aberrancy)\n\na. Reentrant supraventricular tachycardia - most commonly caused by an accessory pathway, e.g. Wolff Parkinson White. Regular rate, break the circuit with vagal maneuvers, adenosine or DC cardioversion. If atrial wires are in place, can overdrive atrial pace to break the circuit. Medications for control include propranolol and digoxin (though digoxin avoided in patients with WPW)\n\n<::ECG strip illustrating reentrant supraventricular tachycardia\n: chart::>\n\nb. Ectopic atrial tachycardia - Automatic focus within the atria. Irregular, does not usually break with adenosine or DC cardioversion as there is no circuit to interrupt. Consider administering sedation to decrease catecholamines during initial management. Medical management includes amiodarone, propranolol and digoxin. Multifocal atrial tachycardia has multiple automatic foci with different pwave morphologies.\n\n<::ECG strip illustrating ectopic atrial tachycardia\n: chart::>\n\nc. AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) - less commonly found in neonates, reentrant tachycardia within the AV node. Pwaves not usually seen.\n\nd. Atrial flutter - Reentrant tachycardia around the tricuspid valve, depending on how often the signal travels through the AV node and down the His-Purkinje System will have variable conduction (2:1, 3:1, 4:1, etc). Using adenosine will block the AV node and demonstrate more clearly the underlying atrial flutter. Can utilize DC cardioversion or overdrive pacing to break the circuit.\n\n<::ECG strip illustrating atrial flutter\n: chart::>\n\ne.

Tachycardias originating in the ventricle\n\n1. Ventricular tachycardia/Ventricular fibrillation - tachycardia that originates from myocytes or purkinje cells below the bifurcation of the bundle of his. Can degenerate into ventricular fibrillation. Monomorphic VT has uniform QRS complexes while polymorphic VT has varying QRS complexes. If patient unconscious or unstable, utilize cardioversion (0.5-1 J/kg) synchronized (if organized and sufficient amplitude) or unsynchronized (if VF or rapid polymorphic VT). If stable, may consider IV lidocaine. Medication control includes propranolol.\n\n<::An ECG strip showing a regular, wide-complex tachycardia, labeled \"Monomorphic VT\".\n: figure::>\n\n2.

The ductus is usually functionally closed within 12 hrs of life. Anatomic closure normally occurs within 10 days. In the premature infant, closure often will not occur until term.\n\nB. Left-to-right shunting through the ductus may contribute to increasing pulmonary edema, persistent need for ventilator support, and the development of BPD. Decreased systemic perfusion to end organs like brain, kidney, and intestines may also occur. These potential complications have traditionally been the motivation to achieve ductal closure.\n\nC. It remains unclear if treatment of a PDA results in improved long-term outcomes. Recent analyses have shown that treatment of a PDA does NOT reduce the common complications of prematurity including death, BPD, IVH, or NEC1. Risks of medical or surgical closure also exist. Therefore, determination of the hemodynamic significance of the PDA in a particular patient is essential in decision making until further evidence from clinical studies can be acquired to guide optimal treatment.\n\n<a id='6742de62-384d-47dc-b92c-5adb2f802a55'></a>\n\nII. **Diagnosis**\n\nA. **Clinical Signs and Symptoms**\n\nSuspect a hemodynamically significant PDA in premature infants when there is:\n\n1.  A systolic or continuous \"grating\" murmur heard in the LUSB.\n2.  Bounding pulses (often palmar pulses are palpated).\n3.  Wide pulse pressure (>20 mmHg) with low diastolic pressure.\n4.  Difficulty weaning from the ventilator (above what is expected for typical RDS picture). Increased PaCO2 may be the only finding.\n5.  CHF, cardiomegaly, and pulmonary edema visible on CXR.\n6.  Metabolic acidosis.\n7.  Feeding intolerance\n8.  Oliguria, rising creatinine levels\n\n**NOTE**: Sometimes a PDA is asymptomatic\n\n<a id='52511ebb-c17e-4b18-8276-80994f076c6d'></a>\n\nB. Echocardiographic Findings\n\nConfirmation of clinical suspicion is by echocardiogram:\n\n1. ECHO characteristics to consider include size of the duct, direction of blood flow (left-to-right, bidirectional), and other indicators of hemodynamic significance such as elevated left atrial to aortic root regurgitation.\n2. The ECHO will only capture a moment in time. As the PDA is dynamic, multiple ECHO studies may be necessary for clinical correlation.\n\n<a id='c000ca75-fcc8-4dd9-8960-e576c27e4157'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Surgical Management:\n\n1. For those with failed medical management or with contraindications to indomethacin, surgical ligation at the bedside by the CV Surgery team may be indicated.\n2. It is recommended that surgical ligation be delayed until the infant is at least 30 days of age. The decision for surgical ligation should be made after Cardiology consultation. Catheter-based closure may be an option for older infants.\n3. Consider need for stress-dose hydrocortisone prior to surgery. Infants are at risk for impaired cerebral autoregulation in the 6 hours following ligation. ³\n4. Complications of surgical ligation include risks of anesthesia, vocal cord paralysis, pneumothorax, myocardial dysfunction, infection, and bleeding.

Background\n\nDespite changes in the nature and epidemiology of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), patients with BPD are more likely to develop pulmonary hypertension (PH) than those without, and the morbidity and mortality associated with PH in this population remains high. Even in the \"post-surfactant era,\" in severe cases of late PH mortality rates near 70% are reported. PH also contributes to the cardiopulmonary abnormalities seen in BPD patients, including decreased right ventricular (RV) function, reduced cardiac output, limited oxygen delivery, and increased pulmonary edema. Moreover, PH affects the development of the lung circulation in BPD patients, leading to persistent abnormal lung growth via a reduction in number (impaired angiogenesis) and an altered pattern of distribution of small pulmonary arteries within the lung interstitium. The arterial tree has increased vascular tone and has undergone hypertensive remodeling. In this population, reduced alveolarization along with the simplification of the distal lung airspaces results in a decreased overall alveolar-capillary surface area. PH has a significant effect on the clinical course of BPD due to these effects on lung development. Patients develop elevated pulmonary vascular resistance and abnormal vasoreactivity, as demonstrated by their marked vasoconstrictor response to acute hypoxia, which persists late into the course of the disease. They also often have a prolonged need for oxygen and ventilator therapy. During respiratory infections or exercise, they can have profound hypoxemia; likewise, relatively minor amounts of right to left shunting can lead to significant hemodynamic compromise.\n\n<a id='b8bcc791-43f9-494e-94de-99b53b3e3564'></a>\n\n## II. Evaluation and Diagnosis\n\nA. Diagnosis of PH can be difficult in BPD patients given the subtle symptoms and the overlap with signs consistent with primary respiratory abnormalities. Early detection, though, may provide important prognostic information as well as allow for early aggressive therapy to improve late outcomes. Unfortunately, little data exists regarding the incidence and natural history of PH in BPD patients and PH in the setting of BPD is ill-defined. Echocardiography remains the best non-invasive screening tool for PH, but in the absence of tricuspid regurgitation, is not a reliable estimate of pulmonary artery pressure. In such cases, severity of PH may be estimated using qualitative findings, such as flattening of the interventricular septum, presence of shunts, evidence of pulmonary venous obstruction, and LV and RV size and function.\n\n<a id='4a086208-f1bc-4803-845a-aee1cfec9abe'></a>\n\n**B. Recommendations at this time for PH screening are:**\n\n1. Early screening echocardiograms can be performed as early as 7-10 days of age in premature infants with:\n   a. Severe respiratory distress syndrome (RDS)\n   b. High levels of ventilator support and oxygen need\n   c. Oligohydramnios\n   d. Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR)\n   e. Slow rate of clinical improvement (ie, persistent or progressively increased need for respiratory support)\n\n<a id='6ced4069-ab0f-46c5-9813-696ffd856399'></a>\n\n2. Screening echocardiogram at 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA) if:\n\n<a id='50526bd2-b12e-4308-8b37-ef5168a945a8'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

On positive pressure ventilation\nb. Not consistently weaning from supplemental oxygen\nc. Oxygen needs disproportionate to level of lung disease\nd. Recurrent cyanotic episodes\n\n<a id='c9624a55-908c-4c08-b162-0d02eb648d0d'></a>\n\n3. Other indications that warrant a screening echocardiogram:\n   a. Feeding dysfunction\n   b. Poor growth\n   c. Recurrent hospitalizations\n   d. Elevated PaCO2\n   e. Persistent pulmonary edema requiring frequent use of diuretics\n\n<a id='e3db3612-1e1b-45f9-ba94-0911ef92a284'></a>\n\nC. If the patient is clinically stable and the echocardiogram is normal or shows subtle signs of mild PH, serial echocardiograms are recommended every 1-2 months while hospitalized and on oxygen therapy (if outpatient, can be obtained every 2-4 months) and again within 2 months of being weaned off oxygen.\n\n<a id='e9297ecf-3a40-4abf-8527-2e70d1b641b2'></a>\n\nD. For patients whose echocardiograms show signs of PH, the Pulmonary Hypertension team should be consulted and may initially recommend serial echocardiograms every 1-2 weeks. Cardiac catheterization and/or high resolution chest CT may be appropriate if patients:\n\n1. Have persistent signs of cardiopulmonary disease or clinical deterioration not related to airway disease.\n2. Are suspected of having significant PH despite optimal management of lung disease and associated complications.\n3. Are a candidate for prolonged PH drug therapy\n4. Have unexplained and recurrent pulmonary edema\n\n<a id='9b8d3dcb-c79d-4b7e-827d-f80667bd99c6'></a>\n\nE. Goals of advanced imaging:\n\n1. Exclude or document the severity of associated anatomic cardiac lesions, including the presence of intracardiac shunts or pulmonary artery stenosis\n\n2. Define the presence of systemic-pulmonary collateral vessels (including their size), pulmonary venous obstruction (e.g. pulmonary vein stenosis), or left heart dysfunction. Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction can lead to recurrent pulmonary edema and poor response to inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) therapy.\n\n3. Obtain a structural assessment of the pulmonary arterial and venous circulations by angiography\n\n4. Assess the severity of PH\n\n5. Assess pulmonary vascular reactivity in patients who fail to respond to oxygen therapy alone. Acute vasoreactivity testing should be performed to determine the patient's response to vasodilating agents (iNO 20-40 ppm while on 100% FiO2 oxygen), possibly establishing targeted therapy for the patient and\n\n<a id='297ac9f2-8772-45ff-951b-97ee0f7853cb'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Sleep studies, flexible bronchoscopy, upper gastrointestinal series, pH probe/impedance studies, and/or swallow studies may be indicated to evaluate for chronic reflux, aspiration, structural airway abnormalities, bronchoreactivity, and lung edema.\n2. Oxygen saturations should be in the target range of 92-95%.\n\n<a id='c97b57de-e15e-4f2e-9e20-05542e8f49ec'></a>\n\nB. Inhaled Nitric Oxide (iNO)\n\n1. Causes selective pulmonary vasodilation\n2. Acute improvement in pulmonary hemodynamics has been demonstrated during cardiac catheterization. Long term, low-dose therapy has not been fully studied, but early work has shown that doses as low as 2 ppm can normalize pulmonary pressures more effectively than calcium channel blockers. Lower doses (2-10 ppm) may further enhance ventilation-perfusion mismatch, allowing for improved oxygenation at lower FiO2.\n3. Starting dose: 10-20 ppm\n\n<a id='30ebc68f-170f-407e-ad9e-336662d6aa3d'></a>\n\n## C. Sildenafil\n\n1. Highly selective phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor, leading to increased cyclic GMP contents in vascular smooth muscle\n2. Data in children are limited, but includes studies showing improvement of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) and of older children undergoing long-term therapy. However, studies in non-BPD pediatric populations have shown highly variable absorption and efficacy. It may be helpful in augmenting the effect of iNO and/or facilitating the weaning off iNO.\n3. Starting dose: 0.5 mg/kg/dose q8h. If no systemic hypotension develops, dose can be increased to a maximum of 1 mg/kg/dose q8h.\n\n<a id='c83f3bf9-7ae4-4577-a7bf-044477b32ea9'></a>\n\nD. Endothelin-Receptor Antagonists (Bosentan)\n\n1. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a potent vasoconstrictor and smooth muscle mitogen that has been linked to the pathogenesis of PH in term infants with PPHN and CDH, as well as premature infants with RDS.\n2. Bosentan acts as an antagonist to the receptor of ET-1, thereby inhibiting vasoconstriction. It has been shown to be safe and effective in children as young as 9 months, but its use in BPD is limited to case studies.\n3. Starting dose: 1 mg/kg/dose BID. Increase to 2 mg/kg/dose BID after 2-4 weeks if no changes in liver function tests. Monitor liver function tests monthly.\n\n<a id='99e8deef-a0bb-424d-adc0-31047d48a7e4'></a>\n\nE. Prostacyclin Therapy\n\n1.

It can be delivered as a continuous intravenous or subcutaneous (subQ) infusion. For subcutaneous delivery, a catheter is inserted in the subQ tissue with the infusion administered via a dedicated infusion (CADD MS-3) pump. It can be nebulized with a manufacturer-specific delivery system and, more recently, is available in an oral formulation for adult patients.\nb. Has been shown to be effective in older pediatric patient populations, but like epoprostenol, can potentially worsen V-Q mismatch in the BPD population.\nc. Has been shown to be as effective as epoprostenol over 5 years (in a non-BPD population). BPD data are unavailable.\nd. Starting dose and delivery system: Consult Pulmonary Hypertension team\n\n<a id='e5c3c69e-3b34-4874-a2ea-cdb9593dd789'></a>\n\nF. Monitoring while on vasodilator therapy\n\n1. Serial echocardiograms every 4 weeks during acute initiation of therapy; sooner if signs/symptoms of clinical worsening\n2. Echocardiograms every 6 months with stable disease\n3. Brain natriuretic peptide levels (BNP) may be a helpful biomarker to follow during long-term therapy\n4. If sudden clinical deterioration, worsening of PH by echocardiogram, or when echocardiography is inadequate, cardiac catheterization may need to be repeated to evaluate for development of pulmonary vein stenosis or veno-occlusive disease, if noncompliance has been ruled out.\n\n<a id='12e9da0e-88e2-4d39-a155-e290a85d3e33'></a>\n\nG.

The Gann Act and Informed Consent\n\nA. What is the Gann Act?\n\n1. The Paul Gann Blood Safety Act (Health and Safety Code Section 1645) requires that physicians or nurse practitioners provide patients with a state-produced handout, \"A Patient's Guide to Blood Transfusions,” whenever there is the possibility that a blood transfusion will be necessary. This handout describes the risks and benefits of autologous, designated (also known as directed), and non-designated allogeneic blood donations. This brochure should be given in addition to having the parent or guardian sign informed consent.\n\n<a id='37f1a72a-247d-4a87-ab7d-194b92f80547'></a>\n\nB. Who should be notified?\n\n1.  Parents whose children are in the NICU receive a general information packet upon admission from either the bedside nurse or the unit clerk. Within this packet is a letter explaining the possible need for blood product transfusion, the types of transfusion, as well as options for directed donation.\n2.  The Gann Act should be discussed with parents of infants with a reasonable likelihood of requiring a transfusion. If an infant has a low likelihood for needing blood products (e.g., rule-out sepsis patients), the Gann Act does not need to be discussed.\n3.  In the case of an emergency transfusion, the Gann Act does not apply, but if further transfusions are anticipated, the above procedure should be followed\n\n<a id='d64cf7d8-cf4a-4f11-8db1-143ae8a76566'></a>\n\nC. Documentation of the Gann Act and Informed Consent\n\n1. The Physician, Nurse Practitioner or Transport Specialist who makes first contact with the parents/guardian should inform them about the possibility of transfusion and provide them with the written information about blood product transfusion.\n2. This may not be possible in the case of infants transported in from outside hospitals with an outside transport team. The physician or nurse practitioner should then provide parents with the written information when they arrive in our NICU.\n3. The provider must document in EPIC (\"Order Transfusion Consent & Gann Act\") the date they obtained consent for blood transfusion and that the Gann Act was provided and discussed with the patient/parent/guardian. If not already done, the consent order and Gann Act order will be displayed at the time of the first blood product order and mandatory for the provider to complete. The consent order and Gann Act order are required once per admission for all patients. Except for emergencies, written consent must also be obtained from a parent prior to transfusion and this paper consent should be placed in the infant's chart\n\n<a id='266684b4-8244-4704-82bd-fbbaaff032f3'></a>\n\n## II. Blood Product Information\n\n### A. General information\n\n1. Blood products must be ordered via EPIC, most commonly in the General Blood Administration Order set.\n2. The patient's ABO/Rh type and antibody screen are required prior to receiving cross-matched blood products. ABO/Rh typing must be performed on two separate blood draws on two separate occasions in\n\n<a id='6440e0c8-7e83-4564-b321-69009780e0c2'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital. No representations or warranties are made for outside use. Not for outside reproduction or publication without permission.\n\n<a id='674b5fa0-c4e1-4645-a4ad-09939b4d0bff'></a>\n\n### Blood Product Ordering and Transfusion Practices 227\n\norder to confirm the ABO type to prevent ABO incompatible transfusion from misidentification errors. All infants admitted to the NICU should have an initial ABO/Rh sent with the first blood draw performed for other clinical indications (note: if labs are not indicated, there is no need to send an ABO/Rh). For patients who may need blood product components, ABO/Rh type must be verified by a second sample drawn at a separate time. Historical typing performed at LPCH will meet the requirement for 1 of the 2 ABO/Rh types (though this is an unlikely circumstance for the majority of NICU admissions).\n\n<a id='30f35edb-5edb-4a61-93ec-19cbf8dd9cfe'></a>\n\n3. All cellular blood products (red blood cells and platelets) for newborn < 4 months are irradiated and leukoreduced. Additionally, premature infants <35 weeks gestation receive CMV negative products. The attributes of the blood products are automatically chosen based on patient diagnosis (see below).\n\n4. The patient's diagnosis should be indicated in the order. The required \"Comorbidity\" entry is typically a newborn <4 months, but additional comorbidities may be present, depending on the individual clinical situation (e.g., ECMO <4 months). The provider must chose multiple co-morbidities if applicable. The volume of blood product component must be entered separately in both the nursing \"order to transfuse\" and blood product order.\n\n5. When blood products are needed within one hour of the order, place the order STAT.\n\n6. In case of an extreme emergency, providers should order uncrossmatched blood via the Emergency Release Blood Product order set in EPIC and a phone call notifying the Transfusion Service Charge Tech (723-6445) should be made. A runner must be sent to the Transfusion Service with the correct patient label to pick up the emergency blood products.\n\n7. For blood ordering practices for ECMO, see NICU Guide Section II.B.6 \"ECMO”.\n\n<a id='43f5227b-af09-4cf2-b407-05b8af95be78'></a>\n\nB. Packed red blood cells (PRBCs)\n\n1. Patients typically receive 10-15 mL/kg PBRCs depending on the starting and target hematocrits. Patients usually receive type-specific blood, and always ABO compatible even in the case of uncrossmatched emergencies. The blood may be infused over 1-4 hrs as determined by the hemodynamic status of the patient. PRBCs expire 4 hours after they are issued from the Transfusion Service. Consider administration of a diuretic following transfusion in fluid-sensitive patients.\n2. Potassium leaks from PRBCs during storage, especially after irradiation. The amount of free potassium in a small aliquot (10-15 mL/kg) PRBC transfusion is not clinically significant. In the case of massive transfusion or in patients with reduced ability to handle potassium (e.g., renal failure, acidosis), transient hyperkalemia may occur and washing of cells is appropriate if fresh RBC units less than 10 days old are not available. Please call the Transfusion Service or page the Transfusion Service physician at 12027 to assist with ordering of washed PRBCs if indicated.\n3. The hematocrit of PRBC transfusions is approximately 55-60%. Occasionally, \"dry\" PRBCs are indicated to limit the volume of incompatible plasma infused. These \"dry packed units\" have a hematocrit of approximately 85% and require dilution with normal saline prior to use. Instructions for dilution are sent attached to the \"dry packed\" PRBCs from the Transfusion Service.\n4. Indications for PRBC transfusion are patient-specific. In general, the need for transfusion increases with respiratory or cardiac instability. Please discuss transfusion indications with the Attending.\n\n<a id='ea412720-8c28-495c-ba01-8c483406a515'></a>\n\nC. **Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and plasma frozen within 24 hrs (FP24)**\n\n1. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is plasma frozen within 6-8 hrs of collection. It contains all coagulant factors as well as albumin and immunoglobulins. Plasma frozen within 24 hrs (FP24) is approved by the FDA and AABB and can be used interchangeably with FFP. In North America, FP24 has largely replaced FFP.\n\n<a id='aeeed01d-1e00-4a7a-ad26-fb6dfdb886e4'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital. No representations or warranties are made for outside use. Not for outside reproduction or publication without permission.\n\n<a id='b8939f20-5615-4994-83c3-246519d8342d'></a>\n\n228 Part II-D: Hematology\n\n2. FFP and FP24 are free of leukocytes, RBCs, and platelets. ABO-compatible plasma must be used. Remember, AB plasma (not O) is the universally compatible plasma product.\n3. The usual dose of FFP or F24 is 10-15 mL/kg over 30 min, though longer infusion times are permissible.\n4. The indications for FFP include DIC, liver disease and therapeutic plasma exchange.\n\n<a id='c5e3640a-b90f-4a92-830c-fdf9f73d05d3'></a>\n\nD. Platelets\n\n1. Platelets are available in \"apheresis\" units only at Stanford. Each apheresis unit is equivalent to 6 random donor pooled platelets (which are not available at Stanford). A whole apheresis unit is approximately 250 mL. Platelets are ordered by volume, not units, in the neonatal population (10-15 mL/kg). For a volume less than 90 ml, a syringe aliquot (10-90 ml) will be prepared in the transfusion service. Platelets expire 4 hours after issue and are infused over 30-60 minutes.\n\n2. In some cases, only ABO-incompatible platelets will be available. If more than 15 mL of platelets are ordered, they will be \"packed\" by the Transfusion Service to reduce the amount of ABO-incompatible plasma given to the patient. Transfusion Service will place a sticker on the bag indicating that the volume of platelets transfused should not exceed 5 mL/kg. It is an acceptable clinical decision, however, to transfuse more than 5mL/kg of ABO-incompatible platelets in a patient who needs more platelets.\n\n3. The threshold for platelet transfusion varies according to the patient's clinical situation. Examples of appropriate indications include any infant with active bleeding, a premature infant at risk for intracranial hemorrhage or any infant at risk for post-operative bleeding. Please discuss patient-specific transfusion indications with the Attending.\n\n<a id='24cfbfa8-2be0-4919-84c2-e1ff528a901b'></a>\n\nE. Cryoprecipitate AHF (Cryo)\n\n1.  Cryoprecipitate AHF (anti-hemophilic factor) contains fibrinogen, factor VIII (8), von Willebrand's factor, factor XIII (13), and fibronectin. The primary clinical indication for transfusion with cryo is hypofibrinogenemia (fibrinogen <150).\n2.  Cryo is supplied in units of 10-15 mL. Neonates receive 1 unit per 10kg of body weight never to exceed 10 units (the adult dose), infused over 30 minutes. Most neonates only require 1 unit. Transfusion Services will provide ABO-compatible cryo if possible, though it is not required to be ABO-compatible.\n\n<a id='a8f70d1e-3af4-40ae-83f0-3c9054e9ea4a'></a>\n\nIII. Types of donated blood\n\nA. Autologous donation\n\nAutologous donation occurs in the setting of anticipated transfusion, where an adult donates in advance of a planned surgical procedure. This circumstance is not applicable to the NICU setting.\n\nB. Community donation\n\nBlood products (all blood types and components) are donated by volunteers who are not paid. All donors are screened with a questionnaire and the blood is tested for the following: ABO/Rh type, CMV, antibody to Hepatitis C, Hepatitis B surface antigen, antibody to Hepatitis B core protein, antibody to HIV, antibody to HTLV-I/II, and antibody to Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite that causes Chagas Disease. Pooled donor specimens are also tested for Hepatitis C, HIV, and West Nile Virus RNA and Hepatitis B DNA (nucleic acid testing or NAT).\n\n<a id='8495ccb2-1e20-49d4-9138-70938c449ed7'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Directed donation\n\n1.  Directed donation comes from a qualified donor who is a parent or other person chosen by the family. Studies indicate that directed donors have similar or higher rates of infectious disease markers compared to volunteer donors. Therefore, directed blood is NOT safer than volunteer blood. A possible reason for this discrepancy is that directed donors may feel under pressure to donate and may not admit to risk factors. For this reason, parents should not be pressured to provide directed donors on behalf of their child. There may also be circumstances where directed blood is not appropriate due to HLA-sensitization issues (e.g., anticipated organ transplant from a family member).\n\n2.  Directed donations require a written order from a physician or nurse practitioner. A physician/NNP may place an order by faxing a written order to the Special Donations Department at the Stanford Blood Center (fax 650-723-8155). The intended donor must contact Special Donations (phone 650-723-6667) to make an appointment to donate. Please see the website bloodcenter.stanford.edu to obtain the order form and for more information.\n\n3.  Order \"CMV negative\" (i.e., CMV antibody negative) blood for the following infants: <35 weeks gestation, infants with suspected severe immunodeficiency (e.g. DiGeorge, SCID), infants born to mothers with HIV infection and infants with complex congenital heart disease.\n\n**NOTE**: Only about 50% of donors will be CMV antibody negative. If \"CMV negative\" is required for an infant receiving a directed donation, and the donor is found to be CMV antibody positive, the unit will NOT be used for the infant.\n\nNormal full-term infants do not require CMV antibody negative blood components. All directed donations will be leukoreduced, which reduces the risk of CMV transmission.\n\n<a id='fd1f3244-857f-46ac-95b4-212a3e389ce3'></a>\n\n4. Considerations\n\na. The shelf life of directed units may be shorter than units from community donors because all directed units are irradiated. The shelf life is limited to 28 days or less if the directed units need to be manipulated because of plasma incompatibility.\n\nb. A mother may be permitted to donate red blood cells on behalf of her child if her hemoglobin is high enough and her obstetrician provides written authorization.\n\nc. All directed donors including the mother must be screened carefully with questions about risk factors as well as blood testing for infectious diseases. About 15% of individuals presenting to donate do not meet donor eligibility criteria.\n\nd. Individuals with a history of pregnancy or transfusion are not permitted to donate plasma products (FFP, FP24 and platelets). This includes mothers of newborn infants. This policy was put in place by the FDA to reduce the incidence of Transfusion Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI), now the most common cause of transfusion-related fatality. TRALI is often associated with donor antibodies to WBC antigens (HLA and granulocyte antigens); these antibodies are most commonly induced by pregnancy.\n\n<a id='efa225ca-d53d-435e-a110-556f6b53c748'></a>\n\nIV. **Transfusion Reactions**\n\nA. Transfusion reactions are extremely rare in newborns. Symptoms of a transfusion reaction may include fever, respiratory distress, hypotension, and acidosis.\nB. In the event of any clinical problems during a blood transfusion, discontinue the transfusion, fill out a \"Possible Transfusion Reaction Report,\" and return the unit to the Transfusion Service.\n\n<a id='443d9f8f-e409-4da6-8277-10101ddc6a50'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Factors that place these infants at risk include: disordered bilirubin-albumin binding, starvation, and/or decreased enteral intake leading to decreased gastrointestinal (GI) activity resulting in increased enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin. Contributing physiologic conditions include: a damaged blood-brain barrier, asphyxia, acidosis, and hypoalbuminemia. Thus, bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction or BIND may occur at lower total serum/plasma bilirubin (TB) levels than those for term and healthy infants. DO NOT SUBTRACT THE DIRECT BILIRUBIN VALUE FROM THE TB LEVEL TO CALCULATE THE INDIRECT BILIRUBIN VALUE FOR CLINICAL DECISIONS UNLESS DIRECT BILIRUBIN IS >50% OF TB.\n\n<a id='a0cdb78e-2f12-4646-9de5-37c1328a0161'></a>\n\nA.

Clinical Manifestations\n\nJaundice can be detected by using digital pressure to blanch the skin at the forehead, sternum, iliac crest, patella, or malleolus to reveal the underlying skin and subcutaneous tissue color. Jaundice should be assessed whenever the infant's vital signs are being measured, but no less than every 8 to 12 hrs. The assessment of visible jaundice must be done in a well-lit room or, preferably, in daylight with ambient sunlight. The degree of jaundice can vary in color from lemon yellow to bright orange and sienna. Accuracy of assessment may be limited by an infant's skin pigmentation, plethora, and previous exposure to sun or phototherapy as well as decreased ambient light during assessment. It must be remembered that the absence of jaundice is not an indication of the absence of hyperbilirubinemia. In addition, estimating the degree of hyperbilirubinemia can lead to errors. The absence or severity of jaundice is not predictive of subsequent severe hyperbilirubinemia\n\n<a id='dc14fda1-15d0-413f-b053-ed0a24651068'></a>\n\na. Onset of jaundice in first 24 hrs of life should be considered a sign of an excessive rate of rise of TB and an indication for STAT TB level and further evaluation.\nb. Jaundice is usually observed first in the face and then caudally in the trunk and extremities. It can sometimes appear and fade similar to a tan.\n\n<a id='39114c99-17e3-4c6a-b3f0-03de22a88901'></a>\n\nB. Testing\n\nTB is measured in the serum or plasma. In term and late preterm infants, the TB level can be plotted on the Bhutani nomogram to identify the infant's percentile risk zone in combination with assessment of clinical risk factors. The Bhutani nomogram provides a more appropriate understanding of the magnitude of the hyperbilirubinemia and a projected TB ROR as a function of postnatal age (in hrs) as defined for healthy infants. A transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) measurement is a noninvasive alternative to a TB measurement. TcB devices are useful screening tools and provide a valid estimate of TB levels (up to 12.5 mg/dL), although data are limited\n\n<a id='e2b8b123-1975-4c79-b7ff-dc63b3f66331'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Effective Phototherapy\n\n1. Background Information\n\n**THIS MODE OF TREATMENT DOES NOT EMIT UV LIGHT**\n\nThe optimal light source is blue light within a narrow range wavelength (460-490 nm; such as that provided by blue light-emitting diodes [LEDs]) that is distributed evenly to one plane of the body (and can be increased to both ventral and dorsal planes or even, circumferential) at an irradiance of >30 to <35 µW/cm²/nm in infants > 28 wks GA. Photodegradation of bilirubin by blue light exposure is almost immediate and may not reflect measured TB levels. Multiple light sources are available to cover a wider surface area with a uniform footprint of irradiance. Avoid shadows with multiple lights and other interferences for optimal light exposure. Avoid exposure to UV lights (such as fluorescent tubes).\n\n<a id='e34478c4-2525-4f7f-96b0-b95569b173d8'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Because the baby will be unwrapped to maximize skin exposure to light, heat lamps may be needed to maintain temperature.\n\n<a id='b92d4083-62f1-4263-8b20-643a9ee2c514'></a>\n\nTable 4: Considerations for a \"Crash-Cart\" Approach\n<table id=\"44-1\">\n<tr><td id=\"44-2\">Options</td><td id=\"44-3\">Identify the most effective means to minimize brain damage</td></tr>\n<tr><td id=\"44-4\">Risk</td><td id=\"44-5\">Weigh against the potential risk of ABE versus exchange transfusion</td></tr>\n<tr><td id=\"44-6\">Pre-treatment</td><td id=\"44-7\">Start total body phototherapy (while procedures are being done) Consider IVIG for isoimmunization Consider albumin infusion (1 g/kg) for hypoalbuminemia (< 3.4 g/dL)</td></tr>\n<tr><td id=\"44-8\">Procedure</td><td id=\"44-9\">Isovolume double volume exchange (170 mL/kg in term, 190 mL/kg in preterm infants)</td></tr>\n<tr><td id=\"44-a\">Duration</td><td id=\"44-b\">May be accomplished within 3 to 4 hrs (consent, labs, lines, and procedures)</td></tr>\n<tr><td id=\"44-c\">Technical problems</td><td id=\"44-d\">A single volume exchange transfusion may be adequate until technical problems are resolved.</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<a id='c882dbde-eee2-4458-807e-0781f1df4b2c'></a>\n\nD. Management of Hyperbilirubinemia in Sick and Preterm Infants\n\nThe primary strategy for clinical management of sick and preterm infants is prevention. Jaundice should be monitored along with other vital signs. TB measurements should be done every 8 to 12 hrs; can be decreased to every 12 to 24 hrs if infant is under phototherapy, when TB levels are decreasing, or when the infant is beyond 1 wk of age.

During birth hospitalization exchange transfusion is recommended if TSB rises to these levels despite intensive phototherapy. For readmitted infants, if TSB is above exchange level, repeat TSB every 2-3hrs and consider exchange if TSB remains above levels indicated after intensive phototherapy for 6 hours.\n\n<::transcription of the content\n: chart::>\n\n*   The dashed lines for the first 24 hours indicate uncertainty due to a wide range of clinical circumstances and a range of responses to phototherapy.\n*   Immediate exchange transfusion is recommended if infant shows signs of acute bilirubin encephalopathy (hypertonia, arching, retrocollis, opisthotonos, fever, high pitched cry) or if TSB is ≥5mg/dL (85µmol/L) above these lines.\n*   Risk factors - isoimmune hemolytic disease, G6PD deficiency, asphyxia, significant lethargy, temperature instability, sepsis, acidosis.\n*   Measure serum albumin and calculate B/A ratio (See legend)\n*   Use total bilirubin. Do not subtract direct reacting or conjugated bilirubin\n*   If infant is well and 35-37 6/7 wk (median risk) can individualize TSB levels for exchange based on actual gestational age.\n\n<a id='985a7896-9167-44f5-9f6c-ccbfbdf0d8d0'></a>\n\nLink: Exchange Transfusion\n\nVI. **Post-Discharge Follow-Up** is individualized to assess for rebound hyperbilirubinemia and prolonged unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (TB > 14 mg/dL). Follow-up is based on postnatal age, GA, presence of hemolysis, and etiology of hyperbilirubinemia.\n\n**Developmental Follow-Up:** Infants with TB > 25 mg/dL and those who receive an exchange transfusion, should be followed through infancy until school age for awkwardness, gait abnormality, failure of fine stereognosis, gaze abnormalities, poor coordination, and exaggerated extrapyramidal reflexes. They could be at subtle risk of post-icteric sequelae during infancy and childhood. Follow-up should include:\n\nA. Neurologic and neurodevelopmental evaluation: at discharge and within 3 mos\nB.

Epi\n\n<a id='482b0c42-4a4a-459d-88c3-1c605ce142cf'></a>\n\n# I. Background\n\nA. Infants are overall at lower risk for thrombosis than adults. However, severely ill neonates may be at higher risk for thromboembolic events due to a number of predisposing conditions:\n\n1. Indwelling central catheters and associated vascular damage\n2. Activation of coagulation in sepsis\n3. \"Low flow\" scenarios (e.g., shock, low cardiac output)\n4. Surgery/trauma\n5. Maternal diabetes mellitus\n6. Congenital heart disease\n7. Renal or hepatic function abnormalities\n\nB. Neonatal thrombosis is usually associated with line placements or attempts (umbilical, femoral/cardiac catheterization), but may also be seen in unusual sites or high-flow vessels.\n\n1. IVC, femoral veins, SVC\n2. CNS sinuses\n3. Aorta, femoral arteries, renal arteries\n4. Middle cerebral artery\n\nC. Thrombosis may be multifactorial; however, a genetic/inherited thrombophilic condition may be present that predisposes the infant to thrombosis in the setting of specific medical conditions. Unfortunately, it is not usually possible from the clinical presentation alone to ascertain which patient with a thrombus has an inherited condition. It may be important to identify patients with thrombophilias for long-term management, and for family counseling.\n\n<a id='5897a53a-ca06-428a-8e78-b6bc4c02c7b0'></a>\n\nII. **Purpose of Suggested Guidelines for Work-up**\n\nTo develop a strategy whereby meaningful diagnostic studies are consistently performed in infants with documented thrombotic phenomenon so that thrombophilias may be identified early, and proper treatment and counseling can take place\n\n<a id='bd89f814-0cf2-416a-97e1-f27b18a6608a'></a>\n\n### III. Suggested Guidelines\n\nA. Patient identification\n\n1. Thrombi are most often identified in the neonatal period by an ultrasound obtained after clinical suspicion of thrombus (e.g., extremity swelling). Occasionally, a thrombus may be detected as an incidental finding.\n2. There are no clear guidelines of the size, type or site of thrombus that should absolutely lead to a complete\n\n<a id='601d3f8e-bcb5-4ec3-96b3-d4f03b954b47'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

However, suggested scenarios that might prompt work-up include:\n\na. Unprovoked thromboemboli (i.e., no catheter or line attempts near the thrombus site) or is in any \"unusual\" site.\nb. Recurrent thromboemboli\nc. A strong family history of thromboemboli (i.e., myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accidents in family members < 50 years, deep vein thrombi, pulmonary embolism, recurrent miscarriages).\n\n<a id='217f20a6-4f06-4767-bcf1-61e80a833f44'></a>\n\n3. Recent literature indicates that a thrombophilia work-up is not indicated as part of the evaluation for a perinatal stroke.\n\n<a id='ab6d577a-bfed-4a8d-839b-c7917313551b'></a>\n\nB. Approach\n\n1.  Obtain a thorough family clotting/ischemia history.\n2.  Recommended \"special\" tests for a thrombophilia work-up include:\n    a. Factor V Leiden: 1 ml blood/purple-top tube\n    b. Prothrombin mutation analysis: 1 ml blood/purple-top tube\n    c. Serum homocysteine concentration. If abnormal follow with MTHFR gene mutation analysis\n3.  Consider a work-up on the mother:\n    a. Lupus anticoagulant 3 ml blood/blue-top tube\n    b. Antiphospholipid Ab 4 ml blood/red-top tube\n4.  Protein C, Protein S, and Antithrombin III (AT III) levels in the neonate should usually be **delayed 3-6 mos** since normal physiologic levels of these proteins are decreased in neonates, and may overlap abnormal values. In addition, these factors are consumed during active thrombosis, decreasing levels further. Parental testing may be considered before that time.\n    a. **Homozygous Protein C and S deficiencies** are clinically severe, usually presenting with purpura fulminans. If this diagnosis is considered likely, testing in the neonate, as well as the parents, should be performed.\n    b. **Homozygous AT III deficiency** is exceedingly rare since it is usually embryonic lethal.\n\n<a id='e04020d1-6d5f-463c-9156-e8556f6109f5'></a>\n\nC. Therapeutic Options\n\n1. A Pediatric Hematology consult is strongly recommended when anticoagulation or thrombolytic therapy is being contemplated.\n\n2. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) has been used increasingly as the treatment of choice for antithrombotic therapy. Potential advantages over heparin therapy include more predictable pharmacokinetics (usually resulting in a decreased need for invasive monitoring), subcutaneous administration, and probably reduced risks with longer-term therapy. Note that decreased levels of AT III (as can be seen in ill neonates, or infants with inherited or acquired AT III deficiencies) can impair the anticoagulant properties of heparin. If LMWH (enoxaparin) is indicated, the following are published guidelines for dosing and therapeutic monitoring.\n\n<a id='339b2835-acec-4591-853b-cb4b074acaa0'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Pulmonary regurgitation murmurs are heard best at the second left intercostal space and occur with postoperative TOF , pulmonary hypertension, postoperative pulmonary valvotomy or deformity of the pulmonary valve.\n\nb. Mid-diastolic murmurs result from abnormal ventricular filling. These are low pitched and may be associated with mitral stenosis or large left-to-right shunt lesions such as a VSD or PDA.\n\nc.

Chest x-ray (frontal and lateral views):\nEvaluate the heart size and shape, location of the aortic arch (right vs. left), and cardiac situs. Also view the lungs to evaluate if lungs are dark (poorly perfused) or opaque (increased pulmonary blood flow). Examples of \"textbook\" cardiac silhouettes include \"boot shaped\" heart (TOF) and a heart that looks like an \"egg on a string\" (d-transposition of the great arteries).\n\n### B. Electrocardiogram (ECG):\n1. Because it reflects the hemodynamic relationships that existed in utero, a normal newborn ECG is notable for right ventricular predominance. However, the ECG may be normal for age despite structural pathology.\n2. Evaluation should include duration of the P wave, QRS complex, QT interval (corrected for rate), calculation of the PR, RP, ST segments, and evaluation of the T-wave morphology.\n\n### C. Echocardiology:\nAn echocardiogram should be obtained if there is a concern for CHD. This will be a 2-dimensional study supplemented with color Doppler.\n\n### D. Cardiac Catheterization:\nMay be utilized for anatomic definition if not demonstrated adequately by echocardiography. Indications for cardiac catheterization include:\n1. Therapeutic: balloon atrial septostomy, balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty, balloon aortic valvuloplasty.\n2. Diagnostic: to provide further anatomic definition (e.g., coronary artery anatomy in pulmonary atresia or D-TGA, aortopulmonary collateral anatomy in TOF with pulmonary atresia)\n\n### E. CT Angiography\nMay be utilized for diagnostic purposes to provide further anatomic delineation, e.g. aortopulmonary collateral anatomy in TOF with pulmonary atresia, coronaries",

Neonates with congenital heart disease should be resuscitated with 21% FiO2 as with normal newborn patients requiring resuscitation. Infant with severe cyanosis in a mixing lesion and an oxygen saturation of less than 70% should be provided a 5% increase in the amount of oxygen every one minute until Sa02 rises to >75% and monitored closely to ensure that the Sa02 remains in the range of 75-85%. Once the oxygen saturation is ≥75%, oxygen should be discontinued. A STAT echocardiogram should be ordered to confirm the prenatal diagnosis. The cardiology service should be immediately notified upon NICU admission. At birth, the PVR generally is higher and takes time to decrease, thus patients with propensity for increased ratio of pulmonary blood flow: systemic blood flow (Qp: Qs), such as patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, atrioventricular canal defects and truncus arteriosus, are not likely to have increased Qp early on.\n\nB. **ER and NICU Admissions**\n\nInfants admitted from the ER in shock need immediate correction of metabolic acidosis with volume expanders first, and possibly bicarbonate. Correction of acidosis is necessary to improve cardiac output and tissue/organ perfusion. Vascular access including an arterial line (UAC or peripheral/femoral) and central venous access (PICC, UVC or CVL) is essential. Inotropic support may be required to improve ventricular function, mean arterial pressure, Qp:Qs, and urine output. Infants may also require tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation to manage their CHF, and decrease work of breathing and metabolic demand.",

Respiratory Management\n\nInfants with cardiac defects that place them at risk for increased pulmonary blood flow require close monitoring of systemic and pulmonary circulations. The intrauterine circulation is characterized by increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). As PVR decreases over the 1st wk of life, the PDA shunts left-to-right. This creates the potential for excessive blood flow to the lungs relative to the systemic circulation (increased Qp:Qs) leading to pulmonary edema. Pulmonary overcirculation occurs when Qp:Qs is sufficiently unbalanced such that systemic end organ perfusion is compromise, d leading to development of metabolic acidosis and decreased urine output. This can be seen not only in ductal dependent lesions but in large, VSDs, AV canals, truncus arteriosus and other lesions with potential for increased Qp:Qs.",

Monitoring:\n\nInfants with mixing lesions have an oxygen saturation goal of 75-85% and/or a PaO2 in the high 30's to mid 40's. It is important to look at both measures when making management decisions. When pulmonary vascular resistance begins to decrease, there may be an initial increase in SaO2 and PaO2. However, as increased pulmonary flow develops, the oxygen saturation and PaO2 may decrease secondary to pulmonary fluid overload and the infant may develop signs of low systemic perfusion (decreased urine output, prolonged capillary refill, and radiographic evidence of pulmonary edema). These clinical symptoms need to be corrected quickly using the previously described measures, before metabolic acidosis complicates the infant's condition. Serial lactate levels are useful in detecting decreased systemic oxygen delivery.",

Antibiotics prior to surgery are not routinely indicated in infants with cardiac anomalies. However, the infant may require antibiotics independent of cardiac disease based on the clinical scenario and laboratory findings. PGE1 may cause intermittent hyperthermia and thereby increase the suspicion of infection.\n\nE. Fluids, Electrolytes, and Nutrition Management\n\n1.  Pre-operative fluids are usually maintained at 60-80 ml/kg/day. Volume expanders may be given for hemodynamic resuscitation.\n2.  Monitoring of electrolytes is important to prevent dysrhythmias and maintain optimal cardiac function. It is particularly important to keep the ionized calcium level normal (>1.2). Maintenance calcium should be added to the IV fluid. CaCl infusion (10-20 mg/kg/dose) should be used to correct the ionized calcium as indicated)\n3.  In general, electrolytes, ABGs, and lactate levels are monitored every 6-12 hrs for the first 48 hrs. Once stable, discuss the frequency with the Cardiology team.\n4.  Start on TPN as soon as stable, advancing AA, IL, and dextrose to optimize caloric intake.\n5.  Furosemide or other diuretics may be indicated, particularly in lesions with left to right shunting leading to increased pulmonary blood flow (Qp). Any change in diuretic therapy should be discussed with Cardiology.\n6.  Consider starting feeds if surgery is not imminent and the infant is stable.\n7.  Avoid upper extremity PICC lines in patients on the single ventricle pathway. The SVC will be utilized as part of the single ventricle palliative repair and placement of a line in the SVC runs the risk of clot formation. If line access is needed and unable to obtain umbilical lines please discuss with CV3 team.",

The CVICU have a feeding pathways, simple and complex, for infants >2.5kg and these should be referenced when starting feeds in that population.\n\n   Some infants who have cardiac lesions in which blood flow to the bowel may have been compromised preoperatively are at risk for necrotizing enterocolitis. These lesions include the following: interrupted aortic arch repair, coarctation repair, aortic stenosis repair, and HLHS. In these infants, feeds should be advanced slowly and with caution.\n\n2. Other fluids should be managed similarly to the pre-op fluids mentioned above. It is important to maximize calories either in the TPN or by increasing calories and/or volume of feedings. If the infant experiences poor weight gain, and the clinical condition tolerates, fluids can be advanced to 150-160 ml/kg/day and caloric density of feeds increased to 27-30 cal/oz. Advance 2-4 cal/oz per day as tolerated to achieve adequate weight gain.\n\n3. Electrolytes should be monitored daily until stable, then weekly or twice a week if on diuretics. Maintain ionized calcium between 1.3-1.4 during the first 3-4 days; once stable 1.1-1.2 is adequate. Do not infuse calcium drips through lines with TPN or calcium through a PIV!\n\n4. Diuretics may need to be adjusted or changed as dictated by clinical findings such as pulmonary edema or intravascular depletion with Cardiology consultation.",

Use previously described transfusion parameters if infant is unstable, otherwise may allow infant to fall into more physiologic parameters. Start vitamins and iron once infant is stable on full feeds.\n2. Some infants with shunts or a patch will be on aspirin. The usual dose is 5 mg/kg/day PO/NG and should be continued at discharge.",

For discharge teaching, go to \"Micromedex\" in the computer and click on the section \"Caring for Baby/Child after Heart Surgery.\"\n3.  Parent teaching should be started early for these complex patients.\n4.  Appointments with the PCP and Cardiologist should be scheduled prior to discharge. Please send a packet of information to each that includes the admission H&P, Discharge Summary, and the Operative Note. Additionally, a copy of the last ECHO on disk should be included in the Cardiologist's packet. Follow up will not be in LPCH system.\n5.  Post-Op TOF/PA/MAPCAS\n    a. Need lung perfusion scan prior to discharge. (Place Nuclear Med Order and call 650-723-6855 to schedule)\n    b. Need discharge ECHO.\n    c. If future CV surgery required, discuss with CV3 team, the potential need to have outpatient cardiac catheterization, and possibly surgery date scheduled prior to discharge",

The normal pacemaker of the heart is the sinus node, with the AV node and the ventricle as two other potential pacemaker sites. These pacemaker sites have lower rates than the sinus node, however they will take over if the sinus node slows or fails. Complexes generated from the ventricle usually will be wider than those from the atria since the cells initially depolarize cell to cell rather than fully through the His-purkinje system.",

Reentrant tachycardias are more commonly found in neonates than automatic tachycardias. Atrial tachycardias are often narrow complex as the impulse depolarizes utilizing the His-purkinje system. If part of the His-Purkinje System is refractory when the signal arrives, the tachycardia may be wide complex (aberrancy)\n\na. Reentrant supraventricular tachycardia - most commonly caused by an accessory pathway, e.g. Wolff Parkinson White. Regular rate, break the circuit with vagal maneuvers, adenosine or DC cardioversion. If atrial wires are in place, can overdrive atrial pace to break the circuit. Medications for control include propranolol and digoxin (though digoxin avoided in patients with WPW)\n\n<::ECG strip illustrating reentrant supraventricular tachycardia\n: chart::>\n\nb. Ectopic atrial tachycardia - Automatic focus within the atria. Irregular, does not usually break with adenosine or DC cardioversion as there is no circuit to interrupt. Consider administering sedation to decrease catecholamines during initial management. Medical management includes amiodarone, propranolol and digoxin. Multifocal atrial tachycardia has multiple automatic foci with different pwave morphologies.\n\n<::ECG strip illustrating ectopic atrial tachycardia\n: chart::>\n\nc. AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) - less commonly found in neonates, reentrant tachycardia within the AV node. Pwaves not usually seen.\n\nd. Atrial flutter - Reentrant tachycardia around the tricuspid valve, depending on how often the signal travels through the AV node and down the His-Purkinje System will have variable conduction (2:1, 3:1, 4:1, etc). Using adenosine will block the AV node and demonstrate more clearly the underlying atrial flutter. Can utilize DC cardioversion or overdrive pacing to break the circuit.\n\n<::ECG strip illustrating atrial flutter\n: chart::>\n\ne. Atrial fibrillation - Mostly due to small circuits in left atrium around pulmonary veins. Irregularly irregular, very rare in neonates. Cardioversion often needed. Medications may be utilized for rate control",

Anatomic closure normally occurs within 10 days. In the premature infant, closure often will not occur until term.\n\nB. Left-to-right shunting through the ductus may contribute to increasing pulmonary edema, persistent need for ventilator support, and the development of BPD. Decreased systemic perfusion to end organs like brain, kidney, and intestines may also occur. These potential complications have traditionally been the motivation to achieve ductal closure.\n\nC. It remains unclear if treatment of a PDA results in improved long-term outcomes. Recent analyses have shown that treatment of a PDA does NOT reduce the common complications of prematurity including death, BPD, IVH, or NEC1. Risks of medical or surgical closure also exist. Therefore, determination of the hemodynamic significance of the PDA in a particular patient is essential in decision making until further evidence from clinical studies can be acquired to guide optimal treatment.",

Background\n\nDespite changes in the nature and epidemiology of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), patients with BPD are more likely to develop pulmonary hypertension (PH) than those without, and the morbidity and mortality associated with PH in this population remains high. Even in the \"post-surfactant era,\" in severe cases of late PH mortality rates near 70% are reported. PH also contributes to the cardiopulmonary abnormalities seen in BPD patients, including decreased right ventricular (RV) function, reduced cardiac output, limited oxygen delivery, and increased pulmonary edema. Moreover, PH affects the development of the lung circulation in BPD patients, leading to persistent abnormal lung growth via a reduction in number (impaired angiogenesis) and an altered pattern of distribution of small pulmonary arteries within the lung interstitium. The arterial tree has increased vascular tone and has undergone hypertensive remodeling. In this population, reduced alveolarization along with the simplification of the distal lung airspaces results in a decreased overall alveolar-capillary surface area. PH has a significant effect on the clinical course of BPD due to these effects on lung development. Patients develop elevated pulmonary vascular resistance and abnormal vasoreactivity, as demonstrated by their marked vasoconstrictor response to acute hypoxia, which persists late into the course of the disease. They also often have a prolonged need for oxygen and ventilator therapy. During respiratory infections or exercise, they can have profound hypoxemia; likewise, relatively minor amounts of right to left shunting can lead to significant hemodynamic compromise.",

Diagnosis of PH can be difficult in BPD patients given the subtle symptoms and the overlap with signs consistent with primary respiratory abnormalities. Early detection, though, may provide important prognostic information as well as allow for early aggressive therapy to improve late outcomes. Unfortunately, little data exists regarding the incidence and natural history of PH in BPD patients and PH in the setting of BPD is ill-defined. Echocardiography remains the best non-invasive screening tool for PH, but in the absence of tricuspid regurgitation, is not a reliable estimate of pulmonary artery pressure. In such cases, severity of PH may be estimated using qualitative findings, such as flattening of the interventricular septum, presence of shunts, evidence of pulmonary venous obstruction, and LV and RV size and function.",

Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a potent vasoconstrictor and smooth muscle mitogen that has been linked to the pathogenesis of PH in term infants with PPHN and CDH, as well as premature infants with RDS.\n2. Bosentan acts as an antagonist to the receptor of ET-1, thereby inhibiting vasoconstriction. It has been shown to be safe and effective in children as young as 9 months, but its use in BPD is limited to case studies.\n3. Starting dose: 1 mg/kg/dose BID. Increase to 2 mg/kg/dose BID after 2-4 weeks if no changes in liver function tests. Monitor liver function tests monthly.",

The Paul Gann Blood Safety Act (Health and Safety Code Section 1645) requires that physicians or nurse practitioners provide patients with a state-produced handout, \"A Patient's Guide to Blood Transfusions,” whenever there is the possibility that a blood transfusion will be necessary. This handout describes the risks and benefits of autologous, designated (also known as directed), and non-designated allogeneic blood donations. This brochure should be given in addition to having the parent or guardian sign informed consent.",

Parents whose children are in the NICU receive a general information packet upon admission from either the bedside nurse or the unit clerk. Within this packet is a letter explaining the possible need for blood product transfusion, the types of transfusion, as well as options for directed donation.\n2.  The Gann Act should be discussed with parents of infants with a reasonable likelihood of requiring a transfusion. If an infant has a low likelihood for needing blood products (e.g., rule-out sepsis patients), the Gann Act does not need to be discussed.\n3.  In the case of an emergency transfusion, the Gann Act does not apply, but if further transfusions are anticipated, the above procedure should be followed",

All infants admitted to the NICU should have an initial ABO/Rh sent with the first blood draw performed for other clinical indications (note: if labs are not indicated, there is no need to send an ABO/Rh). For patients who may need blood product components, ABO/Rh type must be verified by a second sample drawn at a separate time.

Additionally, premature infants <35 weeks gestation receive CMV negative products. The attributes of the blood products are automatically chosen based on patient diagnosis (see below).\n\n4. The patient's diagnosis should be indicated in the order. The required \"Comorbidity\" entry is typically a newborn <4 months, but additional comorbidities may be present, depending on the individual clinical situation (e.g., ECMO <4 months). The provider must chose multiple co-morbidities if applicable. The volume of blood product component must be entered separately in both the nursing \"order to transfuse\" and blood product order.\n\n5. When blood products are needed within one hour of the order, place the order STAT.\n\n6. In case of an extreme emergency, providers should order uncrossmatched blood via the Emergency Release Blood Product order set in EPIC and a phone call notifying the Transfusion Service Charge Tech (723-6445) should be made. A runner must be sent to the Transfusion Service with the correct patient label to pick up the emergency blood products.\n\n7.

Patients typically receive 10-15 mL/kg PBRCs depending on the starting and target hematocrits. Patients usually receive type-specific blood, and always ABO compatible even in the case of uncrossmatched emergencies. The blood may be infused over 1-4 hrs as determined by the hemodynamic status of the patient. PRBCs expire 4 hours after they are issued from the Transfusion Service. Consider administration of a diuretic following transfusion in fluid-sensitive patients.\n2. Potassium leaks from PRBCs during storage, especially after irradiation. The amount of free potassium in a small aliquot (10-15 mL/kg) PRBC transfusion is not clinically significant. In the case of massive transfusion or in patients with reduced ability to handle potassium (e.g., renal failure, acidosis), transient hyperkalemia may occur and washing of cells is appropriate if fresh RBC units less than 10 days old are not available. Please call the Transfusion Service or page the Transfusion Service physician at 12027 to assist with ordering of washed PRBCs if indicated.\n3. The hematocrit of PRBC transfusions is approximately 55-60%. Occasionally, \"dry\" PRBCs are indicated to limit the volume of incompatible plasma infused. These \"dry packed units\" have a hematocrit of approximately 85% and require dilution with normal saline prior to use. Instructions for dilution are sent attached to the \"dry packed\" PRBCs from the Transfusion Service.\n4. Indications for PRBC transfusion are patient-specific. In general, the need for transfusion increases with respiratory or cardiac instability. Please discuss transfusion indications with the Attending.",

Each apheresis unit is equivalent to 6 random donor pooled platelets (which are not available at Stanford). A whole apheresis unit is approximately 250 mL. Platelets are ordered by volume, not units, in the neonatal population (10-15 mL/kg). For a volume less than 90 ml, a syringe aliquot (10-90 ml) will be prepared in the transfusion service. Platelets expire 4 hours after issue and are infused over 30-60 minutes.\n\n2. In some cases, only ABO-incompatible platelets will be available. If more than 15 mL of platelets are ordered, they will be \"packed\" by the Transfusion Service to reduce the amount of ABO-incompatible plasma given to the patient. Transfusion Service will place a sticker on the bag indicating that the volume of platelets transfused should not exceed 5 mL/kg. It is an acceptable clinical decision, however, to transfuse more than 5mL/kg of ABO-incompatible platelets in a patient who needs more platelets.\n\n3. The threshold for platelet transfusion varies according to the patient's clinical situation. Examples of appropriate indications include any infant with active bleeding, a premature infant at risk for intracranial hemorrhage or any infant at risk for post-operative bleeding. Please discuss patient-specific transfusion indications with the Attending.",

Directed donation comes from a qualified donor who is a parent or other person chosen by the family. Studies indicate that directed donors have similar or higher rates of infectious disease markers compared to volunteer donors. Therefore, directed blood is NOT safer than volunteer blood. A possible reason for this discrepancy is that directed donors may feel under pressure to donate and may not admit to risk factors. For this reason, parents should not be pressured to provide directed donors on behalf of their child. There may also be circumstances where directed blood is not appropriate due to HLA-sensitization issues (e.g., anticipated organ transplant from a family member).\n\n2.  Directed donations require a written order from a physician or nurse practitioner. A physician/NNP may place an order by faxing a written order to the Special Donations Department at the Stanford Blood Center (fax 650-723-8155). The intended donor must contact Special Donations (phone 650-723-6667) to make an appointment to donate. Please see the website bloodcenter.stanford.edu to obtain the order form and for more information.\n\n3.  Order \"CMV negative\" (i.e., CMV antibody negative) blood for the following infants: <35 weeks gestation, infants with suspected severe immunodeficiency (e.g. DiGeorge, SCID), infants born to mothers with HIV infection and infants with complex congenital heart disease.\n\n**NOTE**: Only about 50% of donors will be CMV antibody negative. If \"CMV negative\" is required for an infant receiving a directed donation, and the donor is found to be CMV antibody positive, the unit will NOT be used for the infant.\n\nNormal full-term infants do not require CMV antibody negative blood components. All directed donations will be leukoreduced, which reduces the risk of CMV transmission.",

The shelf life of directed units may be shorter than units from community donors because all directed units are irradiated. The shelf life is limited to 28 days or less if the directed units need to be manipulated because of plasma incompatibility.\n\nb. A mother may be permitted to donate red blood cells on behalf of her child if her hemoglobin is high enough and her obstetrician provides written authorization.\n\nc. All directed donors including the mother must be screened carefully with questions about risk factors as well as blood testing for infectious diseases. About 15% of individuals presenting to donate do not meet donor eligibility criteria.\n\nd. Individuals with a history of pregnancy or transfusion are not permitted to donate plasma products (FFP, FP24 and platelets). This includes mothers of newborn infants. This policy was put in place by the FDA to reduce the incidence of Transfusion Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI), now the most common cause of transfusion-related fatality. TRALI is often associated with donor antibodies to WBC antigens (HLA and granulocyte antigens); these antibodies are most commonly induced by pregnancy.",

Factors that place these infants at risk include: disordered bilirubin-albumin binding, starvation, and/or decreased enteral intake leading to decreased gastrointestinal (GI) activity resulting in increased enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin. Contributing physiologic conditions include: a damaged blood-brain barrier, asphyxia, acidosis, and hypoalbuminemia. Thus, bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction or BIND may occur at lower total serum/plasma bilirubin (TB) levels than those for term and healthy infants. DO NOT SUBTRACT THE DIRECT BILIRUBIN VALUE FROM THE TB LEVEL TO CALCULATE THE INDIRECT BILIRUBIN VALUE FOR CLINICAL DECISIONS UNLESS DIRECT BILIRUBIN IS >50% OF TB.",

Clinical Manifestations\n\nJaundice can be detected by using digital pressure to blanch the skin at the forehead, sternum, iliac crest, patella, or malleolus to reveal the underlying skin and subcutaneous tissue color. Jaundice should be assessed whenever the infant's vital signs are being measured, but no less than every 8 to 12 hrs. The assessment of visible jaundice must be done in a well-lit room or, preferably, in daylight with ambient sunlight. The degree of jaundice can vary in color from lemon yellow to bright orange and sienna. Accuracy of assessment may be limited by an infant's skin pigmentation, plethora, and previous exposure to sun or phototherapy as well as decreased ambient light during assessment. It must be remembered that the absence of jaundice is not an indication of the absence of hyperbilirubinemia. In addition, estimating the degree of hyperbilirubinemia can lead to errors. The absence or severity of jaundice is not predictive of subsequent severe hyperbilirubinemia",

In term and late preterm infants, the TB level can be plotted on the Bhutani nomogram to identify the infant's percentile risk zone in combination with assessment of clinical risk factors. The Bhutani nomogram provides a more appropriate understanding of the magnitude of the hyperbilirubinemia and a projected TB ROR as a function of postnatal age (in hrs) as defined for healthy infants. A transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) measurement is a noninvasive alternative to a TB measurement. TcB devices are useful screening tools and provide a valid estimate of TB levels (up to 12.5 mg/dL), although data are limited",

Background Information\n\n**THIS MODE OF TREATMENT DOES NOT EMIT UV LIGHT**\n\nThe optimal light source is blue light within a narrow range wavelength (460-490 nm; such as that provided by blue light-emitting diodes [LEDs]) that is distributed evenly to one plane of the body (and can be increased to both ventral and dorsal planes or even, circumferential) at an irradiance of >30 to <35 µW/cm²/nm in infants > 28 wks GA. Photodegradation of bilirubin by blue light exposure is almost immediate and may not reflect measured TB levels. Multiple light sources are available to cover a wider surface area with a uniform footprint of irradiance. Avoid shadows with multiple lights and other interferences for optimal light exposure. Avoid exposure to UV lights (such as fluorescent tubes).",

Management of Hyperbilirubinemia in Sick and Preterm Infants\n\nThe primary strategy for clinical management of sick and preterm infants is prevention. Jaundice should be monitored along with other vital signs. TB measurements should be done every 8 to 12 hrs; can be decreased to every 12 to 24 hrs if infant is under phototherapy, when TB levels are decreasing, or when the infant is beyond 1 wk of age. Sick and preterm infants may be at increased risk during an acute rise of bilirubin with concurrent infection or illness, when NPO, or as a result of a transfusion or acute hemolysis",

However, severely ill neonates may be at higher risk for thromboembolic events due to a number of predisposing conditions:\n\n1. Indwelling central catheters and associated vascular damage\n2. Activation of coagulation in sepsis\n3. \"Low flow\" scenarios (e.g., shock, low cardiac output)\n4. Surgery/trauma\n5. Maternal diabetes mellitus\n6. Congenital heart disease\n7. Renal or hepatic function abnormalities\n\nB. Neonatal thrombosis is usually associated with line placements or attempts (umbilical, femoral/cardiac catheterization), but may also be seen in unusual sites or high-flow vessels.\n\n1. IVC, femoral veins, SVC\n2. CNS sinuses\n3. Aorta, femoral arteries, renal arteries\n4. Middle cerebral artery\n\nC. Thrombosis may be multifactorial; however, a genetic/inherited thrombophilic condition may be present that predisposes the infant to thrombosis in the setting of specific medical conditions. Unfortunately, it is not usually possible from the clinical presentation alone to ascertain which patient with a thrombus has an inherited condition. It may be important to identify patients with thrombophilias for long-term management, and for family counseling.",

Recommended \"special\" tests for a thrombophilia work-up include:\n    a. Factor V Leiden: 1 ml blood/purple-top tube\n    b. Prothrombin mutation analysis: 1 ml blood/purple-top tube\n    c. Serum homocysteine concentration. If abnormal follow with MTHFR gene mutation analysis\n3.  Consider a work-up on the mother:\n    a. Lupus anticoagulant 3 ml blood/blue-top tube\n    b. Antiphospholipid Ab 4 ml blood/red-top tube\n4.  Protein C, Protein S, and Antithrombin III (AT III) levels in the neonate should usually be **delayed 3-6 mos** since normal physiologic levels of these proteins are decreased in neonates, and may overlap abnormal values. In addition, these factors are consumed during active thrombosis, decreasing levels further. Parental testing may be considered before that time.\n    a. **Homozygous Protein C and S deficiencies** are clinically severe, usually presenting with purpura fulminans. If this diagnosis is considered likely, testing in the neonate, as well as the parents, should be performed.\n    b. **Homozygous AT III deficiency** is exceedingly rare since it is usually embryonic lethal.",

A Pediatric Hematology consult is strongly recommended when anticoagulation or thrombolytic therapy is being contemplated.\n\n2. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) has been used increasingly as the treatment of choice for antithrombotic therapy. Potential advantages over heparin therapy include more predictable pharmacokinetics (usually resulting in a decreased need for invasive monitoring), subcutaneous administration, and probably reduced risks with longer-term therapy. Note that decreased levels of AT III (as can be seen in ill neonates, or infants with inherited or acquired AT III deficiencies) can impair the anticoagulant properties of heparin. If LMWH (enoxaparin) is indicated, the following are published guidelines for dosing and therapeutic monitoring.",

Systolic ejection murmurs present in the delivery room are usually pathologic and may be related to pulmonary or aortic stenosis. These are best heard at the second left or right intercostal spaces.\n\n<a id='9306465e-0af2-4852-b70d-95287ec95dc0'></a>\n\n3. Systolic regurgitant murmurs begin with S1, with no interval between S1 and the beginning of the murmur. These murmurs generally continue throughout systole (pansystolic or holosystolic), and are caused by flow of blood from a chamber at a higher pressure to one at a lower pressure. These are associated with VSD, mitral regurgitation, and tricuspid regurgitation.\n\n<a id='680aab66-e5cd-496b-a51c-05f1474349c2'></a>\n\n4. Diastolic murmurs are classified by the timing of the murmur:\n\na. Early diastolic murmurs occur right after S2 and are related to incompetence of the aortic or pulmonary valve. Aortic murmurs are high- pitched and best heard at the third left intercostal space. They occur with bicuspid aortic valve and subaortic infundibular VSD. Pulmonary regurgitation murmurs are heard best at the second left intercostal space and occur with postoperative TOF , pulmonary hypertension, postoperative pulmonary valvotomy or deformity of the pulmonary valve.\n\nb. Mid-diastolic murmurs result from abnormal ventricular filling. These are low pitched and may be associated with mitral stenosis or large left-to-right shunt lesions such as a VSD or PDA.\n\nc. Late diastolic murmurs result from flow through AV valves during ventricular diastole and are low frequency murmurs.\n\n<a id='bd98a20b-447b-4aef-a20e-0d1de12bb412'></a>\n\n5. Murmurs due to left-to-right shunt lesions may not be heard until the 2nd to 4th week of life, when the pulmonary vascular resistance decreases and flow into the lungs increases.\n6. Ejection clicks can be normal in the first 24 hrs of life, but after that are considered pathologic. May be associated with dilation of a great artery, malformation of a semilunar valve (aortic or pulmonary) or truncal valve in truncus arteriosus.\n\n<a id='456d6352-2235-4100-bc97-9096a29f78a1'></a>\n\n**H. Blood Pressure:**\n\nFour extremity blood pressures may be helpful in identifying an aortic arch lesion. A systolic pressure more than 10 mmHg higher in the upper body as compared to the lower body should raise concern for a coarctation of the aorta, aortic arch hypoplasia or interrupted aortic arch.\n\n<a id='898cf1b2-9a6d-4a04-aa3c-14ee90da5f3e'></a>\n\nI. Pulse ox screen:\n\nUtilized to detect critical CHD that requires intervention in the first year of life. Up to 25-30% of CHD diagnosed in the first month of life may be critical. Critical CHD may be prostaglandin dependent for pulmonary blood flow (e.g. Tetralogy of Fallot or pulmonary atresia/intact ventricular septum) or for systemic blood flow (e.g. hypoplastic left heart syndrome). Critical CHD also includes mixing lesions that may lead to damage to the pulmonary vascular bed and congestive heart failure in the first year of life (e.g. truncus arteriosus, total anomalous pulmonary venous return). The State of California mandates pulse ox screening for all neonates prior to discharge from the WBN or intensive care nursery (NICU or ICN) if an echocardiogram has not been performed.\n\n<a id='ab021be5-8f19-46cb-8441-7cc5240c4d2d'></a>\n\n1. There are 7 primary targets of pulse ox screening: hypoplastic left heart syndrome, pulmonary atresia with intact septum, tetralogy of fallot, total anomalous pulmonary venous return, transposition of the great arteries, tricuspid atresia, and truncus arteriosus. Five secondary targets include: coarctation of the aorta, double outlet right ventricle, Ebstein's anomaly, interrupted aortic arch and single ventricle.\n2. Screening recommended between 24-48 hours\n   a. Right hand (pre-ductal) and one foot (post-ductal)\n\n<a id='d6ee9dc2-36d4-4e5c-9e9f-b7c2270e0d17'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Critically failed screen if <90% in either probe, notify MD immediately\n\nii. Failed screen if 90-94% on both extremities OR > 3% difference between both extremities – repeat screen in 4 hours and if still fail, notify MD immediately\n\nd. The timing of pulse ox screening in ill infants is not well established.\n\n3. Physical exam important – pulse ox not perfect, particularly in left sided lesions such as coarctation and interrupted aortic arch – make sure to feel for pulses!\n\n<a id='27609d4d-055e-4321-8b5d-7f0d05510a39'></a>\n\n## II. Diagnostic Studies\n\n### A. Chest x-ray (frontal and lateral views):\nEvaluate the heart size and shape, location of the aortic arch (right vs. left), and cardiac situs. Also view the lungs to evaluate if lungs are dark (poorly perfused) or opaque (increased pulmonary blood flow). Examples of \"textbook\" cardiac silhouettes include \"boot shaped\" heart (TOF) and a heart that looks like an \"egg on a string\" (d-transposition of the great arteries).\n\n### B. Electrocardiogram (ECG):\n1. Because it reflects the hemodynamic relationships that existed in utero, a normal newborn ECG is notable for right ventricular predominance. However, the ECG may be normal for age despite structural pathology.\n2. Evaluation should include duration of the P wave, QRS complex, QT interval (corrected for rate), calculation of the PR, RP, ST segments, and evaluation of the T-wave morphology.\n\n### C. Echocardiology:\nAn echocardiogram should be obtained if there is a concern for CHD. This will be a 2-dimensional study supplemented with color Doppler.\n\n### D. Cardiac Catheterization:\nMay be utilized for anatomic definition if not demonstrated adequately by echocardiography. Indications for cardiac catheterization include:\n1. Therapeutic: balloon atrial septostomy, balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty, balloon aortic valvuloplasty.\n2. Diagnostic: to provide further anatomic definition (e.g., coronary artery anatomy in pulmonary atresia or D-TGA, aortopulmonary collateral anatomy in TOF with pulmonary atresia)\n\n### E. CT Angiography\nMay be utilized for diagnostic purposes to provide further anatomic delineation, e.g. aortopulmonary collateral anatomy in TOF with pulmonary atresia, coronaries\n\n<a id='e2e2af74-827a-4655-97fd-683937ff34ab'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Neonates with congenital heart disease should be resuscitated with 21% FiO2 as with normal newborn patients requiring resuscitation. Infant with severe cyanosis in a mixing lesion and an oxygen saturation of less than 70% should be provided a 5% increase in the amount of oxygen every one minute until Sa02 rises to >75% and monitored closely to ensure that the Sa02 remains in the range of 75-85%. Once the oxygen saturation is ≥75%, oxygen should be discontinued. A STAT echocardiogram should be ordered to confirm the prenatal diagnosis. The cardiology service should be immediately notified upon NICU admission. At birth, the PVR generally is higher and takes time to decrease, thus patients with propensity for increased ratio of pulmonary blood flow: systemic blood flow (Qp: Qs), such as patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, atrioventricular canal defects and truncus arteriosus, are not likely to have increased Qp early on.\n\nB. **ER and NICU Admissions**\n\nInfants admitted from the ER in shock need immediate correction of metabolic acidosis with volume expanders first, and possibly bicarbonate. Correction of acidosis is necessary to improve cardiac output and tissue/organ perfusion. Vascular access including an arterial line (UAC or peripheral/femoral) and central venous access (PICC, UVC or CVL) is essential. Inotropic support may be required to improve ventricular function, mean arterial pressure, Qp:Qs, and urine output. Infants may also require tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation to manage their CHF, and decrease work of breathing and metabolic demand.\n\n<a id='270fb318-dac8-4e7e-a6fe-b1240f6c7a29'></a>\n\nII. **Pre-op Management**\n\nOnce the initial resuscitation is completed, there are several key points to keep in mind:\n\nA. **Cardiovascular Management**\n\nConsult Cardiology (CV3 team - pager# 2HART) for all infants with CHD and notify them of any changes in status.\n\n1.  **Management**\n    a.  **PGE1 administration** should begin immediately following delivery if there is suspicion of ductal-dependent CHD. Once an echocardiogram is completed and cardiac structure is confirmed normal, or the cardiac lesion confirmed to be not ductal-dependent, then the PGE1 can be discontinued per Cardiology's recommendation.\n        i.  **Ductal-dependent pulmonary flow lesions include**: severe Tetralogy of Fallot, (blue \"Tet\", TET/PA), Ebstein's anomaly, critical pulmonic stenosis, tricuspid valve atresia, and pulmonic valve atresia with intact ventricular septum.\n        ii. **Ductal-dependent systemic flow lesions include**: hypoplastic left heart syndrome, mitral atresia, coarctation, and interrupted aortic arch.\n    b.  **Consider SVR manipulation** by using vasoactive support such as milrinone to decrease afterload in order to balance Qp:Qs.\n\n<a id='372652d9-8637-4e32-9ab4-1171345ec3d2'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Correction of significant metabolic acidosis with either volume expanders or bicarbonate. May need adjustments in SVR as discussed above if metabolic acidosis is due to unbalanced Qp:Qs.\nd. Palliative, staged or complete surgical repair depending on the lesion.\n\n<a id='296a4c42-52ad-4a30-b7cf-793f3049ae6c'></a>\n\n## 2. Monitoring\n\na. **Continuous evaluation of blood pressure.** Normal mean arterial BP is approximately equivalent to the infant's gestational age. If an infant becomes hypotensive, use of inotropes or volume expansion should be carefully evaluated taking into consideration the specific cardiac lesion and clinical condition.\n\nb. **Continuous monitoring of heart rate** is necessary to identify any dysrhythmias. Tachycardic infants should be closely evaluated for fluid status, fever, and other potentially contributing factors. If heart block or other dysrhythmias occur, a 12-lead EKG should be obtained attempting to capture the dysrhythmia. Telemetry is available and should be reviewed regularly. Confirmation of central line placement and evaluation of serum electrolytes should be considered. Cardiology should be notified of any dysrhythmia.\n\n<a id='d43a2644-525e-4f15-9a4b-13820a8dd074'></a>\n\nB. Respiratory Management\n\nInfants with cardiac defects that place them at risk for increased pulmonary blood flow require close monitoring of systemic and pulmonary circulations. The intrauterine circulation is characterized by increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). As PVR decreases over the 1st wk of life, the PDA shunts left-to-right. This creates the potential for excessive blood flow to the lungs relative to the systemic circulation (increased Qp:Qs) leading to pulmonary edema. Pulmonary overcirculation occurs when Qp:Qs is sufficiently unbalanced such that systemic end organ perfusion is compromise, d leading to development of metabolic acidosis and decreased urine output. This can be seen not only in ductal dependent lesions but in large, VSDs, AV canals, truncus arteriosus and other lesions with potential for increased Qp:Qs.\n\n<a id='b2e8ee2c-57fb-4fe3-9b44-fe2c431a0211'></a>\n\n1.  **Management Options:**\n\n    a. If a patient with single ventricle physiology decompensates and requires intubation, this is likely an indication for urgent surgical palliation. The ability to manipulate to PVR through mechanical ventilation is less effective than manipulating SVR to affect Qp:Qs in patients with cardiac defects. Discuss with the CV3 team and CV surgeon.\n\n    b. Decrease respiratory drive with **sedation in infants who are intubated**. Paralysis may be used in conjunction with sedation in order to achieve this effect.\n\n<a id='3ddeab4c-cd53-4090-a0ae-29ed36e41cb4'></a>\n\n## 2. Monitoring:\n\nInfants with mixing lesions have an oxygen saturation goal of 75-85% and/or a PaO2 in the high 30's to mid 40's. It is important to look at both measures when making management decisions. When pulmonary vascular resistance begins to decrease, there may be an initial increase in SaO2 and PaO2. However, as increased pulmonary flow develops, the oxygen saturation and PaO2 may decrease secondary to pulmonary fluid overload and the infant may develop signs of low systemic perfusion (decreased urine output, prolonged capillary refill, and radiographic evidence of pulmonary edema). These clinical symptoms need to be corrected quickly using the previously described measures, before metabolic acidosis complicates the infant's condition. Serial lactate levels are useful in detecting decreased systemic oxygen delivery.\n\n<a id='6158218d-78cd-46ab-9466-00f51c7937b2'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Transfuse to maintain hematocrit ≥40%. In patients with single ventricle physiology, a hematocrit ≥40-45% is usually preferred. For initial transfusion, 10 ml/kg of PRBC's is given. If the patient is severely anemic, an additional 5-10 ml/kg of PRBC's may be necessary to achieve the goal hematocrit. Fluid status should be carefully evaluated prior to and following transfusion.\n2. If the coagulation panel is abnormal, correction is usually indicated. Coagulopathies must be corrected if there is clinical evidence of bleeding or if the infant is going to the OR or cath lab.\n\n<a id='111db59e-a360-4f14-850f-e53deadc4f46'></a>\n\nD. Infectious Disease Management\n\n1.  CBC and CRP/procalcitonin as clinically indicated if infection is suspected.\n2.  Antibiotics prior to surgery are not routinely indicated in infants with cardiac anomalies. However, the infant may require antibiotics independent of cardiac disease based on the clinical scenario and laboratory findings. PGE1 may cause intermittent hyperthermia and thereby increase the suspicion of infection.\n\nE. Fluids, Electrolytes, and Nutrition Management\n\n1.  Pre-operative fluids are usually maintained at 60-80 ml/kg/day. Volume expanders may be given for hemodynamic resuscitation.\n2.  Monitoring of electrolytes is important to prevent dysrhythmias and maintain optimal cardiac function. It is particularly important to keep the ionized calcium level normal (>1.2). Maintenance calcium should be added to the IV fluid. CaCl infusion (10-20 mg/kg/dose) should be used to correct the ionized calcium as indicated)\n3.  In general, electrolytes, ABGs, and lactate levels are monitored every 6-12 hrs for the first 48 hrs. Once stable, discuss the frequency with the Cardiology team.\n4.  Start on TPN as soon as stable, advancing AA, IL, and dextrose to optimize caloric intake.\n5.  Furosemide or other diuretics may be indicated, particularly in lesions with left to right shunting leading to increased pulmonary blood flow (Qp). Any change in diuretic therapy should be discussed with Cardiology.\n6.  Consider starting feeds if surgery is not imminent and the infant is stable.\n7.  Avoid upper extremity PICC lines in patients on the single ventricle pathway. The SVC will be utilized as part of the single ventricle palliative repair and placement of a line in the SVC runs the risk of clot formation. If line access is needed and unable to obtain umbilical lines please discuss with CV3 team.\n\n<a id='ffe97632-ec46-47e5-bd3f-56c994937797'></a>\n\nF. Renal Management\n\n1. Renal ultrasound is done pre-operatively to evaluate the kidneys as part of a genetic/dysmorphology work-up in all infants with cardiac anomalies.\n2. Urine output should be closely monitored to evaluate the need for fluid and/or evaluation of systemic perfusion. If the creatinine is elevated and there is concern for renal failure related to a hypoxic ischemic insult to the kidneys, Nephrology should be consulted.\n\n<a id='c72daae2-04d7-40ae-afb5-91d33dfb5e15'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

A head ultrasound should be done prior to surgery to evaluate for anomalies of the brain and to determine if cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) can be performed with an acceptable risk of intracranial bleeding. Infants with significant intracranial hemorrhage or recent cerebral infarct may not be candidates for CPB.\n2. NIRS monitoring is performed in all pre-op patients with cyanotic CHD. aEEG is used for patients who have suspected seizure activity.\n\nH. **Genetic Management**\n\n1. Infants with CHD should be considered for genetic testing. Please see Genetics section for details of which type of study to order.\n\nI. **Transfer for Surgery**\n\n1. A transfer summary must accompany the patient to the OR/CVICU.\n2. Verbal sign out should be coordinated with the CV3 and CVICU teams.\n\n<a id='aafb062f-9bf7-46d3-a772-f27570f2f15c'></a>\n\nII. **Post-op Management**\n\nFor the initial post-operative period, all post-surgical cardiac infants are managed in the CVICU. Once the infant is deemed stable by the CVICU and CV3 Team, the infant may transfer back to the NICU or the 3rd floor for care prior to discharge.\n\n<a id='21327155-88f1-41bc-8284-f7055f1024af'></a>\n\nA. Cardiovascular Management [should be done under guidance of Cardiology]\n\n1. Interventions for slow heart rate\n   a. **Isuprel** (rarely used): Dose: 0.05-0.5 mcg/kg/min IV\n   b. **Atropine**: Dose: 0.01-0.03 mg/kg/dose with minimum dose of 0.1 mg IV\n   c. **Epinephrine**: Dose: 0.01-0.03 mg/kg/dose IV. If infant needs an IV drip, then run dose between 0.01-1 mcg/kg/min IV.\n   d. **Internal pacing** (pacer wires are usually left in for extended period after surgery).\n\n2. Preload\n   a. Volume expanders should be readily available. Infants are at risk for minimal preload/afterload reserve.\n   b. Volume should be given in small increments and blood pressure should be monitored closely.\n\n3. Afterload Reducing Agents (decrease SVR and PVR)\n   a. **Nipride**: Dose: 0.5-2 mcg/kg/min IV\n   b. **Nitroglycerin**: Starting dose usually 0.25-0.5 mcg/kg/min IV. May titrate to 1-5 mcg/kg/min IV.\n   c. **Captopril**: Dose: Premature neonates receive 0.01 mg/kg/dose po/ng every 8-12 hrs. Infants <2 mos of age: 0.05-0.1 mg/kg/dose po/ng and titrate to 0.5 mg/kg/dose every 8 hrs.\n\n<a id='f13b3081-a944-4718-9e99-9d01b3b7753c'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Milrinone: Dose: 0.25-1 mcg/kg/min IV mixed in NS or D5W, may consider load with 50 mcg/kg IV over 20-30 min.\n\n<a id='bf0f1f80-f490-4511-bdb0-33138cbce691'></a>\n\n4. Rhythm-Changing Drugs\n\na. **Adenosine**: For SVT. Dose: 100 mcg/kg IV push increasing at 2-min intervals to maximum of 350 mcg/kg IV. Rapid administration required, run rhythm strip while administering dose to assess change in HR. For this reason, access through an upper extremity is preferred. If no change in rhythm, likely metabolized prior to reaching patient.\n\nb. **Amiodarone**: For SVT, VT, atrial flutter, and JET. Loading dose is 5-10 mg/kg IV over 20 min then maintenance infusion of 5-10 mg/kg/day.\n\nc. **Digoxin**: For CHF and some tachyarrhythmias, as well as standard of care of post-op single ventricle patients. Maintenance is 8 mcg/kg/day IV and 10 mcg/kg/day PO. Discuss with Cardiology if need for digitalization. All Digoxin orders need 2 signature.\n\nd. **Propranolol**: dysrhythmias and hypertension: Dose: Oral: 0.5-1 mg/kg/day po/ng divided every 6-8 hrs and titrate dose every 3-7 days up to 2-4 mg/kg/day. IV dose: 0.01-0.02 mg/kg IV over 10 min; may repeat every 5 min up to a cumulative dose of 0.1 mg/kg.\n\n<a id='3b7c0f29-a4b4-42a0-b14d-a5b8c75a34a4'></a>\n\n5. **Pacer Wires**\n\na. Pacer wires may remain in post-op until just prior to discharge. Discuss with CV Surgery plan for removal.\n\n   Page CVICU APP to to remove wires once indicated. A cardiac ECHO post-removal is not needed. Monitor for clinical signs of tamponade.\n\nb. Infants who experience a change in perfusion and blood pressure should be checked for dysrhythmias. If dysrhythmias are diagnosed and pacing is initiated, make sure the monitor is on \"pacer mode.\" Check the pulse and auscultate the heart rate to ensure adequate capture.\n\nc. JET and atrial tachycardia can be a problem secondary to poor AV conduction. With JET, look for cannon waves noted in the waveform of the atrial line. JET is more common post-operatively after repair of some VSDs and Tetralogy of Fallot. If temporary pacer wires are still present, obtain an atrial EKG to assess P waves.\n\n<a id='2c4ccc6f-4506-4c2a-9034-bd118e77a7f0'></a>\n\n6. Intravascular Line Management\n\na. IJ line – can be discontinued if not needed. APP or MD can de-line.\n\nb. Intracardial lines (RA, LA) – can be discontinued (by CV Surgery Fellow) if not needed. Need recent platelet count and coags prior to line being pulled (platelet > 80K, minimal coags). Need unit of PRBCs at bedside in cooler when line pulled.\n\nc. Intracardiac Broviac – removal by CT surgery.\n\n<a id='e56055cb-673d-4676-a6d5-6e18d13661da'></a>\n\nB. Respiratory Management\n\n1. Chest tubes – can be discontinued when output is < 2-3 ml/kg/day. Discontinued by Cardiac APP. Follow-up CXR 1 hr. after removal.\n\n<a id='4cfac2f0-633a-4fbe-9fc4-782ec2bc64ae'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Fluids, Electrolytes, and Nutrition Management\n\n1. When starting feedings post-operatively, feedings may be advanced per usual practice in most cardiac patients. The CVICU have a feeding pathways, simple and complex, for infants >2.5kg and these should be referenced when starting feeds in that population.\n\n   Some infants who have cardiac lesions in which blood flow to the bowel may have been compromised preoperatively are at risk for necrotizing enterocolitis. These lesions include the following: interrupted aortic arch repair, coarctation repair, aortic stenosis repair, and HLHS. In these infants, feeds should be advanced slowly and with caution.\n\n2. Other fluids should be managed similarly to the pre-op fluids mentioned above. It is important to maximize calories either in the TPN or by increasing calories and/or volume of feedings. If the infant experiences poor weight gain, and the clinical condition tolerates, fluids can be advanced to 150-160 ml/kg/day and caloric density of feeds increased to 27-30 cal/oz. Advance 2-4 cal/oz per day as tolerated to achieve adequate weight gain.\n\n3. Electrolytes should be monitored daily until stable, then weekly or twice a week if on diuretics. Maintain ionized calcium between 1.3-1.4 during the first 3-4 days; once stable 1.1-1.2 is adequate. Do not infuse calcium drips through lines with TPN or calcium through a PIV!\n\n4. Diuretics may need to be adjusted or changed as dictated by clinical findings such as pulmonary edema or intravascular depletion with Cardiology consultation.\n\n<a id='bb8ce21c-3592-4c85-9f10-4703046d9c88'></a>\n\nD. Hematology Management\n\n1. Check hematocrit at least weekly. May need to check daily if infant is unstable and/or bleeding. Use previously described transfusion parameters if infant is unstable, otherwise may allow infant to fall into more physiologic parameters. Start vitamins and iron once infant is stable on full feeds.\n2. Some infants with shunts or a patch will be on aspirin. The usual dose is 5 mg/kg/day PO/NG and should be continued at discharge.\n\n<a id='5af8ff0c-1525-48ba-ac10-1a0a3c1baba2'></a>\n\nE. **Infectious Disease Management**\n\n1. Immunizations should not be administered for at least 6 weeks post-operatively.\n\n<a id='4fd1d0d7-34f9-4bd2-a505-8d60168ee12d'></a>\n\nF. Neurologic Management\n\n1. If infant has an abnormal neurologic exam, was on ECMO or CPB or previous imaging was abnormal, then a cranial MRI may be indicated prior to discharge. MRI can be done with clips and sternal wires without time constraint. Pacer wires must be removed prior to MRI.\n2. All infants with CHD that require surgery will be followed by LPCH Infant Development Clinic and/or Early Start. The infant's local Infant Development Clinic may choose to not follow these infants.\n\n<a id='a869f551-2ecb-4c6e-af4a-69233c43d167'></a>\n\nG. Genetic Management\n\n1. If chromosomes are pending or normal, and Genetics is concerned that the infant may have a syndrome, then a follow-up exam with Genetics in 3-6 months may be requested.\n2. If infant is diagnosed with a 22q11 microdeletion, Endocrine and Immunology must be consulted, and follow-up with the Genetics and Developmental Clinics are necessary.\n\n<a id='9be90890-a71a-41e0-a4e1-431a89140afb'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Discharge Planning\n\n1.  Plan ahead as much as possible. Appointments and pharmacy prescriptions should be set up at least 2 days prior to discharge.\n2.  For discharge teaching, go to \"Micromedex\" in the computer and click on the section \"Caring for Baby/Child after Heart Surgery.\"\n3.  Parent teaching should be started early for these complex patients.\n4.  Appointments with the PCP and Cardiologist should be scheduled prior to discharge. Please send a packet of information to each that includes the admission H&P, Discharge Summary, and the Operative Note. Additionally, a copy of the last ECHO on disk should be included in the Cardiologist's packet. Follow up will not be in LPCH system.\n5.  Post-Op TOF/PA/MAPCAS\n    a. Need lung perfusion scan prior to discharge. (Place Nuclear Med Order and call 650-723-6855 to schedule)\n    b. Need discharge ECHO.\n    c. If future CV surgery required, discuss with CV3 team, the potential need to have outpatient cardiac catheterization, and possibly surgery date scheduled prior to discharge\n\n<a id='36b85cbf-1d8a-4459-abc9-fe7be435db01'></a>\n\n**Resources:**\n\n1.

Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors\n\nPhosphodiesterase (PDE) is the enzyme responsible for the breakdown of cAMP and cGMP. These inhibitors decrease cAMP and cGMP breakdown and thus affect intracellular calcium concentration resulting in an inotropic effect on the heart and vasodilation in vascular smooth muscle.\n\n<a id='d2df85ae-7954-473d-8110-85a1e666ffbd'></a>\n\nA. Milrinone (PGE5 inhibitor)\n\n1. Prevents breakdown of cyclic AMP.\n2. Increases cardiac output without increasing myocardial oxygen demand and lowers systemic vascular resistance.\n3. Not metabolized, excreted by the kidney.\n\n<a id='45e1558b-0d43-416d-941c-c47fd20d781f'></a>\n\nB. Sildenafil (PGE3 inhibitor)\n\n1. Prevents breakdown of cyclic GMP.\n2. Leads to vascular smooth muscle relaxation and research has demonstrated improvement in neonates with pulmonary hypertension. See Evaluation and Management of Pulmonary Hypertension in the BPD patient for further info.\n3. Metabolized in the liver.\n\n<a id='30d98992-144f-4aed-8155-45bfc5500bb7'></a>\n\nIII. **Vasodilators**\n\nA. **Nitroglycerin**\n\n1. A potent venous vasodilator and a less potent systemic and pulmonary artery dilator.\n2. Metabolized by rapid hepatic and vascular conversion and excreted by the kidneys. Adverse reactions include hypotension with reflex tachycardia.\n\nB. **Sodium Nitroprusside**\n\n1. Cause smooth muscle relaxation with no direct cardiac effect.\n2. Causes a greater reduction in preload and afterload than nitroglycerin.\n3. Converted to cyanide in red blood cell. Cyanide is converted to thiocyanate in liver and is excreted in the urine with a half life of 4-7 days. Therefore either liver or renal dysfunction can increase levels of toxic metabolites. The magnification of significant toxicity can occur with\n   a. Metabolic acidosis\n   b. Increased mixed venous O2 saturation\n   c. Decreased A-V O2 difference\n   d. Decreased O2 transport (Cyanmethemoglobin)\n4. Adverse reactions include cyanide and thiocyanate toxicity, hypotension, and tachycardia.\n\n<a id='ace38007-1047-4791-b21c-6ceb9e413edc'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Causes a decrease in systemic and pulmonary arterial blood pressure. Metabolized by the liver and excreted by the kidneys.\n2. Primarily used to lower pulmonary vascular resistance and increase pulmonary blood flow in children with pulmonary hypertension.\n\n<a id='80fd9af3-916c-419c-b2c2-2203dc316658'></a>\n\n## V. Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors\n\nAfterload reducing agents. Inhibit conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II in the liver. The effects of angiotensin II include vasoconstriction, augmentation of the sympathetic output, and inhibition of bradykinin, which is a vascular smooth muscle relaxant. Sodium retention is increased by activating the aldosterone system.\n\n### A. Captopril\n\n1. Lowers systemic vascular resistance and systemic blood pressure without an increase in heart rate.\n2. Metabolized in the liver and excreted in bile and by the kidneys.\n3. Hypotension is the most common side effect. Neutropenia and a persistent cough can also occur.\n4. Hyperkalemia can occur with concomitant use of spironolactone\n5. Enteral dosing only: Give at least 1 hour before meals or 2 hours after meals\n\n<a id='f115a4a5-48e8-4612-bde7-78d91ab4734f'></a>\n\n**B. Enalapril**\n\n1. Has longer elimination half-life compared to captopril, so it can be dosed daily or two times daily.\n2. An IV formulation of enalapril is available.\n3.

Beta Blockers\n\nA. Esmolol\n\n1. Short-acting beta-1 antagonist. Used to treat systemic hypertension after coarctation of the aorta repair, to reduce dynamic right- or left-sided outflow tract obstruction (e.g., Tetralogy of Fallot or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), and tachyarrhythmias (supraventricular tachycardias).\n2. Adverse effects include bradycardia, hypotension, and bronchospasm.\n3. This drug should be used with caution in patients with decreased ventricular function, when calcium channel blockers are being used, and avoided in bradycardia or atrioventricular (AV) block.\n\nB. Labetalol\n\n1. Alpha and beta blocker that is used in treatment of systemic hypertension. Adverse effects are the same as for esmolol.\n\n<a id='16256b1b-6f55-4adc-93ac-43c52d9667aa'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Used to treat arrhythmias (atrial flutter and fibrillation, A-V node re-entrant tachycardias), hypertension, Tetralogy \"spells\" (hypercyanotic episodes), and hypertrophic subaortic stenosis.\n2. Adverse effects include hypotension, impaired myocardial contractility, congestive heart failure, bradycardia, worsening of AV conduction disturbances, hypoglycemia (especially in young patients), agranulocytosis, and bronchospasm.\n3. Drug interactions include phenobarbital, rifampin, cimetidine, aluminum-containing antacids and phenothiazines.\n\n<a id='a680cb2d-e690-4fcd-a945-a06447b0b15d'></a>\n\nVIII. **Agents that Affect the Ductus Arteriosus**\n\nA. Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1)\n\n1. PGE1 use in certain lesions can lead to deterioration. These include obstructive Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Return (blood flow can be shunted away from the lungs via the PDA causing worse cyanosis) and Tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia and collaterals (maintaining a PDA plus the collaterals can cause over-circulation to the lungs), though may have some role in the initial acute management.\n2. Adverse effects include apnea (dose-related), hyperthermia, cutaneous flushing, hypotension and seizures. Prolonged use (greater than 2 wks) has been associated with antral hypertrophy and gastric outlet obstruction. Less common side effects are cortical hyperostosis and soft tissue swelling\n\n<a id='5579dc10-d0d4-4dcb-bceb-3eef238fd230'></a>\n\nB. Indomethacin\n\n1. Inhibits cyclo-oxygenase, which is a key enzyme in prostaglandin synthesis, thus helping to close the PDA in patients with a persistent PDA that does not close spontaneously.\n2. Contraindications include an elevated BUN and creatinine, and thrombocytopenia.\n3. Adverse effects include reduced renal function and urine output, decreased platelet production and decreased cerebral blood flow.\n\n<a id='be7715af-5b60-4885-946a-00bd161c82a2'></a>\n\nIX. Anticoagulants\n\nA. Heparin\n\n1. A glycosaminoglycuran that accelerates the process in which factors X, IX, XI, and XIII as well as thrombin associate with antithrombin III and are metabolized in the reticuloendothelial system.\n2. Indications include prophylaxis against thrombosis (e.g., systemic-pulmonary artery shunts) and treatment of deep vein thrombosis or femoral artery thrombosis.\n3. Treatment goal typically is to maintain the partial thromboplastin time (PTT) 1.5-2.5 times normal and Heparin activity level between 0.3-0.7.\n4. Bleeding due to excessive heparin effect can be reversed by protamine sulfate (1 mg/100 units of heparin).\n\n<a id='486f18e5-d522-4937-831c-f1df1babf99c'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Activates plasminogen to plasmin in the presence of fibrin. It is different from urokinase and streptokinase as it does not have much effect on fibrinogen and has less systemic effects. Mostly used in treatment of adult myocardial infarction patients. Also used in treatment for coronary arterial thrombosis in Kawasaki disease, Blalock-Taussing shunts, femoral arterial occlusion after cardiac catheterization, right atrial thrombus associated with central venous catheters, and vena caval thrombosis.\n\n<a id='ebcef8f4-7d6c-44e0-b924-401694384275'></a>\n\nXI. **Digoxin**\n\nA. Increases the availability of intracellular calcium for myocardial contraction. Used for myocardial dysfunction as well as an antiarrhythmic agent. Contraindicated in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\n\nB. **Toxicity:**\n1. Digoxin toxicity can occur at serum level > 2 ng/ml.\n2. Increased incidence of toxic effects with hypokalemia and following calcium bolus dose.\n3. Decrease dosing with simultaneous use of quinidine, verapamil, or amiodarone.\n\nC. **Side effects:** bradycardia, atrioventricular block, ventricular arrhythmias and tachycardia.\n\n<a id='3992eb32-42e2-4636-bd44-de38f31f7a42'></a>\n\n## XII.

Arrhythmia\n\nOverall fairly uncommon in the neonatal population other than sinus arrhythmia, isolated premature atrial contractions (PACs) and isolated premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). The normal pacemaker of the heart is the sinus node, with the AV node and the ventricle as two other potential pacemaker sites. These pacemaker sites have lower rates than the sinus node, however they will take over if the sinus node slows or fails. Complexes generated from the ventricle usually will be wider than those from the atria since the cells initially depolarize cell to cell rather than fully through the His-purkinje system.\n\n<a id='f4f33277-2d43-4b96-9858-0745545e8d50'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Tachycardias originating in the atrium\n\n1. Atrial tachycardia\n\nTachycardia that originates in the atria. Reentrant tachycardias are more commonly found in neonates than automatic tachycardias. Atrial tachycardias are often narrow complex as the impulse depolarizes utilizing the His-purkinje system. If part of the His-Purkinje System is refractory when the signal arrives, the tachycardia may be wide complex (aberrancy)\n\na. Reentrant supraventricular tachycardia - most commonly caused by an accessory pathway, e.g. Wolff Parkinson White. Regular rate, break the circuit with vagal maneuvers, adenosine or DC cardioversion. If atrial wires are in place, can overdrive atrial pace to break the circuit. Medications for control include propranolol and digoxin (though digoxin avoided in patients with WPW)\n\n<::ECG strip illustrating reentrant supraventricular tachycardia\n: chart::>\n\nb. Ectopic atrial tachycardia - Automatic focus within the atria. Irregular, does not usually break with adenosine or DC cardioversion as there is no circuit to interrupt. Consider administering sedation to decrease catecholamines during initial management. Medical management includes amiodarone, propranolol and digoxin.

The ductus is usually functionally closed within 12 hrs of life. Anatomic closure normally occurs within 10 days. In the premature infant, closure often will not occur until term.\n\nB. Left-to-right shunting through the ductus may contribute to increasing pulmonary edema, persistent need for ventilator support, and the development of BPD. Decreased systemic perfusion to end organs like brain, kidney, and intestines may also occur. These potential complications have traditionally been the motivation to achieve ductal closure.\n\nC. It remains unclear if treatment of a PDA results in improved long-term outcomes. Recent analyses have shown that treatment of a PDA does NOT reduce the common complications of prematurity including death, BPD, IVH, or NEC1. Risks of medical or surgical closure also exist. Therefore, determination of the hemodynamic significance of the PDA in a particular patient is essential in decision making until further evidence from clinical studies can be acquired to guide optimal treatment.\n\n<a id='6742de62-384d-47dc-b92c-5adb2f802a55'></a>\n\nII. **Diagnosis**\n\nA. **Clinical Signs and Symptoms**\n\nSuspect a hemodynamically significant PDA in premature infants when there is:\n\n1.  A systolic or continuous \"grating\" murmur heard in the LUSB.\n2.  Bounding pulses (often palmar pulses are palpated).\n3.  Wide pulse pressure (>20 mmHg) with low diastolic pressure.\n4.  Difficulty weaning from the ventilator (above what is expected for typical RDS picture). Increased PaCO2 may be the only finding.\n5.  CHF, cardiomegaly, and pulmonary edema visible on CXR.\n6.  Metabolic acidosis.\n7.  Feeding intolerance\n8.  Oliguria, rising creatinine levels\n\n**NOTE**: Sometimes a PDA is asymptomatic\n\n<a id='52511ebb-c17e-4b18-8276-80994f076c6d'></a>\n\nB. Echocardiographic Findings\n\nConfirmation of clinical suspicion is by echocardiogram:\n\n1. ECHO characteristics to consider include size of the duct, direction of blood flow (left-to-right, bidirectional), and other indicators of hemodynamic significance such as elevated left atrial to aortic root regurgitation.\n2. The ECHO will only capture a moment in time. As the PDA is dynamic, multiple ECHO studies may be necessary for clinical correlation.\n\n<a id='c000ca75-fcc8-4dd9-8960-e576c27e4157'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Conservative Management:** Consider awaiting spontaneous closure with conservative management.\n\n1. Limit the fluid volume to the essential amount necessary to meet estimated needs, but still maintain adequate growth (typically 120-150 ml/kg/d).\n2. Diuretic therapy may be necessary to minimize pulmonary edema.\n3. Treat hypotension with pressors.\n4. Maintain higher positive airway distending pressures.\n5. Consider blood transfusions to maintain adequate systemic oxygenation.\n6.

Indomethacin (0.2 mg/kg/dose) every 12 hrs for 3 doses. May repeat course if labs and renal function stable and per Attending preference.\n2. Pre-indocin labs: creatinine, platelets. Indocin may impair renal perfusion and decrease platelet function. Labs should be checked prior to each dose.\n3. Doses contraindicated if platelets <100K, Cr >1.5, urine output <0.5 mL/kg/hr, NEC, hemorrhage or if\n\n<a id='ce8363ec-9358-41fb-a9d0-281b674b156c'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Not contraindicated in IVH.\n4. Closure rate is 65-75%. Some will re-open especially with increased intravenous fluid volume. Indocin is less effective after the first 2 weeks of life.\n5. Other centers may use ibuprofen instead of indomethacin for PDA closure due to a similar efficacy rate, but improved perfusion to kidneys, brain, and intestines.\n\n<a id='39517142-facd-4011-8946-41b41d075077'></a>\n\nC. Surgical Management:\n\n1. For those with failed medical management or with contraindications to indomethacin, surgical ligation at the bedside by the CV Surgery team may be indicated.\n2. It is recommended that surgical ligation be delayed until the infant is at least 30 days of age. The decision for surgical ligation should be made after Cardiology consultation. Catheter-based closure may be an option for older infants.\n3. Consider need for stress-dose hydrocortisone prior to surgery. Infants are at risk for impaired cerebral autoregulation in the 6 hours following ligation. ³\n4. Complications of surgical ligation include risks of anesthesia, vocal cord paralysis, pneumothorax, myocardial dysfunction, infection, and bleeding. Long-term complications may include an increased risk of BPD and neurodevelopmental impairment.\n\n<a id='bc53775e-6019-4829-8678-c14649a4b90d'></a>\n\nD. Prophylactic Management for PDA:\n\nSome centers use Indomethacin for preterm infants in the first 24 hours of life at 0.1 mg/kg/dose every 24° x 6 doses.

Background\n\nDespite changes in the nature and epidemiology of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), patients with BPD are more likely to develop pulmonary hypertension (PH) than those without, and the morbidity and mortality associated with PH in this population remains high. Even in the \"post-surfactant era,\" in severe cases of late PH mortality rates near 70% are reported. PH also contributes to the cardiopulmonary abnormalities seen in BPD patients, including decreased right ventricular (RV) function, reduced cardiac output, limited oxygen delivery, and increased pulmonary edema. Moreover, PH affects the development of the lung circulation in BPD patients, leading to persistent abnormal lung growth via a reduction in number (impaired angiogenesis) and an altered pattern of distribution of small pulmonary arteries within the lung interstitium. The arterial tree has increased vascular tone and has undergone hypertensive remodeling. In this population, reduced alveolarization along with the simplification of the distal lung airspaces results in a decreased overall alveolar-capillary surface area. PH has a significant effect on the clinical course of BPD due to these effects on lung development. Patients develop elevated pulmonary vascular resistance and abnormal vasoreactivity, as demonstrated by their marked vasoconstrictor response to acute hypoxia, which persists late into the course of the disease. They also often have a prolonged need for oxygen and ventilator therapy. During respiratory infections or exercise, they can have profound hypoxemia; likewise, relatively minor amounts of right to left shunting can lead to significant hemodynamic compromise.\n\n<a id='b8bcc791-43f9-494e-94de-99b53b3e3564'></a>\n\n## II. Evaluation and Diagnosis\n\nA. Diagnosis of PH can be difficult in BPD patients given the subtle symptoms and the overlap with signs consistent with primary respiratory abnormalities. Early detection, though, may provide important prognostic information as well as allow for early aggressive therapy to improve late outcomes. Unfortunately, little data exists regarding the incidence and natural history of PH in BPD patients and PH in the setting of BPD is ill-defined. Echocardiography remains the best non-invasive screening tool for PH, but in the absence of tricuspid regurgitation, is not a reliable estimate of pulmonary artery pressure. In such cases, severity of PH may be estimated using qualitative findings, such as flattening of the interventricular septum, presence of shunts, evidence of pulmonary venous obstruction, and LV and RV size and function.\n\n<a id='4a086208-f1bc-4803-845a-aee1cfec9abe'></a>\n\n**B. Recommendations at this time for PH screening are:**\n\n1. Early screening echocardiograms can be performed as early as 7-10 days of age in premature infants with:\n   a. Severe respiratory distress syndrome (RDS)\n   b. High levels of ventilator support and oxygen need\n   c. Oligohydramnios\n   d. Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR)\n   e. Slow rate of clinical improvement (ie, persistent or progressively increased need for respiratory support)\n\n<a id='6ced4069-ab0f-46c5-9813-696ffd856399'></a>\n\n2.

Recurrent hospitalizations\n   d. Elevated PaCO2\n   e. Persistent pulmonary edema requiring frequent use of diuretics\n\n<a id='e3db3612-1e1b-45f9-ba94-0911ef92a284'></a>\n\nC. If the patient is clinically stable and the echocardiogram is normal or shows subtle signs of mild PH, serial echocardiograms are recommended every 1-2 months while hospitalized and on oxygen therapy (if outpatient, can be obtained every 2-4 months) and again within 2 months of being weaned off oxygen.\n\n<a id='e9297ecf-3a40-4abf-8527-2e70d1b641b2'></a>\n\nD. For patients whose echocardiograms show signs of PH, the Pulmonary Hypertension team should be consulted and may initially recommend serial echocardiograms every 1-2 weeks. Cardiac catheterization and/or high resolution chest CT may be appropriate if patients:\n\n1. Have persistent signs of cardiopulmonary disease or clinical deterioration not related to airway disease.\n2. Are suspected of having significant PH despite optimal management of lung disease and associated complications.\n3. Are a candidate for prolonged PH drug therapy\n4. Have unexplained and recurrent pulmonary edema\n\n<a id='9b8d3dcb-c79d-4b7e-827d-f80667bd99c6'></a>\n\nE. Goals of advanced imaging:\n\n1. Exclude or document the severity of associated anatomic cardiac lesions, including the presence of intracardiac shunts or pulmonary artery stenosis\n\n2. Define the presence of systemic-pulmonary collateral vessels (including their size), pulmonary venous obstruction (e.g. pulmonary vein stenosis), or left heart dysfunction. Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction can lead to recurrent pulmonary edema and poor response to inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) therapy.\n\n3. Obtain a structural assessment of the pulmonary arterial and venous circulations by angiography\n\n4. Assess the severity of PH\n\n5. Assess pulmonary vascular reactivity in patients who fail to respond to oxygen therapy alone. Acute vasoreactivity testing should be performed to determine the patient's response to vasodilating agents (iNO 20-40 ppm while on 100% FiO2 oxygen), possibly establishing targeted therapy for the patient and\n\n<a id='297ac9f2-8772-45ff-951b-97ee0f7853cb'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Sleep studies, flexible bronchoscopy, upper gastrointestinal series, pH probe/impedance studies, and/or swallow studies may be indicated to evaluate for chronic reflux, aspiration, structural airway abnormalities, bronchoreactivity, and lung edema.\n2. Oxygen saturations should be in the target range of 92-95%.\n\n<a id='c97b57de-e15e-4f2e-9e20-05542e8f49ec'></a>\n\nB. Inhaled Nitric Oxide (iNO)\n\n1. Causes selective pulmonary vasodilation\n2. Acute improvement in pulmonary hemodynamics has been demonstrated during cardiac catheterization. Long term, low-dose therapy has not been fully studied, but early work has shown that doses as low as 2 ppm can normalize pulmonary pressures more effectively than calcium channel blockers. Lower doses (2-10 ppm) may further enhance ventilation-perfusion mismatch, allowing for improved oxygenation at lower FiO2.\n3. Starting dose: 10-20 ppm\n\n<a id='30ebc68f-170f-407e-ad9e-336662d6aa3d'></a>\n\n## C. Sildenafil\n\n1.

Data in children are limited, but includes studies showing improvement of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) and of older children undergoing long-term therapy. However, studies in non-BPD pediatric populations have shown highly variable absorption and efficacy. It may be helpful in augmenting the effect of iNO and/or facilitating the weaning off iNO.\n3. Starting dose: 0.5 mg/kg/dose q8h. If no systemic hypotension develops, dose can be increased to a maximum of 1 mg/kg/dose q8h.\n\n<a id='c83f3bf9-7ae4-4577-a7bf-044477b32ea9'></a>\n\nD. Endothelin-Receptor Antagonists (Bosentan)\n\n1. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a potent vasoconstrictor and smooth muscle mitogen that has been linked to the pathogenesis of PH in term infants with PPHN and CDH, as well as premature infants with RDS.\n2. Bosentan acts as an antagonist to the receptor of ET-1, thereby inhibiting vasoconstriction. It has been shown to be safe and effective in children as young as 9 months, but its use in BPD is limited to case studies.\n3. Starting dose: 1 mg/kg/dose BID.

The Gann Act and Informed Consent\n\nA. What is the Gann Act?\n\n1. The Paul Gann Blood Safety Act (Health and Safety Code Section 1645) requires that physicians or nurse practitioners provide patients with a state-produced handout, \"A Patient's Guide to Blood Transfusions,” whenever there is the possibility that a blood transfusion will be necessary. This handout describes the risks and benefits of autologous, designated (also known as directed), and non-designated allogeneic blood donations. This brochure should be given in addition to having the parent or guardian sign informed consent.\n\n<a id='37f1a72a-247d-4a87-ab7d-194b92f80547'></a>\n\nB. Who should be notified?\n\n1.  Parents whose children are in the NICU receive a general information packet upon admission from either the bedside nurse or the unit clerk. Within this packet is a letter explaining the possible need for blood product transfusion, the types of transfusion, as well as options for directed donation.\n2.  The Gann Act should be discussed with parents of infants with a reasonable likelihood of requiring a transfusion. If an infant has a low likelihood for needing blood products (e.g., rule-out sepsis patients), the Gann Act does not need to be discussed.\n3.  In the case of an emergency transfusion, the Gann Act does not apply, but if further transfusions are anticipated, the above procedure should be followed\n\n<a id='d64cf7d8-cf4a-4f11-8db1-143ae8a76566'></a>\n\nC. Documentation of the Gann Act and Informed Consent\n\n1. The Physician, Nurse Practitioner or Transport Specialist who makes first contact with the parents/guardian should inform them about the possibility of transfusion and provide them with the written information about blood product transfusion.\n2. This may not be possible in the case of infants transported in from outside hospitals with an outside transport team. The physician or nurse practitioner should then provide parents with the written information when they arrive in our NICU.\n3. The provider must document in EPIC (\"Order Transfusion Consent & Gann Act\") the date they obtained consent for blood transfusion and that the Gann Act was provided and discussed with the patient/parent/guardian. If not already done, the consent order and Gann Act order will be displayed at the time of the first blood product order and mandatory for the provider to complete. The consent order and Gann Act order are required once per admission for all patients. Except for emergencies, written consent must also be obtained from a parent prior to transfusion and this paper consent should be placed in the infant's chart\n\n<a id='266684b4-8244-4704-82bd-fbbaaff032f3'></a>\n\n## II. Blood Product Information\n\n### A. General information\n\n1. Blood products must be ordered via EPIC, most commonly in the General Blood Administration Order set.\n2. The patient's ABO/Rh type and antibody screen are required prior to receiving cross-matched blood products. ABO/Rh typing must be performed on two separate blood draws on two separate occasions in\n\n<a id='6440e0c8-7e83-4564-b321-69009780e0c2'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital. No representations or warranties are made for outside use. Not for outside reproduction or publication without permission.\n\n<a id='674b5fa0-c4e1-4645-a4ad-09939b4d0bff'></a>\n\n### Blood Product Ordering and Transfusion Practices 227\n\norder to confirm the ABO type to prevent ABO incompatible transfusion from misidentification errors. All infants admitted to the NICU should have an initial ABO/Rh sent with the first blood draw performed for other clinical indications (note: if labs are not indicated, there is no need to send an ABO/Rh). For patients who may need blood product components, ABO/Rh type must be verified by a second sample drawn at a separate time. Historical typing performed at LPCH will meet the requirement for 1 of the 2 ABO/Rh types (though this is an unlikely circumstance for the majority of NICU admissions).\n\n<a id='30f35edb-5edb-4a61-93ec-19cbf8dd9cfe'></a>\n\n3. All cellular blood products (red blood cells and platelets) for newborn < 4 months are irradiated and leukoreduced. Additionally, premature infants <35 weeks gestation receive CMV negative products. The attributes of the blood products are automatically chosen based on patient diagnosis (see below).\n\n4. The patient's diagnosis should be indicated in the order. The required \"Comorbidity\" entry is typically a newborn <4 months, but additional comorbidities may be present, depending on the individual clinical situation (e.g., ECMO <4 months). The provider must chose multiple co-morbidities if applicable. The volume of blood product component must be entered separately in both the nursing \"order to transfuse\" and blood product order.\n\n5. When blood products are needed within one hour of the order, place the order STAT.\n\n6. In case of an extreme emergency, providers should order uncrossmatched blood via the Emergency Release Blood Product order set in EPIC and a phone call notifying the Transfusion Service Charge Tech (723-6445) should be made. A runner must be sent to the Transfusion Service with the correct patient label to pick up the emergency blood products.\n\n7. For blood ordering practices for ECMO, see NICU Guide Section II.B.6 \"ECMO”.\n\n<a id='43f5227b-af09-4cf2-b407-05b8af95be78'></a>\n\nB. Packed red blood cells (PRBCs)\n\n1. Patients typically receive 10-15 mL/kg PBRCs depending on the starting and target hematocrits. Patients usually receive type-specific blood, and always ABO compatible even in the case of uncrossmatched emergencies. The blood may be infused over 1-4 hrs as determined by the hemodynamic status of the patient. PRBCs expire 4 hours after they are issued from the Transfusion Service. Consider administration of a diuretic following transfusion in fluid-sensitive patients.\n2. Potassium leaks from PRBCs during storage, especially after irradiation. The amount of free potassium in a small aliquot (10-15 mL/kg) PRBC transfusion is not clinically significant. In the case of massive transfusion or in patients with reduced ability to handle potassium (e.g., renal failure, acidosis), transient hyperkalemia may occur and washing of cells is appropriate if fresh RBC units less than 10 days old are not available. Please call the Transfusion Service or page the Transfusion Service physician at 12027 to assist with ordering of washed PRBCs if indicated.\n3. The hematocrit of PRBC transfusions is approximately 55-60%. Occasionally, \"dry\" PRBCs are indicated to limit the volume of incompatible plasma infused. These \"dry packed units\" have a hematocrit of approximately 85% and require dilution with normal saline prior to use. Instructions for dilution are sent attached to the \"dry packed\" PRBCs from the Transfusion Service.\n4. Indications for PRBC transfusion are patient-specific. In general, the need for transfusion increases with respiratory or cardiac instability. Please discuss transfusion indications with the Attending.\n\n<a id='ea412720-8c28-495c-ba01-8c483406a515'></a>\n\nC. **Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and plasma frozen within 24 hrs (FP24)**\n\n1. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is plasma frozen within 6-8 hrs of collection. It contains all coagulant factors as well as albumin and immunoglobulins. Plasma frozen within 24 hrs (FP24) is approved by the FDA and AABB and can be used interchangeably with FFP. In North America, FP24 has largely replaced FFP.\n\n<a id='aeeed01d-1e00-4a7a-ad26-fb6dfdb886e4'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital. No representations or warranties are made for outside use. Not for outside reproduction or publication without permission.\n\n<a id='b8939f20-5615-4994-83c3-246519d8342d'></a>\n\n228 Part II-D: Hematology\n\n2. FFP and FP24 are free of leukocytes, RBCs, and platelets. ABO-compatible plasma must be used. Remember, AB plasma (not O) is the universally compatible plasma product.\n3. The usual dose of FFP or F24 is 10-15 mL/kg over 30 min, though longer infusion times are permissible.\n4. The indications for FFP include DIC, liver disease and therapeutic plasma exchange.\n\n<a id='c5e3640a-b90f-4a92-830c-fdf9f73d05d3'></a>\n\nD. Platelets\n\n1. Platelets are available in \"apheresis\" units only at Stanford. Each apheresis unit is equivalent to 6 random donor pooled platelets (which are not available at Stanford). A whole apheresis unit is approximately 250 mL. Platelets are ordered by volume, not units, in the neonatal population (10-15 mL/kg). For a volume less than 90 ml, a syringe aliquot (10-90 ml) will be prepared in the transfusion service. Platelets expire 4 hours after issue and are infused over 30-60 minutes.\n\n2. In some cases, only ABO-incompatible platelets will be available. If more than 15 mL of platelets are ordered, they will be \"packed\" by the Transfusion Service to reduce the amount of ABO-incompatible plasma given to the patient. Transfusion Service will place a sticker on the bag indicating that the volume of platelets transfused should not exceed 5 mL/kg. It is an acceptable clinical decision, however, to transfuse more than 5mL/kg of ABO-incompatible platelets in a patient who needs more platelets.\n\n3. The threshold for platelet transfusion varies according to the patient's clinical situation. Examples of appropriate indications include any infant with active bleeding, a premature infant at risk for intracranial hemorrhage or any infant at risk for post-operative bleeding. Please discuss patient-specific transfusion indications with the Attending.\n\n<a id='24cfbfa8-2be0-4919-84c2-e1ff528a901b'></a>\n\nE. Cryoprecipitate AHF (Cryo)\n\n1.  Cryoprecipitate AHF (anti-hemophilic factor) contains fibrinogen, factor VIII (8), von Willebrand's factor, factor XIII (13), and fibronectin. The primary clinical indication for transfusion with cryo is hypofibrinogenemia (fibrinogen <150).\n2.  Cryo is supplied in units of 10-15 mL. Neonates receive 1 unit per 10kg of body weight never to exceed 10 units (the adult dose), infused over 30 minutes. Most neonates only require 1 unit. Transfusion Services will provide ABO-compatible cryo if possible, though it is not required to be ABO-compatible.\n\n<a id='a8f70d1e-3af4-40ae-83f0-3c9054e9ea4a'></a>\n\nIII. Types of donated blood\n\nA. Autologous donation\n\nAutologous donation occurs in the setting of anticipated transfusion, where an adult donates in advance of a planned surgical procedure. This circumstance is not applicable to the NICU setting.\n\nB. Community donation\n\nBlood products (all blood types and components) are donated by volunteers who are not paid. All donors are screened with a questionnaire and the blood is tested for the following: ABO/Rh type, CMV, antibody to Hepatitis C, Hepatitis B surface antigen, antibody to Hepatitis B core protein, antibody to HIV, antibody to HTLV-I/II, and antibody to Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite that causes Chagas Disease. Pooled donor specimens are also tested for Hepatitis C, HIV, and West Nile Virus RNA and Hepatitis B DNA (nucleic acid testing or NAT).\n\n<a id='8495ccb2-1e20-49d4-9138-70938c449ed7'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital. No representations or warranties are made for outside use. Not for outside reproduction or publication without permission.\n\n<a id='790b63d2-6038-4b71-8710-b9a8f6ac84d5'></a>\n\nCAPTION ERROR\n\n<a id='89c70698-4cb4-4fcd-a0d4-7beea7f5ac57'></a>\n\n## C. Directed donation\n\n1.  Directed donation comes from a qualified donor who is a parent or other person chosen by the family. Studies indicate that directed donors have similar or higher rates of infectious disease markers compared to volunteer donors. Therefore, directed blood is NOT safer than volunteer blood. A possible reason for this discrepancy is that directed donors may feel under pressure to donate and may not admit to risk factors. For this reason, parents should not be pressured to provide directed donors on behalf of their child. There may also be circumstances where directed blood is not appropriate due to HLA-sensitization issues (e.g., anticipated organ transplant from a family member).\n\n2.  Directed donations require a written order from a physician or nurse practitioner. A physician/NNP may place an order by faxing a written order to the Special Donations Department at the Stanford Blood Center (fax 650-723-8155). The intended donor must contact Special Donations (phone 650-723-6667) to make an appointment to donate. Please see the website bloodcenter.stanford.edu to obtain the order form and for more information.\n\n3.  Order \"CMV negative\" (i.e., CMV antibody negative) blood for the following infants: <35 weeks gestation, infants with suspected severe immunodeficiency (e.g. DiGeorge, SCID), infants born to mothers with HIV infection and infants with complex congenital heart disease.\n\n**NOTE**: Only about 50% of donors will be CMV antibody negative. If \"CMV negative\" is required for an infant receiving a directed donation, and the donor is found to be CMV antibody positive, the unit will NOT be used for the infant.\n\nNormal full-term infants do not require CMV antibody negative blood components. All directed donations will be leukoreduced, which reduces the risk of CMV transmission.\n\n<a id='fd1f3244-857f-46ac-95b4-212a3e389ce3'></a>\n\n4. Considerations\n\na. The shelf life of directed units may be shorter than units from community donors because all directed units are irradiated. The shelf life is limited to 28 days or less if the directed units need to be manipulated because of plasma incompatibility.\n\nb. A mother may be permitted to donate red blood cells on behalf of her child if her hemoglobin is high enough and her obstetrician provides written authorization.\n\nc. All directed donors including the mother must be screened carefully with questions about risk factors as well as blood testing for infectious diseases. About 15% of individuals presenting to donate do not meet donor eligibility criteria.\n\nd. Individuals with a history of pregnancy or transfusion are not permitted to donate plasma products (FFP, FP24 and platelets). This includes mothers of newborn infants. This policy was put in place by the FDA to reduce the incidence of Transfusion Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI), now the most common cause of transfusion-related fatality. TRALI is often associated with donor antibodies to WBC antigens (HLA and granulocyte antigens); these antibodies are most commonly induced by pregnancy.\n\n<a id='efa225ca-d53d-435e-a110-556f6b53c748'></a>\n\nIV. **Transfusion Reactions**\n\nA. Transfusion reactions are extremely rare in newborns. Symptoms of a transfusion reaction may include fever, respiratory distress, hypotension, and acidosis.\nB. In the event of any clinical problems during a blood transfusion, discontinue the transfusion, fill out a \"Possible Transfusion Reaction Report,\" and return the unit to the Transfusion Service.\n\n<a id='443d9f8f-e409-4da6-8277-10101ddc6a50'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Factors that place these infants at risk include: disordered bilirubin-albumin binding, starvation, and/or decreased enteral intake leading to decreased gastrointestinal (GI) activity resulting in increased enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin. Contributing physiologic conditions include: a damaged blood-brain barrier, asphyxia, acidosis, and hypoalbuminemia. Thus, bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction or BIND may occur at lower total serum/plasma bilirubin (TB) levels than those for term and healthy infants. DO NOT SUBTRACT THE DIRECT BILIRUBIN VALUE FROM THE TB LEVEL TO CALCULATE THE INDIRECT BILIRUBIN VALUE FOR CLINICAL DECISIONS UNLESS DIRECT BILIRUBIN IS >50% OF TB.\n\n<a id='a0cdb78e-2f12-4646-9de5-37c1328a0161'></a>\n\nA.

Clinical Manifestations\n\nJaundice can be detected by using digital pressure to blanch the skin at the forehead, sternum, iliac crest, patella, or malleolus to reveal the underlying skin and subcutaneous tissue color. Jaundice should be assessed whenever the infant's vital signs are being measured, but no less than every 8 to 12 hrs. The assessment of visible jaundice must be done in a well-lit room or, preferably, in daylight with ambient sunlight. The degree of jaundice can vary in color from lemon yellow to bright orange and sienna. Accuracy of assessment may be limited by an infant's skin pigmentation, plethora, and previous exposure to sun or phototherapy as well as decreased ambient light during assessment. It must be remembered that the absence of jaundice is not an indication of the absence of hyperbilirubinemia. In addition, estimating the degree of hyperbilirubinemia can lead to errors. The absence or severity of jaundice is not predictive of subsequent severe hyperbilirubinemia\n\n<a id='dc14fda1-15d0-413f-b053-ed0a24651068'></a>\n\na. Onset of jaundice in first 24 hrs of life should be considered a sign of an excessive rate of rise of TB and an indication for STAT TB level and further evaluation.\nb. Jaundice is usually observed first in the face and then caudally in the trunk and extremities. It can sometimes appear and fade similar to a tan.\n\n<a id='39114c99-17e3-4c6a-b3f0-03de22a88901'></a>\n\nB. Testing\n\nTB is measured in the serum or plasma. In term and late preterm infants, the TB level can be plotted on the Bhutani nomogram to identify the infant's percentile risk zone in combination with assessment of clinical risk factors. The Bhutani nomogram provides a more appropriate understanding of the magnitude of the hyperbilirubinemia and a projected TB ROR as a function of postnatal age (in hrs) as defined for healthy infants. A transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) measurement is a noninvasive alternative to a TB measurement. TcB devices are useful screening tools and provide a valid estimate of TB levels (up to 12.5 mg/dL), although data are limited\n\n<a id='e2b8b123-1975-4c79-b7ff-dc63b3f66331'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Effective Phototherapy\n\n1. Background Information\n\n**THIS MODE OF TREATMENT DOES NOT EMIT UV LIGHT**\n\nThe optimal light source is blue light within a narrow range wavelength (460-490 nm; such as that provided by blue light-emitting diodes [LEDs]) that is distributed evenly to one plane of the body (and can be increased to both ventral and dorsal planes or even, circumferential) at an irradiance of >30 to <35 µW/cm²/nm in infants > 28 wks GA. Photodegradation of bilirubin by blue light exposure is almost immediate and may not reflect measured TB levels. Multiple light sources are available to cover a wider surface area with a uniform footprint of irradiance. Avoid shadows with multiple lights and other interferences for optimal light exposure. Avoid exposure to UV lights (such as fluorescent tubes).\n\n<a id='e34478c4-2525-4f7f-96b0-b95569b173d8'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

Clinical Approach to Unconjugated Hyperbilirubinemia 237\nFor well infants 35 to 37⁶/⁷ wks, can adjust TB levels for intervention around the medium risk line. It is an option to intervene at lower TB levels for infants closer to 35 wks and at higher TB levels for those closer to 37⁶/⁷ wks.\n\nd. It is an option to provide conventional phototherapy in hospital or at home at TB levels 2 to 3 mg/dL below those shown, but home phototherapy should not be used in any infant with risk factors.\n\n<a id='1bad7d16-3c1b-4a02-9d6c-81b1ab7a0606'></a>\n\nC. \"Crash-Cart\" Approach for an Infant Readmitted for Severe Hyperbilirubinemia\n\n1.

Prepare for an exchange transfusion (look for line placement sites)\n5. Evaluate for concurrent dehydration (such as hypernatremia): IV infusions will not lower TB levels\n6. Continue enteral feeds to decrease enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin. Breastfeeding can be done with infant (and mother) under phototherapy. Because the baby will be unwrapped to maximize skin exposure to light, heat lamps may be needed to maintain temperature.\n\n<a id='b92d4083-62f1-4263-8b20-643a9ee2c514'></a>\n\nTable 4: Considerations for a \"Crash-Cart\" Approach\n<table id=\"44-1\">\n<tr><td id=\"44-2\">Options</td><td id=\"44-3\">Identify the most effective means to minimize brain damage</td></tr>\n<tr><td id=\"44-4\">Risk</td><td id=\"44-5\">Weigh against the potential risk of ABE versus exchange transfusion</td></tr>\n<tr><td id=\"44-6\">Pre-treatment</td><td id=\"44-7\">Start total body phototherapy (while procedures are being done) Consider IVIG for isoimmunization Consider albumin infusion (1 g/kg) for hypoalbuminemia (< 3.4 g/dL)</td></tr>\n<tr><td id=\"44-8\">Procedure</td><td id=\"44-9\">Isovolume double volume exchange (170 mL/kg in term, 190 mL/kg in preterm infants)</td></tr>\n<tr><td id=\"44-a\">Duration</td><td id=\"44-b\">May be accomplished within 3 to 4 hrs (consent, labs, lines, and procedures)</td></tr>\n<tr><td id=\"44-c\">Technical problems</td><td id=\"44-d\">A single volume exchange transfusion may be adequate until technical problems are resolved.</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<a id='c882dbde-eee2-4458-807e-0781f1df4b2c'></a>\n\nD. Management of Hyperbilirubinemia in Sick and Preterm Infants\n\nThe primary strategy for clinical management of sick and preterm infants is prevention. Jaundice should be monitored along with other vital signs. TB measurements should be done every 8 to 12 hrs; can be decreased to every 12 to 24 hrs if infant is under phototherapy, when TB levels are decreasing, or when the infant is beyond 1 wk of age. Sick and preterm infants may be at increased risk during an acute rise of bilirubin with concurrent infection or illness, when NPO, or as a result of a transfusion or acute hemolysis\n\n<a id='48b41287-9016-473a-9472-103e3a98e26f'></a>\n\nCAPTION ERROR\n\n<a id='dc83a8d1-e73a-4cdb-966a-3ee6908a65cb'></a>\n\n238 Part II-D: Hematology\nTable 5.

Activation of coagulation in sepsis\n3. \"Low flow\" scenarios (e.g., shock, low cardiac output)\n4. Surgery/trauma\n5. Maternal diabetes mellitus\n6. Congenital heart disease\n7. Renal or hepatic function abnormalities\n\nB. Neonatal thrombosis is usually associated with line placements or attempts (umbilical, femoral/cardiac catheterization), but may also be seen in unusual sites or high-flow vessels.\n\n1. IVC, femoral veins, SVC\n2. CNS sinuses\n3. Aorta, femoral arteries, renal arteries\n4. Middle cerebral artery\n\nC. Thrombosis may be multifactorial; however, a genetic/inherited thrombophilic condition may be present that predisposes the infant to thrombosis in the setting of specific medical conditions. Unfortunately, it is not usually possible from the clinical presentation alone to ascertain which patient with a thrombus has an inherited condition. It may be important to identify patients with thrombophilias for long-term management, and for family counseling.\n\n<a id='5897a53a-ca06-428a-8e78-b6bc4c02c7b0'></a>\n\nII. **Purpose of Suggested Guidelines for Work-up**\n\nTo develop a strategy whereby meaningful diagnostic studies are consistently performed in infants with documented thrombotic phenomenon so that thrombophilias may be identified early, and proper treatment and counseling can take place\n\n<a id='bd89f814-0cf2-416a-97e1-f27b18a6608a'></a>\n\n### III. Suggested Guidelines\n\nA. Patient identification\n\n1. Thrombi are most often identified in the neonatal period by an ultrasound obtained after clinical suspicion of thrombus (e.g., extremity swelling). Occasionally, a thrombus may be detected as an incidental finding.\n2. There are no clear guidelines of the size, type or site of thrombus that should absolutely lead to a complete\n\n<a id='601d3f8e-bcb5-4ec3-96b3-d4f03b954b47'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.

However, suggested scenarios that might prompt work-up include:\n\na. Unprovoked thromboemboli (i.e., no catheter or line attempts near the thrombus site) or is in any \"unusual\" site.\nb. Recurrent thromboemboli\nc. A strong family history of thromboemboli (i.e., myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accidents in family members < 50 years, deep vein thrombi, pulmonary embolism, recurrent miscarriages).\n\n<a id='217f20a6-4f06-4767-bcf1-61e80a833f44'></a>\n\n3. Recent literature indicates that a thrombophilia work-up is not indicated as part of the evaluation for a perinatal stroke.\n\n<a id='ab6d577a-bfed-4a8d-839b-c7917313551b'></a>\n\nB. Approach\n\n1.  Obtain a thorough family clotting/ischemia history.\n2.  Recommended \"special\" tests for a thrombophilia work-up include:\n    a. Factor V Leiden: 1 ml blood/purple-top tube\n    b. Prothrombin mutation analysis: 1 ml blood/purple-top tube\n    c. Serum homocysteine concentration. If abnormal follow with MTHFR gene mutation analysis\n3.  Consider a work-up on the mother:\n    a. Lupus anticoagulant 3 ml blood/blue-top tube\n    b. Antiphospholipid Ab 4 ml blood/red-top tube\n4.  Protein C, Protein S, and Antithrombin III (AT III) levels in the neonate should usually be **delayed 3-6 mos** since normal physiologic levels of these proteins are decreased in neonates, and may overlap abnormal values. In addition, these factors are consumed during active thrombosis, decreasing levels further. Parental testing may be considered before that time.\n    a. **Homozygous Protein C and S deficiencies** are clinically severe, usually presenting with purpura fulminans. If this diagnosis is considered likely, testing in the neonate, as well as the parents, should be performed.\n    b. **Homozygous AT III deficiency** is exceedingly rare since it is usually embryonic lethal.\n\n<a id='e04020d1-6d5f-463c-9156-e8556f6109f5'></a>\n\nC. Therapeutic Options\n\n1. A Pediatric Hematology consult is strongly recommended when anticoagulation or thrombolytic therapy is being contemplated.\n\n2. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) has been used increasingly as the treatment of choice for antithrombotic therapy. Potential advantages over heparin therapy include more predictable pharmacokinetics (usually resulting in a decreased need for invasive monitoring), subcutaneous administration, and probably reduced risks with longer-term therapy. Note that decreased levels of AT III (as can be seen in ill neonates, or infants with inherited or acquired AT III deficiencies) can impair the anticoagulant properties of heparin. If LMWH (enoxaparin) is indicated, the following are published guidelines for dosing and therapeutic monitoring.\n\n<a id='339b2835-acec-4591-853b-cb4b074acaa0'></a>\n\nThis document is intended for use by staff of Stanford Hospitals and Clinics and/or Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.
