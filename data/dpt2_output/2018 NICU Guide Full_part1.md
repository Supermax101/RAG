## Developmental Care in the NICU

<a id='30d20405-03c9-4a65-90ed-9be19380e7e1'></a>

Melissa Scala, M.D.

I. **Definition and Background for Developmental Care**

Individualized family-centered developmental care is a framework for providing care that enhances the neurodevelopment of the infant through interventions that support both the infant and family unit. This approach impacts care starting with prenatal counseling, continuing through the NICU stay and into to postdischarge follow up care and requires the collaboration of multiple health care providers and families. It extends far beyond the care provided by the developmental care team, although the team may offer important guidance to parents and staff regarding best care practices. Important factors of developmental care include the physical environment of the NICU, light and sound levels, handling and positioning, care patterns, interactions with healthcare workers and, most importantly, family interactions. Understanding the principles of developmental care can guide NICU design, interactions between caregivers and infants, and teaching and discussions with families.

<a id='ab9e1103-725a-4e70-8b91-367ec2e808a4'></a>

The NICU is a much different environment from the womb, which is a warm and dark place free from high pitched sound and painful stimuli. Preterm infants are at a particularly vulnerable period of brain development when overproduction and apoptosis of neurons and pruning synapses craft the more permanent tracts in the brain for future function. Environmental influences, multiple painful procedures and stress may have short and long term impacts on their developing brains. Good developmental care aims to minimize the trauma imposed by the stress, pain and discomfort associated with NICU care and to create a healing environment in which normal infant brain development and normal family interactions are fostered.

<a id='24dff186-3382-4cac-80c6-eceed56d49a1'></a>

This is an evolving field and much remains to be learned regarding best evidence based practice. Many evidence supported interventions face barriers to implementation and other, standard practices are still not well tested by research or lack basis in current evidence.

<a id='e9b6acad-a095-4996-90fe-f9561da172ec'></a>

II. The Physical Environment

A. NICU Design

The physical design of the NICU is an important part of developmental care as it affects levels and type of sound exposure and rates of parent visitation and involvement. Improved outcomes have been seen in single patient rooms (SPR). These include lower stress and better weight gain and are mediated by improved developmental support and maternal involvement. However, some parents have reported higher degrees of stress and depression in SPR. Research is ongoing regarding best room design to support infants and families, but current evidence supports the important overall goals of improving family-infant interaction in a calm environment and the provision of developmental care as described below.

B. Light

Recommended light levels in the NICU are 10-600 lux but in most NICUs, levels are much higher and in the range of 400-1000 lux. Concern exists that constant light impedes development of circadian rhythms which will alter sleep-wake patterns, increase stress and create abnormal cortisol patterns. Reduced light stabilizes HR, RR, BP and motor activity and improves growth. Cycled light improves feeding, better weight gain, stabilizes RR and enhances motor coordination vs continuous light or near darkness. Practically, we cover incubators in the NICU to reduce light and noise.

C. Sound

Most sound exposure in the NICU comes from alarms, background staff conversation and other noise such as closing garbage cans or ringing phones. The sound environment of the NICU differs significantly from that of the womb and is a source of stress for the preterm infant. Recommended decibel levels for the NICU are hourly means of less than 55 dB and 1 second exposure of 70 dB. Unfortunately, most NICUs exceed these recommendations. Effects of excessive noise exposure include cardiorespiratory instability, hearing loss, sleep disruption and impact long term neurodevelopmental outcomes. Efforts should be made to reduce background noise exposure by keeping voices low and limiting unnecessary conversations around infants. To the extent possible, reduction of noise exposure from alarms and other environmental noise is preferred. On the other hand, low volume voice exposure directed at the infant, particularly from parents, should be offered routinely as language exposure is a normative womb experience and necessary for preterm brain development. (see III.B Voice Exposure)

III. Therapeutic Interventions

These therapies may be provided by health care workers but are preferably delivered by trained parents, as interventions may improve parent-infant bonding and lower parental stress and depression. Not all interventions are appropriate for all infants. Careful attention should be paid to infant gestational age, clinical condition and degree of neurologic maturity in order to individualize infant developmental care plans. Developmental team members, in collaboration with the healthcare team and families, can guide appropriate care.

A. Touch

Most infants, even the most ill, can and should be cared for using positive touch. Use of "hand-hugs" or gentle containment where hands are placed stably on the infant 's head and abdomen, mimic womb conditions and can calm preterm infants. As infants mature and stabilize more intense touch can be offered. Positive touch can begin as gentle stroking and progress up through massage and may improve weight gain and improve physiologic stability.

B. Voice Exposure

Preterm infants are at increased risk for cognitive and language difficulties. Development of language processing centers and pathways begin in utero and infants as young as 25 weeks can perceive and respond to sounds. The altered sound exposure that preterm infants receive can impact brain development and future neuro-developmental outcomes. Studies looking at infant exposure of maternal noise (i.e. recorded parental voice with or without heartbeat) have shown improved cardiorespiratory stability, increased weight gain and increased feed tolerance. Exposure to maternal voice improves cardiorespiratory stability and language development. Caregivers should talk softly to infants during exams and care times and parents should be encouraged to regularly expose their infants to voice via talking, reading or singing at safe decibel levels.

C. Music Therapy

Decibel appropriate, soothing music played for preterm infants increases O2 saturations, stabilizes HR, increases time sleeping in infants, calms agitated infants, reduces length of stay, and improves sucking/feeding ability. Devices are available in the unit to play quiet lullabies.

D. Kangaroo Care or Skin to Skin Care

Holding an infant against a parent's bare chest can have both short and long term positive impacts on

infants and parents. Effects include lower mortality, lower risk of sepsis, increased breast feeding, improvement in thermoregulation, weight gain and oxygenation. Kangaroo care improves mother-infant interaction and maternal confidence and reduces worry and depression. Parents should be encouraged to hold their infants daily for a minimum of 1 hour but may continue for longer periods if infant condition and temperature are stable.

E. Infant Massage

Preterm infants receiving moderate pressure massage gain weight faster and have shorter lengths of stay. Similar results are seen with trained parent vs medical provider delivery. Infant massage improves mother- infant interaction, decreases depression and increases mother's sense of competence. Very preterm infants may not tolerate this degree of stimulation but older preterm and stable term infants show significant benefits.

F. Therapeutic Positioning

Infants should be evaluated with each care interaction for age-appropriate postural alignment which includes at minimum: mid-line orientation, gentle flexion, and containment of the extremities. Therapeutic positioning facilitates infant comfort, physiologic stability, and optimal neuromotor and neurosensory development. It also has the potential to prevent postural and anatomic deformities, such as torticollis and plagiocephaly. In order to meet positioning goals, the NICU utilizes a variety of support devices (e.g. blanket rolls, gel pillows, etc) to provide comfort and containment of extremities in a gently flexed position; similiar to the fetus' in-utero position.

IV. **Managing Pain and Stress in the Newborn**

A. Stress

Signs of infant stress are subtle and are often misinterpreted as normal behavior. Stress signals can include splayed fingers, startling, hiccups, gagging, vocalizations, sucking, hands to face, and to lesser extent facial grimacing. The more ill an infant, the less able he or she is to display stress or pain cues. Reduction of stress can be accomplished via careful attention to infant environment, slow-controlled handling during cares and procedures, and appropriate delivery of previously noted developmental care interventions. Careful positioning of infants while sleeping and during painful procedures may reduce signs of infant stress and improve neurodevelopmental outcomes.

B. Pain

V. **Developmental care** overlaps with and is central to family centered care. Developmental care programs involving parents in the NICU have proven to improve mother-infant interactions after discharge. See family centered care section.

I. **Philosophy**

We recognize that parents and families are often in a state of emotional crisis when their newborn is hospitalized and they are separated from their child. We believe that parents and families, in collaboration with the Neonatology Team, other specialists, and hospital personnel, are key in facilitating wholesome and expeditious care. Following a Family Centered Care approach and recognizing our present space limitations, we have developed the following guidelines for parents, families, and their guests when in the Intensive Care Nurseries.

<a id='c18398e1-4119-4215-a97d-f25642780ee7'></a>

II. **Family Involvement Guidelines**

A. Parents are encouraged to be at their baby's bedside however long and whenever best suits their emotional and physical needs. Such time together may facilitate bonding, parental preparedness, as well as increase maternal milk supply. Skin-to-skin contact ("kangaroo care") has been shown to be associated with improvement in neurodevelopmental outcomes and thus should be promoted accordingly. There are a few special considerations when parents visit:

   1. When there is a procedure or emergency in the room happening to another patient, medical personnel may elect to restrict access to the room. For some minor procedures, (e.g. lumbar puncture, line placement, circumcisions) parents may choose to stay, and may do so with the understanding and agreement by the person doing the procedure. It may be appropriate and even preferable to allow parents to be present during resuscitative efforts on their child.

   2. During nurses' changes of shift (from 7-7:30 am and 7-7:30 p.m., and 11-11:30 pm), parents may be asked to leave the NICU rooms in order to allow for critical hand-offs between, and care by, the bedside nurses.

   3. During doctors' rounds, parents are allowed to remain at their baby's bedside and should be included in the discussions regarding their baby. Parents should be informed of this option upon admission of their baby to the NICU. If parents have excessive questions or unusual informational needs, arrangements should be made to meet with them after rounds.

B. Parents are given a plastic wrist ID band from the NICU front desk. They may be asked to show photo identification. The parent's wristband received at labor and delivery must match that of the baby. All family members and visitors receive a "visitor badge" sticker at the desk opposite the main entrance on the first floor of LPCH.

C. Parents may bring one guest at a time into the Nursery during visiting hours (8 am to 9 pm). This is to permit medical professionals necessary access to the bedside at all times, control noise levels, and maintain a healthy environment for the babies.

   1. There is a limit of 2 persons at the bedside. Parents may list up to 4 individuals who may visit when they cannot be there.

   2. No visitors, except immediate family members, may be admitted into the NICU after 9 pm for safety reasons.

   3. Siblings of any age can visit in the NICU, ICN, and the Maternity floors during visiting hours. Non-sibling children must be 16 yrs of age or older to visit.

4. Visitors under the age 18 may not remain in the hospital after 9 pm unless they are the parents; this includes infant siblings of the patient who are still breastfeeding.

D. Sleeping arrangements can be made with the social worker. Fire codes prohibit sleeping in alcoves, corridors or open public areas.

E. Parents, siblings, and guests must not have been exposed to chicken pox or measles, have had a cold in the last week, or a fever within the last 24 hrs. Hand washing is required prior to touching the baby. For convenience, sinks are located at the entrance of the nurseries.

F. Additional restrictions may be necessary during Influenza and RSV season.

G. Medical information will only be given out to the parents. The parents may, if they choose to, select who will be with them when this medical information is provided. The medical staff prefers not to make exceptions to this guideline; however, consideration will be given in special situations.

<a id='833ee36b-5acf-4d14-9c09-fadc7450dcdd'></a>

### III. Special Circumstances

A. Adoption: We respect the biological mother's wishes at all times and encourage her presence. The adoptive family's presence is encouraged as authorized by the birth mother.

B. Surrogacy: All parties involved are welcome to enter the NICU. Please consult with the Social Worker to address the specific needs of the family.

<a id='ca7f4415-7229-4068-8648-aa9aa08c0754'></a>

IV. **General Information**

A. Hand washing is vigorously enforced, as it is as very important and successful in controlling the spread of infection. Parents are allowed to remind medical and hospital staff of the need for proper hand hygiene. If a person (parent or staff member) is ill with a contagious disease, they may not enter the Nursery. For specific isolation policies, please contact Infection Control. [Also see NICU Guide Section II.E. "Hand Hygeine Policy".]

B. There are 2 Parent Rooms and 2 sleep sofas in the Family Lounge where parents can stay overnight. These can be reserved through the Social Worker or Resource Nurse. The rooms may be used exclusively by the assigned family from 8:30 pm to 8:30 am. Priority is given based on acuity of baby's illness, a family's distance from the hospital, discharge education requirements, and other parental needs. The Social Worker and Housing Office can facilitate alternative lodging such as the Ronald McDonald House, guest home or nearby hotel (at a reduced or complimentary rate).

C. Parent Rooms are open for general use on a rotating basis between 8:30 am and 8:30 pm. These rooms are for pumping, brief resting/relaxing, and case conferences.

D. Parents are encouraged to bring family pictures to place at the bedside of their babies. Stuffed animals are welcome; they must be small and limited in number.

E. We request that families and guests in the nursery patient rooms stay at their baby's bedside in order to respect the privacy of other families.

F. Flowers, plants, balloons, and electrical appliances are not allowed on the unit. No food or drinks are allowed in patient care areas, specifically around any baby's bedside. Families are encouraged to take advantage of the Parent Lounge for this purpose. A microwave, refrigerator, and sink are available.

<a id='43bd8958-9149-4898-90fc-b24515a8ba25'></a>

G. Medical procedures often require that babies are quiet, relaxed, and rested. For this reason, families are asked to consult with the Bedside Nurse upon arrival to obtain information on their child's status and readiness for handling.

H. Parents are asked not to bring clothes in for the baby until the infant's condition is stable.

I. Cultural rituals and spiritual or religious ceremonies will be accommodated to the extent that this is possible. Contact the Social Worker, Resource Nurse or Nursing Management to make arrangements.

J. Before moving a patient within the NICU, or before transferring a patient to another unit within LPCH (including the ICN), to the Operating Room, or to another hospital, there should be timely notification of the parents. Leaving a message on a phone number provided by the parents to relay this information (limiting clinical data and Protected Health Information) is not a violation of HIPAA (per LPCH/Stanford Risk Management).

II. **Programs**

A. **Inpatient Johnson Center Developmental Program**

1.  The Developmental Care Team is comprised of infant development specialists including an educator, a psychologist, nurse practitioners, and physical and occupational therapists. The team's purpose is to encourage relationship-based individualized developmental care to support the developing nervous system of high-risk infants, make developmental recommendations for transition to home, and to promote access to community early intervention resources.

2.  Each baby referred for Developmental Care Team services will have a primary team member working with the family and the baby. The "primary" takes responsibility for documentation of the Developmental Assessment that will be noted in the Ancillary Notes Section of the Electronic Medical Record. These Developmental Assessment findings and recommendations should be included in the Medical Discharge Summary to facilitate access to early intervention services and consistency in care.

3.  Criteria for Referral to the Developmental Care Team:
    a. Birth weight <1500 gm
    b. Prolonged hospital course
    c. Suspected CNS abnormalities
    d. Syndromes associated with developmental compromise

c. HRIF Medical Director

CCS supports 3 visits up to age 3 years and scheduled for 4-8 months, 12-16 months, and 18-36 months (adjusted or chronological age). Additional visits before age 3 years for children as needed. At LPCH written information on the follow-up program is generally provided to the parents while the infant is hospitalized. If a child is discharged prior to obtaining information about the follow-up program, information will be mailed to the family. Children with ongoing unmet needs are able to access the Preemie Graduate Services program after age 3 yrs (see section II.B.9).

6. Written information on the follow-up program is generally provided to the parents while the infant is hospitalized. If an infant/child is discharged prior to obtaining information about the follow-up program, information will be mailed to the family

7. HRIF visit schedule:

a. 1st visit between 4-8 months corrected age
b. 2nd visit between 12-16 months corrected age

8. Enrollment Process in High Risk Infant Follow-Up

<a id='8af601ed-9dd5-411a-8ea9-abf666baeeff'></a>

a. It is the responsibility of the discharging NICU to register the baby with CCS CPQCC for High Risk Infant Follow-up and obtain an appointment. An appointment can be obtained by securely emailing or faxing a completed HRIF Intake form and a copy of the history and physical to: dbpoffice@stanfodchildrens.org or fax 650-724-6500.

i. Babies discharged from the LPCH intensive care nurseries will be registered by the CCS HRIF Coordinator. Appointments will be made prior to discharge (as long as primary care provider is listed in the EMR). A program brochure and letter about the appointment are provided to the family by either the Developmental Specialist or the Social Worker working with the family.
ii. Appointment dates and times can also be viewed in electronic medical record.

b. When a baby is transported back to a CCS approved Community NICU and discharged to home, the discharging NICU is responsible for referring for HRIF. After the baby is discharged to home, a copy of the NICU DC Summary needs to be securely emailed to the LPCH HRIF program at dbpoffice@stanfordchildrens.org. The discharging NICU must register the infant in the CCS CPQCC database and electronically transfer the file to LPCH HRIF.

c. The discharging NICU/Hospital must submit a SAR (Service Authorization Request) to the local CCS Office for HRIF services to be obtained through LPCH.

d. Non-CCS referrals (see II.B.4 above) are sent by secure email or fax to the Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics' Office at: dbpoffice@stanfordchildrens.org or fax 650-724-6500.

These are general guidelines for inpatient prenatal consults at LPCH. Each consult will need to be tailored to the circumstances of the mother and fetus, as well as proximity to the time of delivery.

<a id='675d3165-e106-4616-9ee7-39923faa291f'></a>

I. **Who Needs Prenatal Counseling?**

A. Anyone whose infant is likely to need specialized newborn care.

B. Mothers who are delivering or are at high risk of delivering prematurely need an inpatient prenatal consult.

C. Mothers who are carrying fetuses with known surgical or other high risk conditions will likely have had an outpatient prenatal consult through the Fetal and Pregnancy Health Program (letter located in mother's chart), but may want additional counseling when they arrive for delivery.

D. Consults may be requested by the Maternal-Fetal Medicine physicians or obstetricians. Requests for inpatient consults should come directly from the OB service to the neonatology fellow, *not* via the bedside OB RN, OB charge RN, NICU team leader, or NICU charge RN.

<a id='bdc58906-8884-4d0c-aadc-7a9122b020c6'></a>

## II. Who Does Prenatal Counseling?

A. Fellow: Most in-patient prenatal consults are done by the Neonatalogy Fellow. It is best to do these consults during the day so that the mother meets the fellow who is on service. Urgent consults do arise and may need to be done on nights and weekends. In the case of complex consults (e.g., extreme prematurity <25 wks EGA, severe genetic anomalies) an effort should be made to discuss the consult with the NICU attending _before_ speaking to the parents. When consults involve discussions regarding the limits of viability (22 0/7 to 25 6/7 weeks EGA), the MFM team should also be included before the consult is done.

B. Hospitalist: For infants who are being delivered at >33 wks EGA and are likely to go the ICN instead of the NICU, the hospitalist may be asked to do the consult.

C. Housestaff: Although housestaff do not do consults, they may accompany the fellow or hospitalist to learn about this aspect of neonatology.

D. Attending: Outpatient prenatal consults are done through the Fetal and Pregnancy Health Program. A copy of the outpatient consult letter will be in the mother's medical record and a hard copy may also be found at the charge nurse's desk.

<a id='f03da4e6-68cc-4f2a-b4e8-fb8ef3b26f5f'></a>

III. **What Do I Need to Know Before the Consult?**

A. The most important thing to know before doing a prenatal consult is whether a consult has already been done! It confuses parents and sends a message of disorganization if parents are approached multiple times.

B. **Check the chart**: There should be a note in the mother's chart in EPIC, under the "Consults" tab, if a consult was done.

C. **Ask the patient**: Check with the patient to determine if they have spoken with a neonatologist, neonatology fellow, or hospitalist. There are circumstances in which a second consult is requested and

16 Part I-B: Delivery and Admission
should be done (e.g., a consult was done at 24 wks EGA, but the patient is now about to deliver at 32 wks EGA). If parents request additional information, have new questions, or would like a new family member to be updated, a second consult can be performed provided there are no other consults that take precedence.

D. Once you have determined that a consult is needed, collect information about the patient's pregnancy:

1.  **Gender, dates, estimated fetal weight and steroids**: For premature deliveries, the most important information includes how certain the dates are, whether steroids have been given, and whether the steroid course is complete. This information can then be used to assess risk of death and disability based on the current division consensus guidelines.
2.  **Patient knowledge**: It is useful to find out what the mother has been told and what her reaction has been, although you'll ask her directly as you start the consult. It is helpful to know if a patient has other children or any prior experience with the NICU.
3.  **Language**: If the mother is not a native English speaker, remember to request a translator and not to use a family member.

<a id='2f76aaae-7021-4a96-b625-404c5cb5c881'></a>

IV. **How Should I Start the Conversation?**

A. Everyone has their own style, but there are a few useful initial questions to ask.

1. Who would the mother like included in the conversation? Is their partner available? If time allows, it is better to speak with both parents together so that they hear the same message.
2. What have the parents already been told and what is their understanding of the situation?
3. Ask the parents if they have named the baby. This may help personalize what is otherwise a difficult conversation.
4. Encourage them to ask questions. Reassurance that we understand that they are stressed and may not remember what is said helps many parents to feel comfortable asking questions during the consult and again when the infant is in the NICU.

<a id='73d18475-bdec-46f7-8cf5-15b9a944df2e'></a>

V. **What are the Major Issues to Discuss?**

A. **Team structure:** We work as a team in both the DR and the NICU, and explaining this can help to avoid confusion and conflicts later. The workings of a teaching hospital can be quite confusing to parents. Start by explaining who will be at the delivery (physician or NNP, RN, and possibly RT). Also explain the structure in the NICU (attending, resident, NNP, hospitalist, RN, RT). Encourage them to ask team members in the NICU who they are and what their role is if they lose track. Many parents are also nervous about the "teaching" aspects of care. This is a good time to reassure them that we always provide supervision and will not place their child in an unsafe situation. You can also emphasize the benefits of a teaching hospital in terms of expertise and availability of specialists.

B. **Respiratory support:** Briefly describe the possible types of respiratory support that we provide, from blow-by oxygen to intubation, both in the DR and in the NICU. Discuss surfactant, if appropriate.

C. **Cardiac support:** Discuss the interventions that may be necessary in the DR or NICU, such as medications, IV fluids, and, if appropriate, chest compressions. This is a good time to describe umbilical

Prenatal Counseling 17
lines since many of our patients will need them. It is also a good time to mention the potential use of blood products (a Gann Act still needs to be done at NICU admission).

<a id='1feca409-6df9-47df-96c4-1ef3b295b187'></a>

D. **Metabolic support**: Almost every mother asks how her infant will be fed. If the mother plans to provide breast milk, assure her that we provide many types of support for lactation, encourage her to begin pumping as soon as she is able after delivery, and that this is a major contribution she can make to her infant's care. It is important to mention the use of donor milk until her supply is adequate. NG tubes and TPN should be mentioned. The rationale behind slow advancement of feeds and the risk for NEC should also be mentioned.

<a id='f77d7cdd-40bf-437e-a375-898b88e23c33'></a>

E. **Infection**: Many babies admitted to the NICU will undergo a septic work up, which will include immediate administration of antibiotics, but may also include an LP, depending on gestational age and circumstances surrounding birth. Explaining the necessity of checking for infection and the risks of untreated or partially treated infections may avoid issues regarding the LP later.

<a id='76d6b922-5fbc-4b09-b54d-73acf788e474'></a>

F. **Neurologic support**: It is important to reassure parents that we treat pain and agitation in newborns with medication or developmentally appropriate methods (e.g., swaddling, Sweet-Ease). It is also important to mention that a screening HUS will be performed, if appropriate, to evaluate for IVH.

<a id='fa941713-3995-4920-b085-3f0e1ebcc339'></a>

G. Other common concerns: Parents find the idea of separation from their infant very stressful. Explain that the mother's partner can come to the NICU with the newborn after delivery. Assure them that we will encourage contact as soon as possible, and that even if for medical reasons they cannot initially hold the infant, they will be able to touch and speak to the newborn. Parents also ask how long the infant will be in the hospital. Give a reasonable estimate (around the due date for premature infants, often many weeks for surgical issues), but note the unpredictability for any individual newborn.

<a id='cb1752a3-2662-4ae4-8ece-4f5fb9c8b54f'></a>

H. **Reassure mom:** Most importantly, please remember to let the mother know that what is happening is not her fault! Many mothers feel very guilty about premature delivery or genetic anomalies. Families may blame a mother for pregnancy complications—having a physician state very early and clearly that the mother is not to blame can help both the mother and family.

<a id='c5f7ed7d-580f-40a1-885d-d78a34e8a3d6'></a>

VI. **Specific Circumstances for Discussion**

A. **Premature birth:** Most inpatient consults will be requested for impending premature delivery. Each conversation will need to be tailored for the specific gestational age, but the basic short and long term complications of prematurity should be discussed: RDS and CLD; systemic infection; NEC; PDA; IVH and PVL; ROP; and finally, the long term risks for developmental delay, cerebral palsy, blindness, and deafness. It is important for the parent to have at least heard a mention of potential complications from the outset, although you should obviously change the tenor of your conversation depending on the gestational age of the fetus.

B. **Decisions regarding viability and resuscitation:** This is likely to be the most difficult part of any consult, but it needs to be discussed for both extremely premature infants and for infants with documented lethal anomalies (e.g., Trisomy 13 or 18). It is important to let parents know that resuscitation at delivery is not a "point of no return". The DR is not necessarily the best place to make the decision regarding comfort care measures. DR resuscitation can provide time in the NICU for determining a more accurate prognosis and allowing for joint physician and parental decisions. It is impossible to predict what may happen when the infant is delivered, but having a basic plan that has been developed and discussed with the parents, in terms of the level of resuscitation, is crucial. The prenatal consult is the time to lay the groundwork with the parents for creating a plan. Remember to discuss the plan with the attending and communicate it to other members of the team.

C. **Extreme prematurity:** The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians

18 Part I-B: Delivery and Admission
and Gynecologists stress adequate counseling regarding outcomes as a critical aspect of peri-viable obstetrical management, which is now defined as 22 0/7 to 25 6/7 wk EGA. At LPCH, there is no absolute policy regarding resuscitation of infants delivered at the limits of viability; however, division consensus guidelines have been created to help standardize information given to our families, so please refer to them. The AAP routinely recommends resuscitation at 25 weeks, while the practice at LPCH has typically been not to initiate resuscitation at <23 wks. There is an on-going dialogue between the attendings in both Neonatology and Maternal-Fetal Medicine regarding available data and the optimal approach. Each case is handled individually and should be discussed with the attending prior to counseling, particularly if the gestational age of the fetus is <25 wks. Counseling of parents of peri-viable infants may require several discussions, if time allows. It should be explained that when an infant is extremely premature, there is no initial way of knowing whether this infant is likely to be one of those who survives and, if he/she does, whether he/she will have long-term disabilities, although the risk is certainly higher with earlier gestations. What constitutes such "extreme prematurity" that non-intervention is an acceptable option is a grey zone. Between 23-25 wks EGA, comfort care only is a reasonable choice, but the plan must be discussed with the OB and Neonatology attendings. More commonly, parents request aggressive resuscitation for extremely premature infants. You will need to emphasize the likelihood that the infant may not survive despite aggressive interventions and the serious challenges that lie ahead for this infant and their family if the infant does survive, including the possibility of neurological impairment (see statistics below). While these statistics can be used for counseling, it is important to remind parents that their child is an individual; what matters for their family is what happens to that individual. It is important to discuss that some families choose comfort care and some choose aggressive resuscitation; reassure them that they will be supported no matter what decision they make.

<a id='68c0f811-3399-4883-9cfc-a945dd829d9c'></a>

D. **Multiples**: Most parents of multiples have had counseling from their OB regarding the risks of twin or higher order pregnancies. Discuss that separate teams will care for each infant in the DR, but will place both infants on the same team in the NICU. Specific issues may need to be discussed, such as the increased risks to the recipient twin in cases of twin-twin transfusion or to the smaller infant if there is a significant weight discrepancy.

E. **Hydrops**: This condition requires special counseling of parents because of the increased possibility that the DR resuscitation will require additional procedures, such as thoracentesis and/or paracentesis.

<a id='c79d6424-33e9-418b-b7c5-61662ba958a7'></a>

VII. **What Else Do Parents Need to Know?**

Every consult should also discuss the following:

A. Research: LPCH is a university hospital and a member of the NICHD Research Network and Pediatrics Trials Network. Parents may be approached about several research studies during the course of their stay. It is helpful to emphasize the importance of the studies, but also to reassure the parents that we will take excellent and unbiased care of their infant whether or not they participate in research.
B. LPCH has several nurseries: Let parents know that their infant may start off in the NICU, but when ready may be transferred to another unit (e.g., ICN 1 or 2, CVICU, Sequoia, other Central Coast nurseries). Transfers occur for a variety of reasons such as the need for a lower level of care, cardiac surgery management, or moving the infant closer to home, and always include discussion with the parents.

<a id='87e6f204-891f-44a0-bf86-d9f85e635a7e'></a>

VIII. **What Resources Can We Offer to Parents Beyond the Consult?**

There are many resources that parents will learn about, but a few are worth mentioning prior to delivery:

A. Tour of the NICU: The mother may not to be able to see the NICU, but her partner can be shown the

Prenatal Counseling
NICU by the NICU charge RN. That way they know where the unit is located, what an incubator looks like, and possibly how big their infant might be. If a parent is interested, tell the NICU charge RN when you return to the unit and she can arrange to bring the parent over at an appropriate time.

<a id='c01dd191-1f68-4c14-be48-234d1c225318'></a>

B. Lactation services: LPCH has a dedicated team of doctors and nurses who will help the mother produce breast milk and learn to breastfeed. It is helpful to point out this is an important contribution that a mother can make, that there are many people to help her, and the importance of breast milk for infants.

C. Religious Services/Social Work Services/Parent Support Groups: There are many people to help the family and parents should know that they can request support at any time from these groups.

<a id='cf962e52-35fc-454a-8e60-92257d757e94'></a>

IX. **What Needs to Be Done After the Consult?**

<a id='6b5f2d3c-f821-46da-a7f4-cf3fe743ee72'></a>

Please remember to:

A. **Document the consult**: Place a note in the mother's EPIC chart, letting both the OB and the NICU team know that a consult was done.

1. Create a consult note, then type "prenatal consult note IP" into the SmartText box. This will generate a template with the mother's data already auto-populated into the appropriate fields. There will be blanks for filling in the EGA and EFW of the fetus.
2. Type in the dot phrase appropriate for the EGA of the fetus to generate the details of your discussion with the mother:
   a. .prenatal24wk
   b. .prenatal26wk
   c. .prenatal28wk
   d. .prenatal30wk
   e. .prenatal32wk

B. **Tell the Antepartum or L&D Nurse**: This may help prevent redundant consult requests.

C. **Inform the NICU team**: Let the admitting NICU attending know about the consult. In the case of extreme prematurity or unusual circumstance, decisions about delivery room resuscitation must be discussed with the attending, both before and after the consult. If a specific plan is in place, the NICU team leader and the on-call fellow must also be informed.

D. **Speak with the OB team**: Particularly in the case of extreme prematurity (i.e., <25 wks EGA), a particular plan has likely been made about resuscitation and the OB needs to know, since they may adjust their management (e.g. tocolysis, steroids, fetal monitoring, cesarean delivery) if full resuscitation will be attempted.

## II. Delivery Room Preparation and Resuscitation

### A. Delivery Room Team:

Our "Standard" Delivery Room team is comprised of at least one MD/NNP and at least one RN. Our "Standard" Delivery Room team will attend most of the "high-risk" deliveries (as noted above) for which a Pediatric team is called. However, there may be certain situations where a "Complex" Delivery Room team will be called instead. This includes preterm infants <32 weeks, infants with complex congenital anomalies, situations where there is a Category 3 fetal heart tracing, or for deliveries where extensive resuscitation may be required, including STAT calls to the delivery room. Our "Complex" Delivery Room team is comprised of at least two MD/NNPs, at least two RNs and a Respiratory Therapist, as needed.

If, at any time, you are in the Delivery Room and realize that more support is needed, make sure to relay that request to the NICU and ask for a full "Complex" or backup Delivery Room team to be mobilized, and/or specify who else (e.g. Fellow, Attending Neonatologist) or what else (e.g. Tackle Box, Neo Code Cart, or other NICU supplies) is needed.

B. Introduction into the Delivery Room:
When entering the Delivery Room, always make sure to introduce yourself. When going to a delivery in the labor rooms, a cover gown can prevent unnecessary soilage. For entry to the C-section suites, one is required to wear scrubs, a hat and mask. Once you have introduced yourself, inquire about the gestational age of the infant (term or preterm), the number of infants being delivered, the presence of meconium, and any other pertinent information. In the surgical suites used for C-sections, you will find a sterile gown, gloves, and blanket waiting on a table next to the radiant warmer. If you will be "catching" the infant, these need to be donned in a timely manner. Attending deliveries in the labor rooms and surgical suites requires knowledge of the location of the resuscitation tray. It is usually on the silver table next to the radiant warmer in the surgical suites or in the bottom drawer underneath the infant resuscitation bed in the labor rooms.

C. Preparing your equipment
1. Make sure the radiant warmer is on, the heat is turned up to maximum, and warm blankets are available.
2. Check the suction set-up.
3. Check the oxygen source and make sure there is adequate flow to the anesthesia bag or T-piece (8-10 lpm).
4. To prepare the T-piece, adjust the gas supply to desired flow rate between 8-10 lpm. Check maximum pressure by occluding the PEEP cap and turning PIP control fully clockwise (the maximum pressure should be 30 cm H2O). Set the PIP by occluding the PEEP cap and simultaneously turning the PIP control knob counter-clockwise until the desired PIP is set (start at 20 cm H2O). Set the PEEP by adjusting the knob on the PEEP cap to the desired PEEP level (start at 5 cm H2O).
5. Check to ensure you have the proper size mask. Check the laryngoscope light and ascertain that proper size blades (#0 for term infants and #0 or #00 for preemies) are available. If other size blades (#1) are desired, these can be found in the Neo Code Cart.
6. Set out the correct size endotracheal tube (i.e., 3.5 for term or weight >2 kg, 3.0 for preemies >1 kg, 2.5 for preemies <1 kg, 2.0 for preemies <500 gm) and an end-tidal CO2 detector (pedicap) if available.
7. If you anticipate that the infant will need resuscitation, PPV, or oxygen supplementation, set out the pulse oximetry probe. Check to ensure you have the proper size probe.
8. If attending the delivery of an infant <35 weeks or IUGR, take a warming mattress with you. If you are attending the delivery of an infant <32 weeks, take a NeoWrap and thermal cap with you. Prior to the delivery, prepare the warming mattress and place it on the radiant warmer. Next, lay a blanket out on top of the warming mattress and then the NeoWrap flat on top of that.
9. If you anticipate that the infant will be admitted to the NICU, check to see if a battery pack is present on the bottom of the radiant warmer and is charged. If one is not present, ask the L&D nurse/tech to see if there is time to bring a radiant warmer with a battery pack to the room.
10. For potential codes, set up an umbilical vein catheter, flush solution, epinephrine, and have the Neonatal Resuscitation Cart readily accessible. There should be Neonatal Resuscitation Carts available in the main L&D hallway as well as in the C-section suite area. Try to familiarize yourself with

<a id='3e66edba-95bc-4fa8-81f9-c6435b232867'></a>

11. At the time of delivery, look for nuchal cord, amount of maternal bleeding, degree of placental transfusion, and meconium. Note type of delivery (e.g., NSVD, vacuum-assist, forceps, C-section).

<a id='39c64019-146a-4bc2-877c-c5602ee97bf0'></a>

D. Once the infant is born

1. Start the Apgar timer.
2. Follow Delayed Cord Clamping Procedure (see Nursery Guide Section on Delayed Cord Clamping).
3. Place the infant on the radiant warmer with the head towards the end of the bed. If the infant is <32 weeks, immediately place directly in the center of the NeoWrap. Fold the NeoWrap over the infant, covering the entire body except for the infant's head. It is not necessary to dry the infant prior to using the NeoWrap.
4. It is not necessary to suction all infants, only those who demonstrate respiratory distress or if there is evidence of obstruction.
5. If the infant has meconium prior to or at delivery, see section V. A on "Meconium Staining".
6. Dry the infant (unless NeoWrap used), especially the head and face, which represent 20% of body surface area. Remove wet blankets as able. Cover the head with a warm cap. (Use the special thermal cap if infant <32 weeks.)
7. If resuscitation is anticipated, PPV is required, supplemental oxygen is administered, or persistent cyanosis is present, place the pulse oximetry probe on the infant as soon as possible. The probe should be attached to the infant before connecting the probe to the monitor. Make sure to place the probe on the right hand or wrist in order to obtain a pre-ductal O2 saturation level. When placing the probe, make sure to line up the emitter and detector so that they are directly opposite each other.
8. If the infant has a heart rate ≤100 and/or has little or no respiratory effort after warming, drying, and stimulation, initiate positive pressure ventilation (PPV). In most cases, proper PPV via mask and T-piece/bag is just as effective as being intubated and will allow you time to stabilize the infant before intubating.
9. The T-piece can be used to give blow-by oxygen, CPAP, and mask or endotracheal tube ventilation. An anesthesia bag can be used if necessary. All delivery room beds will be set up with the T-piece.
10. For infants born at term, you may use supplemental oxygen (start at 21%, the concentration can be adjusted between room air and 100% with the oxygen blender) if the infant is cyanotic or when positive-pressure ventilation is required.
11. For preterm infants <35 weeks, use an oxygen blender and pulse oximeter during resuscitation. If positive-pressure ventilation is required, you may begin with oxygen concentration at 21% and then adjust the oxygen concentration (between room air and 100%) as needed to achieve the desired clinical response. If the infant's heart rate does not respond by increasing rapidly to >100, you may increase the oxygen concentration as necessary up to 100%. For preterm infants <32 weeks, consider CPAP as the preferred method to provide respiratory support unless otherwise indicated.
12. If endotracheal (ET) intubation is required for resuscitation (except in the case of suctioning meconium), use an end-tidal CO2 detector to confirm ET tube placement, if available.

24 Part I-B: Delivery and Admission

13. Chest compressions are indicated when the heart rate remains <60 beats/min after at least 30 seconds of effective ventilation. In most cases, a properly inserted ET tube may be required (prior to initiating chest compressions) in order to achieve effective ventilation.

14. If epinephrine is required during the resuscitation, use recommended dosing and concentration for the route available.
    a. IV: 0.1 to 0.3 mL/kg of the 1 mg in 10 mL concentration (previously labeled as 1:10,000 solution) drawn up in 1 mL syringe
    b. ET: 0.5 to 1 mL/kg of the 1 mg in 10 mL concentration (previously labeled as 1:10,000 solution) drawn up in 3 or 6 mL syringe
    c. Consider ET route ONLY while IV access is being obtained

15. Determine the Apgar scores as outlined in Section III.D below, "APGAR Scoring System". Check the heart rate by auscultation or by palpating the umbilical stump. Continue to check the Apgar scores every 5 min until the score is 7 or greater. Relay this information to the OB RN so that APGAR scores can be entered into the EMR.

16. If you arrive at the delivery room after the infant is greater than 1 min of age, the OB team is responsible for assigning the 1 min Apgar score.

<a id='609124c4-ab57-4b05-820c-cafc73f96b7a'></a>

### III. Other Resuscitation Information

A. Review your Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) booklet, and attend a Center for Advanced Pediatric and Perinatal Education (CAPE) simulation-based NRP class.

B. Clinical judgment:

1. When assessing the newborn, do not let the Apgar score dictate disposition or appropriate resuscitative management.
2. If you have doubt about a baby's stability, consider admitting the baby to the NICU or the ICN for further observation and management.

C. Always explain to the parents what you are doing and allow them to see their baby as soon as possible. Sometimes it is helpful to have the father or significant other accompany you back to the unit.

The Delivery Room
D. APGAR Scoring System: Provides a standard for describing the condition of infants at birth. Five objective signs are evaluated and each given a score of 0, 1, or 2. The sum of the 5 scores is the Apgar score. Apgar scores are assigned at 1 and 5 minutes and then every 5 minutes until it is ≥7.

Respiratory Management of the Preterm Infant

<a id='dc0b2bb2-21a7-47f4-83bd-d6574932da7f'></a>

Christine Johnson M.D., Katherine McCallie M.D., and Ronald Cohen M.D.

The arrival of an extremely preterm infant is a high-intensity event which, to be handled successfully, requires the coordination of multiple disciplines. Management in the first hour of a premature infant's life may have lifelong implications. We have borrowed the phrase, "the golden hour" from emergency/trauma medicine and use it in reference to the first hour of an infant's life. This term was changed to "the platinum hour" in 2015 given changes to the "golden hour" and a new era of respiratory management for the premature infant.

<a id='957c4d9a-8b4f-4c2f-969b-5ff9993d806a'></a>

I. The Platinum Hour
A. SUPPORT Trial: This RCT comparing intubation to CPAP in the DR for babies 24-27 weeks found:
1. Required intubation or postnatal corticosteroids for BPD less frequently.
2. Required fewer days of mechanical ventilation.
3. More likely to be alive and free from need for mechanical ventilation by day 7.

<a id='87d30afc-5ea5-4632-8090-807466eb293a'></a>

B. **COIN Trial**: This RCT also compared CPAP to intubation in DR for babies 25-28 weeks gestation found the following.

1. A trend towards lower BPD rates with the use of early NCPAP (by 5 minutes of life) that was not statistically significant.
2. Subgroup analysis (Germany) with follow up pulmonary function testing at 2 months of age found:
   a. Fewer days of mechanical ventilation.
   b. Fewer total respiratory support days.
   c. Better PFTs: lower RR, lower minute ventilation, better compliance, improved work of breathing.

<a id='a3910965-afc2-4251-9932-7ac3380390c1'></a>

C. **AAP Policy Statement** on "Respiratory Support in Preterm Infants at Birth" from the Committee of Fetus and Newborn:

1.  The recommendation was: "Using CPAP immediately after birth with subsequent selective surfactant administration may be considered as an alternative to routine intubation with prophylactic or early surfactant administration in preterm infants (Level of Evidence: 1, Strong Recommendation). If it is likely that respiratory support with a ventilator will be needed, early administration of surfactant followed by rapid extubation is preferable to prolonged ventilation (Level of Evidence: 1, Strong Recommendation)."

<a id='fae6eea4-26a3-4c66-9717-8e388380400e'></a>

D. Platinum Hour Delivery room management of Preterm infants ≤ 28 weeks.

1.  **Team composition**: The "Complex" DR team should be called for infants <28 weeks estimated gestational age and should consist of:
    a. Neonatal fellow
    b. NNP and/or NICU hospitalist

A pre-delivery briefing (with assignment of roles) should occur prior to delivery when possible. For infants **28 0/7 to 29 6/7 weeks GA**, a "Standard" delivery team will be called, but the Platinum Hour Algorithm should still be followed.

2. Temperature regulation: Careful attention should be paid to temperature management (pre-warmed, incubator, drying, changing towels, hat, warming mattress, and plastic wrap). Admission temperature has been shown to be inversely related to mortality in ELBW infants (28% increase in mortality for every 1°C below 37°C).

3. Respiratory care:

a. **ALL** infants ≤29 6/7 weeks GA should receive continuous mask CPAP in the delivery room using the T-piece resuscitator within 5 minutes of delivery.

b. Intubation should be reserved only for standard NRP indications (e.g. failure to respond to PPV with continuing cyanosis or bradycardia, or need for chest compressions or intratracheal medications). Delivery room intubation may also be performed for repetitive or persistent apnea requiring bag-mask ventilation or clinical shock.

c. The oxygen saturation probe should be placed on the infant's right upper extremity (pre-ductal) immediately after birth, with target values of 90-95% after the first 5 minutes of life.

d. The infant should be transported to the NICU immediately following stabilization.

II. **NICU Management**
A. Bedside RN weighs infant and places the monitor leads.
B. RT places the infant on CPAP via nasal prongs or mechanical ventilation if intubated. Care should be taken to keep CPAP in place at all times to avoid the development of atelectasis.
C. **Intubation criteria for CPAP infants:**
1. FiO2 >40% required to maintain SpO2 ≥90% for 1 hour
2. PaCO2>60 mm Hg
3. Repetitive apnea requiring bag-mask ventilation
4. Hemodynamic instability (low blood pressure and/or poor perfusion requiring volume or pressors for >4 hours)

2. Subsequent (up to 2): 1.25 ml/kg every12 hours
3. In the unstable infant, a test dose of 1 ml/kg may be given to check for tolerance. If tolerated, give
1.5 ml/kg to complete the Curosurf® dose
4. Maximum dosing: 5 ml/kg

<a id='96319f4c-9751-478b-afff-df7388975909'></a>

H. **Surfactant therapy** is most effective when given within the first 30-60 minutes of life and results in lower incidence of air leak and chronic lung disease compared to administration 2 or more hours after birth4. Surfactant administration should then be performed using the InSurE (Intubation-Surfactant-Extubation) method6:

1.  Intubate
2.  Instill Curosurf® 2.5 ml/kg with 5 Fr catheter through suction port of endotracheal tube adaptor
3.  Give 3 manual breaths with PIP 20 and PEEP 5
4.  Extubate and place on CPAP with PEEP of 5-7
5.  If the InSurE method is not used, surfactant can be administered using the traditional method:
    a.  Intubate patient and stabilize on SIMV with volume guarantee of 4.5-5 ml/kg
    b.  Position patient supine with neutral head position
    c.  Administer Curosurf® 2.5 ml/kg with 5 Fr catheter through suction port of endotracheal tube adaptor
    d.  Avoid suctioning for 1 hour post administration

<a id='8c9f64fb-c585-401d-986d-c4d8911f6439'></a>

I. **When considering surfactant therapy, remember:**

1. Pulmonary hemorrhage is not a contraindication to surfactant administration. On the contrary, surfactant may be deactivated by blood, so treatment with surfactant may be beneficial.
2. Infants treated with surfactant may have rapid changes in pulmonary mechanics, specifically, dramatic improvements in compliance. It is important to monitor oxygen saturation, ETCO2, tidal volumes, and blood gases closely in the period following administration to avoid excessive tidal volumes, hyperinflation, hypocarbia, hyperoxia or air leak.

I. **Rationale for the NEST**

Survival of infants at the extreme of prematurity has increased over the last few decades but significant rates of morbidity persist. These infants require detail oriented specialized care to obtain best outcomes. Multiple centers have created specialized care guidelines for these infants with improvements in survival and morbidity rates including chronic lung disease, intraventricular hemorrhage, growth failure and infection rates. For many units the specialized care included creation of specific care teams of physicians and nurses caring for the smallest babies as well as cohorting them physically within the NICU. The developmental care environment of extremely preterm infants maximizes sleep and carefully delivers appropriate levels of parent interaction including touch, sound and skin to skin care.

II. **Patient Considerations**

A. **Gestational Age**: Infants less than 29 weeks postmenstrual age should be admitted to the NEST and remain there until 32 weeks postmenstrual age. When there are space constraints, inborn or transferred babies with the lowest postmenstrual age should take priority over older infants, who will be moved out. Exceptions to this rule are possible due to considerations for clinical stability and family impact. Please discuss with the attending on service if exceptions will be made.

B. **Location**: Prior to the NICU expansion, room 4 (beds A-D, I) will be used for the NEST. Bed "C" should be occupied last to allow room for Kangaroo Care (KC). When appropriate, the NEST may overflow into the ECMO room. Tentatively, the NEST will move to the "pod" in PCU260 when the NICU expands across the 2nd floor.

C. **Environment**: Ambient noise levels should be 45-50 decbles with transient noise not to exceed 65 decibles. The volume of bedside alarms should be reduced to the minimum safety level. If conversation is required while in the NEST, a soft voice (library voice) should be used and every effort should be made to not talk over incubators. **All rounds should be conducted outside room 4.**

D. **Family centered care**: Families should be included in all care activities and provided opportunities to participate in and deliver developmental care with each visit. Kangaroo Care (KC) should be encouraged as soon and as often as possible. Consult Holding Guideline for KC readiness (See Appendix A NICU Holding Algorithm for reference). Infants may be held by parents as an exception to touch times. The goal is for holding to occur for at least one session of 60 minutes daily to allow infant to benefit from deeper sleep during KC.

# Toward Optimally Timed Cord Clamping

<a id='52a07a17-c741-4d96-8a48-f8830beaf2cf'></a>

Brittany Weldon, M.D.

<a id='1c6d07f0-9bbe-4fd0-92e3-851dc3af2f7c'></a>

I. **Background**

For many years, the standard of care for most deliveries has involved immediate clamping and cutting of the umbilical cord after delivery of the baby's body. This is part of the active management of labor, a series of actions that have been demonstrated to decrease the risk of severe maternal postpartum hemorrhage. Prior to the development of antenatal steroids and surfactant for the prevention and treatment of RDS in premature infants, there was interest in the effect of delaying cord clamping for possible respiratory benefits to the premature infant. Recently, there has been renewed interest and research in delayed cord clamping in both premature and full term newborns for other benefits

<a id='344a78d9-99aa-4f85-8a85-eb9790fd44ca'></a>

At the time of birth, approximately 50% of the total feto-placental blood volume is contained within the placenta. With the umbilical vessels intact, a complete circuit is made from the placenta, through the umbilical vein, to the baby, through the umbilical arteries and back to the placenta. With the first breath, the baby's pulmonary vasculature begins to dilate and that increased vascular bed coupled with uterine contractions directs additional blood volume from the placenta and into the newborn. A study in which term babies were delivered directly onto a scale demonstrated the transfusion occurring over time if the cord is left un-clamped. This supported similar data from earlier studies measuring the amount of blood in the baby and left in the placenta following various durations of delay in cord clamping. A separate study in preterm infants showed that those who underwent delayed cord clamping had higher overall blood volumes than those in whom immediate cord clamping had been performed. Several studies have estimated that the transfusion volume is approximately 20-30 mL/kg, and the vast majority of that transfusion occurs in the first 60 seconds.

II. Mechanism

The benefits conferred on both preterm and full term infants likely stems from the increased red blood cell volume following placento-fetal transfusion, as well as improved hemodynamic stability during the initial – and most substantial – moments of transition. When a baby is first born, the pulmonary vasculature is contracted with minimal blood flow. Placental blood is preferentially shunted through the patent foramen ovale into the left atrium of the heart and serves as the primary source of preload. Also, with the placenta attached, the total systemic blood pressure is lower, putting less pressure on the myocardium. If the umbilical cord is clamped prior to the establishment of sustained respiratory effort, the low-pressure placental system is removed from the newborn's circulation. There is an immediate spike in systemic blood pressure, or cardiac afterload, while, at the same time, the left atrium's primary source of preload is removed. There is less blood to fill the ventricles and the blood that is there likely has a lower oxygen concentration. The strongest effect of this is felt by the myocardium, which received its blood flow during diastole, and transient hypoxemia of the myocardium can result. The effect of this is clearly more severe in a fragile preterm infant. However, if the cord is left intact while respiration is established, the low-pressure placental system is replaced by a newly-dilated low-pressure pulmonary system, and the lungs become the primary source of blood to the left atrium. Then, when the umbilical cord is clamped and cut, the effect on the infant's hemodynamics is substantially lessened.

### III. Preterm Infants

Multiple prospective trials and reviews have concluded that delaying the clamping and cutting of the umbilical cord in vigorous premature babies results in a transfusion of fetal blood from the placenta to the baby. This extra blood provides improved hemodynamic stability in the initial transitioning period. However, in these fragile newborns, the benefits last a lot longer. They include:

Of course, no intervention is without risks, and placental transfusion to the newborn through delayed cord clamping has been associated with:

A. Increased peak bilirubin concentrations
B. Possibly an increased risk of requiring phototherapy
C. Possibly an increased risk of polycythemia, though premature infants have more of a tendency toward anemia.

However, given the substantial benefits and the ease with which we can, and already do, monitor for jaundice, many national and international organizations recommend delaying cord clamping in vigorous preterm infants, including: AAP, WHO, ACOG, ILCOR, NRP, RCOG, NICE, and others. Since we cannot yet perform resuscitative measures other than warming/drying/stimulation and bulb suctioning in a baby still attached by the umbilical cord, immediate cord clamping is still recommended in non-vigorous babies of any gestation that do not rapidly respond to basic measures. Preliminary studies are investigating the feasibility of performing more advanced resuscitation prior to umbilical cord clamping.

IV. Term Babies

Given their fortitude and improved reserves, the benefits of waiting for placento-fetal transfusion in term babies are more subtle, though the affected group is much larger. In areas of the world with high rates of anemia, the benefits have been known for a long time to outweigh the risks, but the benefits were less clear in babies born in resource-rich countries. Animal studies have long shown that iron deficiency with or without anemia can have long-term permanent neurologic implications in developing pups, and this has been corroborated by evidence in children. The additional PRBC transfusion received by babies when cord clamping is delayed provides up to an additional 2 months of iron stores for use when neurologic development needs it most. Recent studies have shown a decreased risk of iron deficiency with and without anemia following 3 minutes of delayed cord clamping for breast milk fed babies in a resource-rich country at 4-6 months of age. The same researchers followed the children out to four years of age and showed improved neurologic outcomes, especially fine motor skills in all babies and cognitive/behavioral outcomes in boys, in the delayed cord clamping group. Given the improvements in hemodynamic stability after birth and the long term benefits demonstrated even in a relatively small cohort, delaying umbilical cord clamping is now recommended in all vigorous babies by ILCOR, NRP, NICE, RCOG, WHO and ACOG.

There is still concern for an increased risk of hyperbilirubinemia requiring phototherapy in babies following delayed cord clamping, and possibly polycythemia, especially in those already at increased risk. At LPCH, the incidence of polycythemia by heel stick (hemo-concentrated) in high risk infants was 6/353 well babies screened. Four of these were borderline, so they were not repeated with venous sampling, and none were symptomatic or required admission to the NICU. In contrast, 8 babies in the same group were anemic on heel stick despite being at risk for polycythemia. Vigilance for hyperbilirubinemia is a must, and routine testing of all babies by heel stick at 24 hours of life has been routine at LPCH for years.

Importantly, studies of delayed cord clamping in term babies have shown no increased risk to the mother. For other endpoints – pH, APGAR scores, admission temperatures, PDA, and respiratory distress – there was no significant difference between the two interventions.

42 Part I-B: Delivery and Admission

V. **Toward Optimally Timed Cord Clamping**

It is likely that the optimal moment to clamp and cut the umbilical cord is not a specific time from birth, though that is certainly the easiest to measure and implement. The optimal moment likely has more to do with the physiologic state of the newborn infant in question. Ideally, we would be able to support the transition of all babies with the cord attached, and measure the stability of their blood volume and their ongoing reliance on placental support. We are not yet in a position to do either, and our protocol will likely evolve as more evidence and technology becomes available.

VI. **Our Practice Protocol**

The standard of care at LPCH is to wait until about 1 minute following birth in vigorous infants of all gestational ages to clamp and cut the umbilical cord with the following exceptions:

A. Babies born apneic and not responding to stimulation
B. Major congenital anomalies
C. Congenital heart block
D. Hydrops
E. Abruption
F. Placenta acreta
G. Hemorrhage
H. Any problem that concerns the pediatrician or obstetrician to the point that they feel delaying clamping and cutting the cord will put either the mother or the baby at risk
I. Parental request, including for umbilical cord blood banking

## VII. PROCEDURE FOR OPTIMALLY TIMED CORD CLAMPING

A. Vaginal Deliveries

1.  Delivered by OB
2.  Baby may be placed on the abdomen for care by the pediatrician or RN, or may be held by the OB at the obstetrician's preference.
3.  Pitocin is administered with delivery of the baby, per obstetrician's discretion.
4.  Caregiver will stimulate the baby to induce crying, causing expansion of the pulmonary vascular bed and facilitating the placento-fetal transfusion.
5.  Pediatric team to announce when 60 seconds has passed, the cord is clamped and cut, and care proceeds per NRP and Skin to Skin guidelines.
