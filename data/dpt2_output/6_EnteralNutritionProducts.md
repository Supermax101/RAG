# SELF-ASSESSMENT #1

An institution's nutrition support team has noticed an increase in the incidence of diarrhea in critically ill patients receiving enteral nutrition since institution of a new enteral nutrition formulary requiring nurses to decant enteral formulations from cans into containers prior to administration. Nursing refills EN administration containers every 8 hours with fresh enteral formula. Which of the following is the likely cause of this occurrence?

A. Use of an open enteral formula system.
B. Use of ready to hang EN product.
C. Use of EN formulas beyond specified hang time.
D. Use of EN in sicker patients.

# SELF-ASSESSMENT #2

It is determined that a patient will go home on PN as the primary means of nutrition. The patient had a central venous catheter placed prior to initiating PN and has been receiving PN at goal regimen for 4 days. Which of the following is MOST appropriate in an effort to provide a safe transition home?

A. Provide patient and caregiver home PN education on the day of discharge.
B. Contact home infusion company to determine stock products and potential shortages.
C. Allow home infusion company to provide patient and caregiver education.
D. Change nutrition support formulation upon transition to home or alternative care site.

# ENTERAL NUTRITION

*   Provision of nutrients to the gastrointestinal tract through the use of an enteral access device
*   250,000 hospitalized patients are supported using enteral nutrition
*   Used in a variety of settings
    *   Hospital → long term care / rehab → home

• Sterile container or bag, pre-filled with sterile, liquid enteral formula by the manufacturer
• Considered ready to administer products ("ready to hang")
• Large volume bags or containers (1000 mL and 1500 mL)
• Longer hang time: 24 to 48 hours
  - Administration sets/tubing must be changed every 24 hours
  - Per manufacturer, no more than 1 tubing spike per container/bag
• Less contamination risk (infection), less diarrhea
• Addition of medications and modular products not recommended
• Reduced nursing time

- Enteral nutrition formulas can be delivered as part of a closed or open system.
- Closed enteral nutrition systems provide decreased contamination risk, reduced nursing time, and can be more cost effective.
- ASPEN recommendations exist for both enteral and parenteral nutrition labeling.
- Clear communication and detailed education can provide a smooth transition of patients from hospital to home or alternative care sites.
