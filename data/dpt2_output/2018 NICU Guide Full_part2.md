I. Introduction

Fetal hydrops (hydrops fetalis) is defined as abnormal fluid accumulation in at least two different fetal compartments detected by ultrasound (US). These compartments include skin (subcutaneous edema) and serous body cavities (pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, ascites). Polyhydramnios and placental thickening are often present. Fetal hydrops can be divided into immune and non-immune. Given early diagnosis and treatment of rhesus (Rh) isoimmunization, non-immune fetal hydrops (NIFH) now accounts for majority (80-90%) of fetal hydrops. 1-7

<a id='893049c1-60d4-4e4b-9ba9-15ca09e05aa9'></a>

The incidence of fetal hydrops is ~3 in 10,000 live births but overall incidence is much higher given high fetal death rates.3 Fetal hydrops must be urgently evaluated by a maternal-fetal medicine (MFM) specialist given its high mortality (50%), possibility of fetal therapy in some cases, and to identify the cause. This information will help in planning the delivery, post-natal management and future pregnancies (inherited causes carry a risk of recurrence). 1-7

<a id='15146914-75a1-41f8-8174-d4f103a9d98c'></a>

Factors that have been reported to be associated with high mortality include younger gestational age at the time of diagnosis of fetal hydrops or at the time birth, low Apgar score at 5 minutes, the presence of two or more serous cavity effusions, need for high levels of support (e.g. HFOV), and congenital anomalies.3, 6-7

<a id='1f7a8a6c-ce8f-4b72-a5ec-96b7844150fa'></a>

Because pleural and pericardial effusions impair breathing and cardiac function, and because delivery of an infant with fetal hydrops is often premature, extensive resuscitation is often required in the delivery room. Therefore, it is important to be prepared for such delivery. Also, while subspecialty consultations are crucial in the evaluation of the etiology of fetal hydrops, a newborn may not survive beyond delivery room. Therefore, there may be limited time for diagnostic workup and subspecialty consultation, raising the importance of the awareness of the causes of fetal hydrops and related diagnostic tests.

II. **Etiology of non-immune fetal hydrops (NIFH):**

A. The etiology of NIFH is multifactorial. There is variation in the frequency of etiologies on depending on whether fetal deaths or only live births were included. Additionally, one diagnosis may be assigned to different etiological groups. For example, Turner syndrome may have been assigned to chromosomal disorders, syndromes, lymphatic (cystic hygroma) or cardiac etiologies.

B. Overall frequencies of etiology from recent and/or large reports/reviews 1-7 are as follows:

1. Cardiovascular (10-20%)
   a. Structural cardiac anomalies
   b. Cardiac arrhythmia (fetal SVT, fetal bradyarrhythmia)
2. Chromosomal/syndromic (15-70%)
   a. Turner, trisomies, chromosomal deletions/duplications
3. Idiopathic (17%)
4. Hematological (7-10%)

III. **Diagnostic evaluation**

A. Diagnosing or ruling out a genetic cause for NIFH is important because there is a risk of recurrence in future pregnancies (25% if autosomal recessive inheritance). While subspecialty consultations (i.e. genetics, cardiology, infectious disease) and recommended tests can be done in a step-wise manner in NICU, also listed are the diagnostic tests to be ordered the infant does not survive beyond delivery room

(or dies shortly thereafter), giving minimal time for obtaining consultations.

B. Before delivery the obstetrician may have done detailed anatomy including US, fetal ECHO, Doppler US (peak middle cerebral artery flow to evaluate for fetal anemia), maternal blood type & antibody screen infectious disease workup on mother (e.g. parvo, CMV), hemoglobin electrophoresis & G6PD testing (if fetal anemia), and amniocentesis for karyotype/CGH/infectious disease workup.

C. The following examinations are recommended should the infant die soon after birth:

1. Echocardiogram
2. Chest XR
3. Abdominal US
4. Head US
5. CGH to Stanford Cytogenetics: 1-3ml of blood in a green-topped sodium heparinized tube. If the infant survives, the diagnostic genetic testing is to be guided by the Medical Genetics team. For example, the Medical Genetics service may recommend first a karyotype, CGH or a gene panel for specific conditions depending on the findings. But, should the infant pass away in delivery room, or soon thereafter, CGH is usually the test to be ordered.
6. Placental pathology (OB)
7. Autopsy
   a. Skeletal survey (can be done at autopsy)
   b. Photos (can be done at autopsy)
8. Skin biopsy for fibroblast culture (~3x3mm piece / punch biopsy, send in normal saline to Stanford Cytogenetics)
9. Consider:
   a. Aspiration of pleural fluid for cytology, protein, albumin
   b. CBC, transaminases, liver function tests, CK
   c. Hemoglobin electrophoresis (for thalassemias if fetal anemia, depending on ethnicity)
10. Family history especially with regards to: ethnic background, consanguinity, fetal loss, death in infancy, congenital malformations, developmental delay/regression, cardiomyopathies, maternal lupus (if fetal bradycardia), maternal blood type, hemoglobinopathies

D. If infant survives the following are recommended:

1. Above imaging tests on all infants with fetal hydrops
2. Other tests depending on initial physical/imaging/laboratory findings.
3. Medical Genetics consultation: recommended in all cases of fetal hydrops, unless cause known and

IV.
**Initial management of a newborn with fetal hydrops in the delivery room**

A. Each infant with hydrops will require different procedures and the following list must be altered based upon each specific case. Speak with the MFMs prior to the delivery and review the ultrasounds to determine the exact location of fluid that may require drainage. Nearly all of the supplies listed below can be found in the Neonatal Code Cart. Those that are in other locations are specified below.

B. **Potential Procedures:**

1.  **Intubation:** Establishment of ventilation is a priority and prompt intubation is often necessary. The airway is often edematous and friable, therefore, your most skilled person should attempt intubation immediately.8 Prepare an endotracheal tube (ETT) one size smaller than expected due to airway edema.

    b. Other standard intubation supplies
    c. *Optional*: stylet for ETT
    d. Anesthesia bag

2.  **Thoracentesis / Paracentesis:** Discuss sequence of planned fluid removal prior to delivery (i.e. thoracentesis vs. paracentesis; right vs. left).
    a. 16 or 18 gauge angiocaths (6) – [NICU supply room or anesthesia cart]
    b. Stopcocks (4) - [NICU supply room]
    c. Tubing (connect stopcocks & syringes) - [NICU supply room]
    d. 20mL syringes (multiple)
    e. Argyle chest tubes (2)
    f. Scalpel & Kelly clamp - [NICU supply room]

3.  **Pericardiocentesis:** Alert Cardiology to the need for a stat ECHO for cardiac function and evaluation of a pericardial effusion.

4.  **Umbilical venous catheter (UVC) emergency line** placement for code medication administration
    a. Umbilical Line Kit
    b. 5Fr single lumen catheter
    c. 3.5Fr single lumen catheter
    d. O neg pRBCs → Draw up 3-4, 20mL syringes from blood bank or dry pack in CVICU/NICU

2. Alert on call Neonatology attending for impending delivery.

3. Estimate true weight to be LESS than hydropic weight. (e.g. – 2.5kg EFW – use 2kg as actual weight, depending on degree of hydrops)

4. Increased pressures may be required to ensure appropriate ventilation. Use anesthesia bag in delivery room to assess lung compliance.

5. Once intubated if there is a large pleural effusion and fluid removal is sluggish, consider using a scalpel and Kelly clamp to create a larger access to the pleural space. Fluid should be displaced by positive pressure ventilation.

Complex Coordinated Deliveries

I. **What are Complex Deliveries?**

The Fetal and Pregnancy Health Program is a multidisciplinary program for the management of complex fetal patients. After serial imaging and extensive discussions among the relevant specialists, some cases will require a highly-coordinated delivery of the fetus with careful direction of resources and personnel. Examples of cases requiring complex, coordinated deliveries include but are not limited to: severe airway or lung anomalies with anticipation of difficult ventilation after delivery, or cardiac diagnoses requiring urgent intervention, such as congenital heart block or HLHS with restrictive atrial septum. Ideally, deliveries are coordinated to permit a scheduled cesarean section and simultaneous arrangements in the OR or cath lab to accommodate the newborn infant's needs. These events necessitate the availability and coordination of an obstetric OR team to care for the mother, a NICU delivery team to provide initial stabilization and vascular access, and the specialty team (surgical or interventional cath) to address the needs of the baby.

<a id='f543bd46-4744-4e1c-86d1-1b6fbd0748e6'></a>

The Fetal and Pregnancy Health team drafts a full case description and delivery checklist specific to the fetal patient, which are available ~ 2 weeks prior to the scheduled complex delivery. Note that for highly complex cases requiring multiple teams (i.e., EXIT procedures), daily sub-specialty call lists are also generally distributed for 1-2 weeks prior to scheduled delivery. In the case of an unexpected earlier delivery, use the checklist below for roles/supplies needed.

<a id='6097d114-ffa8-4040-9abf-6ab934e1d24c'></a>

## II. Types of Complex Deliveries

<a id='94876bc3-30e1-4d20-b064-1720c7a41f5d'></a>

1. **EXIT procedure** (Ex-Utero Intrapartum Treatment) is delivery and management of the fetus while still on placental support. This involves a cesarean section with the mother under deep anesthesia in the main operating room. It is set up when there is a high enough concern that the airway will be obstructed upon delivery, and the infants remains on placental support until an airway can be secured.

<a id='2ca1427b-2d5f-42c3-a0cb-87dc4cabda3b'></a>

1.  **Basic Steps**
    a. Mother is placed under general anesthesia.
    b. MFM performs a hysterotomy with careful control of bleeding.
    c. Pediatric Surgery and MFM teams deliver head and shoulders.
    d. Pediatric Anesthesiology places a pulse oximeter on fetus and administers sedation (e.g., IM fentanyl and pavulon)
    e. In most cases, ENT or Pediatric Anesthesia will perform direct laryngoscopy and attempt intubation.
    f. If breath sounds are auscultated and intubation is considered successful, the umbilical cord will be clamped and the infant handed to Neonatology.
    g. If unsuccessful, intubation with rigid bronchoscopy will be performed. If intubation cannot be achieved with this step, tracheostomy and/or neck mass resection will be performed with the fetus on placental support. Neonatology must be prepared to assist with resuscitation during the procedure if complications arise.

h. In fetal cases with classic features of severe Congenital High Airway Obstruction (CHAOS), intubation may not be attempted; rather, tracheostomy will be rapidly undertaken.

i. In some clinical scenarios, such as cystic hygroma, cannulation for ECMO may be performed if tracheostomy or neck mass resection cannot be performed. If the infant decompensates; ECMO may not be considered appropriate.

2. Indication: Severe congenital airway anomalies including cystic hygroma, laryngeal/tracheal atresia, severe microretrognathia, cervical teratoma or other cervical or pharyngeal masses. Some large bronchopulmonary malformations may also be candidates for EXIT to allow for immediate airway stabilization during a potentially difficult resuscitation.

<a id='246c8bab-aa5d-43e9-8e5a-8c80347c500e'></a>

2. **Side-by-Side OR** is when a delivery is planned in the main LPCH OR with a separate OR on standby for the baby with a full surgical team prepared for emergent surgery.

1. **Indication**: Large bronchopulmonary malformations, which may impede the ability to adequately ventilate the infant post-delivery, and congenital heart block requiring urgent pacemaker placement after delivery.

3. **OR to Cath lab** is when the cath lab is on hold at the time of the scheduled delivery. Cardiology is involved in the delivery to be on standby for an immediate echo and a decision for urgent intervention in the cath lab is made.

<a id='e4233db4-03ca-4a23-b1fd-231e8cc0e58e'></a>

1. Indication: Severe Cardiac deliveries including HLHS with intact or restrictive atrial septum

## I. Discharge Checklist
Designed for those patient that will be hospitalized for >2 weeks. Open a new note and choose "Progress Note" for type but do not insert any smart text. Use the dot phrase. DCCHECKLIST. To save it click "share". The note will sit in the "Incomplete" section of the notes and anyone can add to it. Begin to complete the tasks 1-2 weeks prior to DC. Use it as a tool to communicate to your colleagues what has been done. Do not ever "sign" the note; only "share" it. Prior to discharge the note must be deleted.

## II. Health Care Maintenance
When writing the first progress note on a patient, include the. HCM dot phrase at the bottom of the Health Care Maintenance box. This will insert information regarding HUS, MRI, and a chart for discharge follow up appointments.

As you consult services please make a note of them there and as the baby gets closer to discharge it can be used to track when they need to be seen as outpatient. This will eventually become a permanent part of the note.

## III. Identification of the patient's PCP (at minimum 7 days before the target discharge date)

A. When your patient's status changes from level 3 (critical care) to level 2 (intensive care), the Case Manager will approach families about identifying a Primary Care Physician (PCP).

B. Once the PCP is identified, that information can be input into EPIC under "treatment team"

C. The patient's parents should make the PCP appointment for 1-2 days post discharge, and let the team know the day and time of the appointment.

D. For the Gardner Clinic: Use the following link to identify Gardner Health Centers in Santa Clara and San Mateo counties. https://gardnerfamilyhealth.org/health-centers/find-a-health-center/.

## IV. The Complex Primary Care Clinic (CPCC)
Consideration for the CPCC should be discussed in rounds and, if possible, during multidisciplinary meetings held every Tuesday in the NICU conference room. If the patient is a candidate for the CPCC the Case Manager will confirm patient acceptance into the clinic, and if approved, the provider requests an appointment in EPIC. Patients must fit the criteria below.

A. Followed by ≥ 3 pediatric or surgical specialists

B. Children who are technology dependent

C. Have frequent or prolonged hospitalization

<a id='129db210-499d-435a-bd81-1ed07ad40def'></a>

V. **Consultant follow up appointments at LPCH**

A. Identify and order outpatient follow up appointments in EPIC 1- 2 weeks prior to discharge. For all outpatient referrals order under "Discharge Follow-up Appointment/Referral Request" with the exception of Complex Care in which case you go to the "Med/Order Rec" section of the ADT navigator then enter "Ambulatory referral to Complex Care" under "Prescription/Outpatient Order".

60 Part I-C: Discharging & Transferring Patients

B. Audiology and Hearing Screening

1. All patients born at LPCH must have a hearing screen prior to discharge.
2. Patients admitted from home or transferred from another hospital do not need a hearing screen if they passed an ALGO at an outside hospital. The discharge summary should state that the test is not medically indicated.
3. Patients born at LPCH and readmitted need a repeat ALGO if they have hyperbilirubinemia, received potentially ototoxic medications or are admitted to NICU for > 5 days.
4. Failed ALGO: may be repeated once. If patient refers on second ALGO a referral is made to audiology.
5. Newborns designated as being at increased risk of hearing loss will be identified at multidisciplinary rounds and referred for inpatient audiologic evaluation performed by an audiologist.
6. For more information on hearing screening please refer to LPCH policies: *Newborn Hearing Screening Program* and *Hearing Assessment for Infants at Increased Risk*, available on the intranet.

<a id='93042f22-1cd0-4f28-bb4f-b606043468e2'></a>

C. Babies going home on NG or GT Feeds

1. All patients going home from the NICU/ICN with GT, JT, NGT or NJT should be referred to the GI Clinic and should be seen within 2 weeks following discharge.
2. Place referral via EPIC, mark "**Urgent**" and indicate "pt has feeding tube, needs GI visit by wk of__". (This will alert the PASC Appointment team to contact Peds GI NPs if there is a scheduling problem).
3. If it is known that there are no available appointments within specific time frame, please contact the Peds GI Fellow or Peds GI NP @ 650-723-5070 for an appointment in Urgent Clinic.
4. Assess family's comfort with ability to replace dislodged NG and/or GTs. If parents are not comfortable, consider Skilled Nursing visits to provide further education/support at a local level (Consult with Case Manager on your team).
5. Once patient is seen by the Peds GI Service (either inpt or outpt), family can come to Peds GI clinic or call office to get help with tube care as needed. The **Peds GI NP/RNs & providers will NOT be able to assist patient if they are not an established Peds GI patient**. In this case, families would either see their primary subspecialty team (ie. Surgery, if tube was placed by this service), Primary Care or local Urgent Care Clinic.
6. The Case Managers will indicate in EPIC under "Snapshot" in the field **Patient Care Coordination Note** the name(s) of Home Health Nursing Agency and/or DME company providing services including contact numbers. (Will also be noted in the Case Manager's notes).
7. If there is a family struggling with decision over whether to go home with an NG tube vs GT placement, the Peds GI NPs will to come talk with families about the care of these tubes following transition to home. Please consult the Case Manager on your team who can interface with the Peds GI NP team.

<a id='2160937b-251e-4cec-8805-cd70586e4c17'></a>

D. If PT/OT follow up is needed, the PT/OT will provide a paper order to be signed by the attending neonatologist, and the PT/OT will arrange outpatient follow-up.
E. If a patient meets criteria, order high risk infant follow up on EPIC if not yet scheduled. ("Discharge Follow-up Appointment/Referral Request" for Developmental-Behavioral Pediatrics).

B. The LPCH consultant should provide sign out to the follow up consultant.

C. The Case Manager will schedule follow up appointments with all outside consultants.

D. Records should be sent in a separate packet for the consultant (i.e. copies of the echocardiogram, LPCH consult notes, discharge summary).

<a id='cb8a7469-17fc-4a9b-91c9-ec559788c06c'></a>

## VII. ROP Follow up

A. Drs. Gaynon, Moshfeghi, and Koo are the LPCH retinal specialists and must approve discharge for any patient with ROP.

B. ROP discharge follow up appointments **must be made** prior to discharge as this can be a high risk medico-legal situation for LPCH and the ROP specialists. Place referral via Epic.

C. The USA will call the ophthalmologist's office and either schedule an appointment for the patient or confirm that an appointment has already been scheduled.

<a id='324c57cc-9800-4065-9de3-7ae8ce9f0384'></a>

VIII. **Discharge supplies and home health follow up needs**

A. Notify the Case Manager of needed supplies (i.e. home oxygen, enteral feeding supplies, ostomy supplies, special formula). This must be done a minimum of 7 days prior to the target discharge date.
B. Notify the Case Manager of nursing care needs.
C. The Case Manager will make Agency referrals.

<a id='e9b24dde-ae1b-4aa5-b40d-80f13f640caa'></a>

## IX. Car Seat Testing

### A. Indications for Car Seat testing

Infants <37 wks gestation at birth OR who meet 1 of the following criteria:

1.  Weight at discharge less than 5 lbs (2.27 kg)
2.  With lung disease requiring supplemental oxygen at the time of discharge
3.  With reflux requiring medication or thickened feedings
4.  Any infant sent home on an apnea monitor
5.  Infants with known physical or developmental limitations who are not able to tolerate sitting positions- this may include infants with decreased tone, airway malformations or other congenital disorders

<a id='0f73ca05-9ea1-46d8-b8cb-bf19a31f0dfa'></a>

Some infants are unable to tolerate a sitting position because of physical or developmental limitations and must be placed in an alternative restraint device. Placing an infant in a car bed will not guarantee that these conditions will not occur while traveling. Use of a standard car seat if possible is preferred. Refer to: Alternative Restraint Devices in Appendix B and Special Needs Appendix D of the LPCH Child Passenger Safety and Car

B. Equipment
1. Pulse Oximeter
2. Cardiorespiratory monitor
3. Car seat that will be used to transport the infant home

<a id='dc248b53-3e50-4de0-ad08-6f34cca6f0bf'></a>

C. Process

1. Upon identification of an infant requiring monitoring, arrangements should be made for the parents to bring in the car seat that will be used to transport the infant home. This should occur several days prior to discharge; for babies in the WBN, the day before discharge.
2. Testing should be done immediately after or between feedings.
3. Place infant on cardio-respiratory and O2 saturation monitors. If infant is going home on a monitor, hook the baby up to the home monitor. Obtain baseline measurements for 10 minutes before placing infant in car seat.
4. The infant must maintain parameters set on the home monitor to be considered safe
5. May utilize baseline measurements if monitors already in place.
6. Place infant in car seat. Bolster with blankets to keep baby in optimal position while maintaining manufacturer's and AAP recommendations.

<a id='5544e02d-96fe-4dbd-9e5b-0d097b78c9da'></a>

<::A black and white line drawing depicts a baby sleeping in a car seat. The baby is wearing a dotted cap and is secured by a harness with a buckle at the chest level. The car seat has a padded headrest and side supports.: figure::>

<a id='b391746e-ed45-43d9-9707-954e16c96554'></a>

There should not be anything between the baby and the car seat that did not originally come with the car seat. The angle of the seat should be in accordance with the manufacturers' instructions (usually 45 ° for newborns) and allow the infant's torso and head to rest back preventing chin to chest position. Additional head padding and strap covers included with the seat often need to be removed for proper harness fit on tiny babies and to prevent the head from slumping forward.

Process for Basic and Complex Discharges 63

7. Monitor infant for 90 to 120 min or the duration of travel, whichever is longer.
8. Assess for apnea, bradycardia, or oxygen desaturation episodes during car seat observation.
9. Child must pass the challenge in the Car Restraint (CR) they will be discharged in, even if it means testing in a car bed after failing in a standard infant CR.

<a id='0b8e9163-48da-4222-8679-253f46a68e1d'></a>

D. Criteria to determine Pass/Fail:

Test is abnormal and considered a fail if any of the following occurs

1. HR< 80 bpm for > 4 sec with oxygen desaturation < 88%
2. HR< 80 bpm for 10 seconds without oxygen desaturation
3. Apnea > 20 sec
4. Steady decline in oxygen saturation to < 88% without spontaneous recovery. NOTE: the O2 saturation criteria may be different for infants with congenital heart disease.
5. Persistent labored respiratory effort despite repositioning.
6. If infant exhibits significant event, reposition or stimulate, document intervention and terminate the test.
7. If the infant fails the initial test, one can be repeated. It is usually best to wait 24 hours.

<a id='20495558-9261-4841-a1ac-d9d2a8f8ded6'></a>

E. During re-test:

1. Closely check monitor connections
2. Check infant's position and harness to ensure proper fit and position
3. Check angle of CR is at manufacturer's recommended 45°

<a id='789232a0-146d-460f-aa92-1befd5ed3a9c'></a>

**F.** Two failed tests will require further evaluation

1. An extended stay may be required to further monitor/treat apnea, desaturations, bradycardia
2. A new car restraint system may be required. A repeat test in the car bed or alternative restraint must be passed prior to discharge.
   a. A different standard infant car seat may be utilized. Infant only car seats with smaller weight limits (4- 22 lbs) provide the best fit.
   b. A car bed can be obtained from Distribution Supply but should only be used when upright position is medically or surgically unsafe (minimum weight 5 lbs). Advise the parent to use car bed until infant passes re-test and discuss with the infant's pediatrician when to re-test car seat monitoring (usually in 4 weeks).

# Comfort Care in the NICU

<a id='3af7b756-870b-4a25-adf8-83150acaae0a'></a>

I. **General**

In our culture, the death of an infant is a rare event. Most parents have limited experience with death and even less experience with the death of an infant. This is their worst nightmare. Parents often feel anger, fear, sadness, and helplessness. Your presence and demeanor will be crucial to their ability to handle and interpret the experience. Compassion, empathy and respect, both toward the family and their infant, are essential. Patience, gentleness, and awareness of cultural and religious diversity are also essential. Give clear, concise, and accurate information without euphemisms. Repeat the information as often as the family needs. Allow families to be involved in the decisions being made about their infant's care.

<a id='1aabaef9-2f3a-42be-bc3f-04115c8fe442'></a>

Two thirds of all infant deaths occur during the neonatal period. The most preterm and the smallest infants represent a large proportion of these deaths. Congenital malformations also contribute significantly. Therefore, there is validity to feeling that the NICU experiences a lot of deaths.

<a id='f4878887-844f-4ad0-a180-d9e83f152adc'></a>

## II. Communication

Good communication with families is essential. Families want to be included in the decision making about their infant. Families want to understand their infant's condition. For this to occur, we need to ask parents what they know about their infant's condition, so that we can then clarify missing or poorly understood issues. When explaining or clarifying the infant's condition we need to use concrete words. Using euphemisms often results in giving parents false information or hopes. Words like stable, good, or better can convey more hope than warranted and should be avoided. We must be clear about which information we are confident with and about which information we are less confident. For example, with a heart defect we are confident in our ability to describe the defect the infant has. Conversely, with some brain abnormalities, it may be difficult to predict the precise outcome for the individual child and describing a range of outcomes is appropriate.

<a id='882ee6d8-0bd9-4883-b49a-2430609cdae9'></a>

When parents are experiencing emotional distress, often we want to say something to reduce or remove the pain. We do not have the ability to reduce their pain and unfortunately, people often say unhelpful things. Many comments (i.e. you are young, you can have more children; at least you have other children) are unhelpful and devalue the life of this individual child. Being silent can be very powerful. Fortunately, research shows that even when we misspeak, if our actions and words convey empathy, compassion, and respect, parents are able to overlook our poorly formed words and remember we cared about their infant.

<a id='b24e4569-83fa-45d2-ba20-4d646daf505e'></a>

Ideally decisions regarding transitioning to comfort care occur over a series of conversations. Essential to these conversations is the development and the nurturing of trust and respect. Families do not make decisions based on ethics. Frequently a key factor in their decision-making is if they perceive that we care about their infant and if they trust us. If these two components are lost, it becomes challenging to reach the goal of providing care that is in the best interest of their infant.

<a id='67081f4d-fe91-4cc8-a556-c6ad6a7c9bbf'></a>

The series of conversations should include what is clearly known about their infant; what tests, imaging, labs,
etc will provide further information. Also included should be a range of expected outcomes. The concepts of
intensive care versus comfort care ideally are discussed prior to a decision. At this point it is important to
clearly state that a decision is not being requested. This is a time of sharing information with the parents and
family about different goals of care and how these goals relate to their infant. Subsequent conversations
include how this family wishes to transition to comfort care and which components of care provide comfort or
suffering.

<a id='a7587d3f-9a56-45ec-a79a-65a7415d08be'></a>

Sometimes the infant's condition does not give us as much time as we wish for these conversations to occur.

Comfort Care in the NICU 67
Our goal is to provide the same information, but in a tighter timeframe. Whenever possible and appropriate we should acknowledge that the decisions are being made in response to the infant's condition. Death is not a decision the parents or medical team make, it's the result of the infant's condition. Parents should not be made to feel that they are responsible for their infant's death.

<a id='2b3257bd-6bae-4c44-8b9a-766329ec4002'></a>

Lastly, we must include in our discussions what death looks like. Many families have limited experience with death. We should prepare them for what they may see, such as gasping, changes in color, being cold, and that these may be cyclical. An infant may appear blue, then pink up and later blue again. Explaining to parents how death may look prior to transitioning to comfort care hopefully will make the experience less frightening.

<a id='3f2aee75-7bc6-4f49-8c7d-0810348a3d33'></a>

### III. Intensive Care vs. Comfort Care

The goals of intensive care and comfort care are very different. These goals need to be clarified for parents. The goal of intensive care is to support the individual through a disease process so that the individual gets well or has a meaningful life at the end of the treatment. The goal of comfort care is to continue only interventions that provide comfort; interventions that provide more pain or distress than comfort are discontinued. Either mode of care (intensive or comfort) provides care to the infant. Parents greatly fear that their infant won't be cared for. The emphasis remains on caring for the infant, only the goal changes. Since the word withdrawing connotes removing something and not replacing it with something else, "withdrawing" should be avoided. Care is not withdrawn; the goal of care is changed. The ventilators is not withdrawn, but is removed so the suffering from the ventilator is gone.

<a id='1bd5db50-dc6a-4c68-a18b-791b87b92aab'></a>

When the parents and medical team decide to pursue comfort care, the comfort care order set, "Neonatal Comfort Care Supplemental Orders," is initiated in Epic. The attending physician should enter an order to clarify the goals of care, such as a Do Not Resuscitate or other order to clarify which interventions are aligned with the family's wishes. All other orders that do not provide comfort to the infant are discontinued.

<a id='f4011f37-8c41-4d4f-87c3-40ec4da6aeab'></a>

IV. **Palliative Care vs. End-of-Life Care**

Unfortunately, many parents and health care providers assume that palliative care and end-of-life/hospice care are the same thing. Palliative care focuses on the infant, parents, and family. Initially palliative care may include cure-oriented and disease modifying care with additional emphasis on relief of suffering which includes physical, psychological, social, emotional, and spiritual suffering. As the life-threatening condition progresses, cure- oriented, disease modifying care is replaced with greater emphasis on relief of pain and suffering. End-of-life care is the care delivered when it is expected that death is almost certain and will occur shortly. Therefore end-of-life care is a part of, palliative care, but not synonymous with, palliative care.

<a id='976e4472-0648-46c0-9c38-2e6cff12971f'></a>

V. **When Will the Infant Die?**

No one can ever predict the length of time until death. Even in the seemingly "easy case" one should refrain from predicting the timing of death. If the infant survives longer than expected, parents often question whether the wrong decision was made. When the infant survives longer than expected, the parents have more time to spend with their infant. It is easier for parents to understand this if the uncertainty of the timing of death is discussed in conversations prior to the infant living longer than expected. Depending on the circumstances, if the infant survives longer than 24 hours it can be important to meet again with the family to discuss the goals of care. The parents often need to hear that the reasons the parents and medical team made the decision to transition to comfort care are still valid. During this meeting, there should be discussion about whether the parents would prefer the infant to be discharged to home or remain in the hospital.

<a id='36a1fb56-faff-42f4-8ff1-b75b752b90b0'></a>

VI. **Religious and Cultural Issues**

It is important to ask parents if they have any religious or cultural practices we can facilitate. Some parents will

68 Part I-C: Delivery and Admission
ask for a special blessing, anointment, or prayer. If the parents have a religious person they wish to contact, arrangements are made for the person to attend to the family and infant. LPCH has chaplains available to assist families (pager 2PRAY). The majority of the time religious and cultural issues can be accommodated. Efforts must be made to make these accommodations. The only time accommodations are not made is if the infant's condition does not allow or the accommodation would be dangerous in the hospital environment (e.g. lighting candles).

<a id='8a04211f-5cfc-4c02-ae58-8ed17f5e603e'></a>

## VII. Pain Management

Comfort measures often include swaddling and being held by family members or staff, when the parents wish to take a break. Narcotics and benzodiazepines may be needed to control pain. The sublingual route eliminates the need for IV access and is the preferred route for pain control if the infant does not already have an indwelling catheter. The fear of hastening death by providing narcotics to control pain is NOT an acceptable reason for withholding appropriate pain medications. If an infant has been receiving a paralytic, it is reversed or the medical team needs to assure that it is no longer effective prior to removing the ventilator.

<a id='7f11ddfb-f3d6-41f6-96af-954a86357e01'></a>

Prior to transitioning to comfort care, a plan for pain control should be made. There are several considerations to be explored when developing this plan. The infant's diagnosis and physiology are a guide. Remembering that no one can predict when death will occur, plans for pain control should include the simultaneous possibility that death may occur quickly or that death may occur over a longer time than anticipated.

<a id='a1e84854-3766-4fe4-adeb-374dd7958f00'></a>

There are several routes that can be used for pain control. Each route has advantages and disadvantages to be considered. The oral/enteral route requires the ability of the infant to suck and swallow or the presence of a feeding tube. Feeding tubes may not be ideal for the infant or family, who may wish to see the infant's face without any medical devices (some parents have never seen their infant this way). Conversely repeatedly placing a feeding tube may not be comfortable for the infant. There are concerns that the oral/enteral route may not be as effective as other routes due to first-pass metabolism in the liver and decreased perfusion to the GI tract as death becomes closer. Some infants have central lines in place. These lines can be saline locked so the infant and parents are unencumbered with tubing and pumps. Unfortunately, many of our lines require lines and pumps to maintain patency. Discussion with the parents should include the acceptability of lines and pumps or if another method should be chosen. PIVs are generally avoided due to the unpredictability of the patency of an individual PIV and the difficulty of replacement especially as perfusion decreases. Intramuscular and rectal routes are not recommended due to inability to titrate and variability of absorption of these routes. The sublingual route accesses the capillaries under the tongue with high permeability, resulting in fast absorption and high bioavailability, especially for lipophilic medications. Fentanyl is a lipophilic drug and therefore has better absorption sublingually than morphine. The ready availability of this route and the absorption of fentanyl are the reasons that sublingual fentanyl is generally our first choice for pain management for the NICU infants.

<a id='c6a72393-9989-4065-a376-9808564905d0'></a>

To determine the appropriate dosing, the first issue to consider is whether the infant is opiate naïve or not. Generally standard doses can be initially used for the opiate naïve infant. For the non-opiate naïve infant higher starting doses are required. In infants who are receiving continuous infusions prior to transitioning to comfort care, the amount the infant receives in 24 hours is the infant's baseline. Further doses may need to be increased from this starting point.

<a id='18afe384-2682-4c3e-84ec-d73d3316743c'></a>

The fear of hastening death is NOT a reason to deny escalating narcotic dosing to treat pain and/or dyspnea.
The principle of "double-effect" states that a harmful effect of a treatment, even death, is permissible if that
effect is not intended and is a side effect of a beneficial action, like treating pain. In fact, several studies
indicate that there is no relationship between duration of survival and administration of opiates and that
possibly good pain control increases survival. In the NICU, various medications are titrated to effect and in
some cases, end up with higher doses than we use for the majority of infants. For example, we titrate
Dopamine to treat hypotension, or titrate Morphine and Versed in order to improve oxygenation and ventilation
in a mechanically ventilated infant. Titrating opioids and sedatives to manage a dying infant's pain and/or

In Palliative Care, the standard of care for escalation of dosing is by a percentage increase. _In general, a percentage increase of less than 25% above baseline is ineffective._ For mild to moderate pain dosing should be increased by 25-50% and for moderate to severe pain dosing should be increased by 50-100%. If the infant is in a pain/dyspnea crisis then escalation of opioids should occur every 10 to 15 minutes. Note that an infant with rapidly increasing needs can deplete the narcotics in the unit. If this is likely to occur or is occurring, the pharmacy should be notified in order to expedite timely administration of medications. It may be beneficial for the pharmacist to come to the bedside to facilitate timely administration to control the infant's pain/dyspnea. It may be helpful to think of this situation as an end-of-life emergency and just like a resuscitation that requires close teamwork with the NICU and pharmacy teams.

<a id='59ee522c-7a1a-496b-b5c1-9af748b7573d'></a>

### VIII. Nutrition

Not providing nutrition is an emotional topic that may need to be discussed with the parents depending on the infant's condition and the family's wishes. Feeding an infant represents nurturing. Not providing nutrition may feel like not caring for the infant. Some infants have no functional GI tract and therefore enteral nutrition is not possible. Some infants are not neurologically intact and cannot actively take nutrition. A plan should be developed that allows the parents to be comfortable with the physical and social aspects of nutrition. Options include tube feedings, allowing nippling as the infant desires, or no feedings.

<a id='877a2903-4723-4db8-bcce-2ee04d1b71ee'></a>

IX. **Siblings and Grandparents**

Siblings and grandparents are an important part of the family, however their needs and grief are often forgotten. Sometimes parents will ask for assistance in how to communicate with siblings or grandparents. Other times a parent's grief may prevent them from considering the grief of siblings. Siblings have reported that they have received less attention for their grief than have parents. The NICU has social workers, child life specialists, and the Pediatric Palliative Care Program that can assist parents with concerns regarding siblings and grandparents. Stanford Children's also has Bereavement Services that families can access after discharge or death of their infant (650-497-8175).

<a id='0d2e5719-c375-4c6c-8d6e-8d64b2c02479'></a>

X. **Location of Death**

Some parents would prefer the infant to die in the hospital and others that the infant die at home. Assuming the infant's condition allows for the family to reach home, either option is appropriate. Other families expect the infant to quickly die in the hospital, but when the infant survives longer, they wish to take the infant home. The case manager should be notified as soon as it becomes apparent that the family may wish to take the infant home. It can take some time to identify the services that are available in the infant's community. By notifying the case manager as soon as possible it helps prevent delays in discharging the infant home. A follow-up physician of record needs to be identified and the infant's condition, parental wishes, and plan of care discussed with the identified physician. The attending physician signs the Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST). The family is informed that this form prevents EMS from initiating life-sustaining measures and must be with the infant at all times. Many times, when the infant's death is imminent, families become frightened. This is when they should call their hospice provider, not 911, unless they want life-sustaining measures. A prescription for pain medication needs to be completed. Many of the medications given sublingually are actually IV formulations. Arrangements with inpatient pharmacy may need to be made to provide IV formulation to an outpatient pharmacy.

XI. **Comfort Care of the Infant on The Postpartum Unit**

Some families have decided on comfort care prior to birth. Other families make this decision while the mother remains hospitalized. Comfort care will be provided in the postpartum unit if this is the parents' wish. The

70 Part I-C: Delivery and Admission
NICU medical and nursing teams will care for the infant receiving comfort care in the postpartum unit. If the infant does not die prior to the mother's discharge, the parents, along with the medical team, will decide if the infant will remain hospitalized or if arrangements will be made for discharge home with the parents.

<a id='5f714022-2378-4926-bac5-5e0f35e59d0c'></a>

XII. **Pediatric Palliative Care Program**

For the majority of NICU infants who die, the NICU multidisciplinary team is able to skillfully assist these infants and their families. For infants who are discharged to home or to George Mark or another institution with a plan for palliative care, a consultation with the Pediatric Palliative Care Program should be initiated.

<a id='96d997fe-c7b4-4f3b-a2a6-d2bc4f4009ab'></a>

The goal of the Pediatric Palliative Care Program is to plan and provide comprehensive care for children living with a debilitating chronic or life-threatening condition, optimizing their quality of life as well as that of their families. The focus is on physical, psychological, social, and spiritual care throughout the illness trajectory, and in bereavement as appropriate. Palliative Care consultations are optimally initiated shortly after diagnosis and well in advance of the child's end-of-life. Usually it is appropriate to make a referral to the Pediatric Palliative Care Program when an infant will be discharged home with a life-threatening condition. While primary care professionals or family members may request a consultation, the attending physician is always informed prior to any involvement on the part of the Palliative Care Team. The multidisciplinary team includes professionals from medicine (critical care, pain management/symptom control), nursing, psychology/psychiatry, social work, chaplaincy, child life, education and rehabilitation.

## XIII. Social Work
When the death of an infant is anticipated, notify the social worker assigned to the infant. If a death occurs after hours, the on-call social worker can be paged. The Social Worker is a strong support system for the family and is an important link between the medical team and the family. They are able to help the family obtain the information they need and assist with bereavement and funeral arrangements.

## XIV. Nursing
The Bedside Nurse is an integral part of support for the family and should be included in family conferences whenever possible. It is essential that the plan of care the Medical Team develops with the parents be communicated to the nursing staff caring for the infant. The nurse can make mementos for the parents, which may include pictures of the infant, family members, handprints, footprints, memory boxes, and baptismal gowns.

## XV. Family Room
The NICU has a room available where the family can spend private, quiet time with their infant. They are allowed to stay for as long as needed.

## XVI. Chaplain
A chaplain is available 24 hours a day for support, comfort, baptisms, and blessings. They are available by calling 497-8538 or paging #2PRAY (27729) during the daytime hours and #1LOVE (15683) after 5 pm and on weekends.

**XVII. Pronouncing Death**

<a id='24c05edd-2b09-44b0-8179-c0618dd79ad0'></a>

A physician or nurse practitioner with a California license is called to pronounce the time of death. When no heart rate or respiratory effort is present, the time of death is pronounced. A death note should be written in the medical record stating the time of death and any other pertinent information, such as if the parents were notified or present and if an autopsy will be performed.

<a id='5c6611ce-639e-4293-bccc-85996dd2b764'></a>

XVIII. **Paperwork**

A. Death paperwork is completed using the ADT navigator and selecting "Discharge as deceased." The death certificate worksheet will be completed electronically and routed to the HIM office.

B. The MD is responsible for the following:

1. Calling the Coroner, if it is a coroner's case (review the checklist on the back of the Death Certificate Worksheet), immediately after death. The Santa Clara County Coroner's number is 408-793-1900. Record the reference number and complete the disclosure form if the Coroner is contacted.

2. Calling the California Transplant Donor Network (CTDN) at 800-553-6667 to inform of all deaths of live- borns with an APGAR >0. Ideally, the first call is made to CTDN when discussions about transition of care are initiated. At minimum, a phone call must be placed **within 1 hour of death**. Remember to obtain the release number and complete the disclosure form if the CTDN is contacted. If a patient is being transitioned to comfort care and/or is expected to expire, call CTDN at earliest possible time, even prior to death, so that plans can be made should the patient be a potential donor.

3. If autopsy is to be performed, complete the "Consent for Autopsy" form, signed by the next of kin, and witnessed. Hospital policy requires that we request permission for autopsy, but the decision is up to the parents. It is best to complete this process in person, as telephone consents are complex.

4. Complete the "Death Certificate Worksheet". All questions should be answered with no blanks left. The Nursing Supervisor can be contacted to help at x78430/pager# 18672. The legal Death Certificate is prepared from the worksheet and MUST BE SIGNED within 15 hours of death. If the death occurs overnight and the Fellow who is post-call has left for the day, the Attending may sign the certificate. If available when filling out the paperwork, use the name that will appear on the infant's birth certificate so that both birth and death certificate names match. If not available, use the NICU name, medical record number, and date of birth.

5. Once completed, the front desk will submit all of the paperwork to the Nursing Supervisor, who will take the information to HIMS and/or Autopsy Department if one was requested.

6. The MD should prepare a Death Summary in Epic called "IP Discharge Summary" (Death Note). All problems should be reviewed and updated prior to generating the note.

XIX. **Helpful Hints in Determining the Cause of Death**

A. The immediate cause of death is the disease, abnormality or injury that led directly to the death. In many instances, the immediate cause of death is also the underlying cause of death. The underlying cause of death must have an etiologic or pathologic relationship to the cause of death. It can also be an antecedent condition that prepared the way for the subsequent cause. It must have initiated the lethal chain of events no matter how long the time interval. The time intervals between causes must be listed in chronological

order and must be supported by etiological sequence. [e.g., unacceptable would be: cardiac arrest, septic shock, virus; acceptable would be: anoxia, cerebral encephalopathy, chicken pox). The cause of death cannot be "death itself" as suggested by phrases such as "cardiac arrest," "respiratory arrest," "brain death,".

B. The underlying causes must have a plausible causal relationship to the next-higher item on the list of causes (for example, prematurity wouldn't generally be considered a cause of leukemia).

C. The initial condition that starts the sequence on the form must be specific so that it does not leave any doubt as to why it developed (e.g., sepsis is not considered specific because a number of conditions may have resulted in sepsis).

D. If prematurity is specified as a cause, the Medical Examiner may request clarity as to whether or not it was due to trauma (e.g., "prematurity, not traumatic").

XX. **Stillbirth vs. Baby Born Alive**

A. Stillborn Infants

1. Stillborn infants are infants who are born with no signs of life. For stillborn infants born after 20 weeks' gestation the obstetrical staff completes the Certificate of Stillbirth, notification of the Santa Clara County coroner, and documentation of the stillbirth in the maternal chart. No birth certificate is generated.

2. If documentation by the peds team on delivery room activities related to a stillborn infant (fetal demise) is required, an event note should be documented in the maternal chart.

B. Infants born alive

1. Any baby who is born with signs of life (a heart rate or any spontaneous breathing movement, including breathing effort) is a "baby born alive." The obstetric team will call the NICU team if there is a question of the fetus being born alive. If there are no signs of life, then the delivery is considered stillborn and the obstetric team handles the paperwork as described above. If the infant shows any signs of life, the documentation includes the following:

a. Completion of the Birth Certificate by the Birth Recorder

b. Creation of a medical record by Admitting

c. Entering of admission orders. Use the order set called Neonatal Comfort Care Supplemental Orders.

The infant is admitted to the NICU, even if the infant does not physically move to the NICU.

d. Documentation of a medical evaluation in an Admission Note (see template below)

e. Completion of initial nursing assessment by RN

2. Extremely premature infants (<24 weeks estimated gestational age) - management may consist of:

a. Attempted resuscitation and/or stabilization for initiation of intensive care, if requested by the parents

i. Resuscitation and stabilization of infants < 23 weeks' gestation or < 500 grams will generally be reserved for very unusual circumstances; it is essential for parents to be aware that such efforts are rarely successful.

b. Evaluation to confirm that the infant is extremely premature and therefore unlikely to benefit from medical interventions, followed by provision of comfort care measures.
c. Documentation includes:
   i. An admission evaluation, confirming the estimated gestational age (see template below)
   ii. A written medical assessment that intensive care measures will not be beneficial and are not indicated (see template below)
   iii. Neonatal Comfort Care Supplemental Orders.

3. If there has been an antepartum decision not to initiate intensive care, based on the estimated gestational age or prenatal diagnosis of congenital anomaly or disease, made after discussion with the parents, management may consist of:
   a. Evaluation to confirm the findings that form the basis for the decision to limit interventions, followed by the provision of comfort measures
   b. Attendance of the birth by a minimal pediatric team and respect for the parents' wishes for privacy and for time alone with their infant.
   c. Documentation includes:
      i. An admission note confirming the findings that provided the basis for the decision not to intervene with intensive care measures and the medical assessment that intensive care measures will not be beneficial and are not indicated.
      ii. Neonatal Comfort Care Supplementation Orders.

4. If an infant is born alive and expires in the delivery room, the pediatric team completes the following:
   a. A Draft Death Certificate and subsequently a Death Certificate. If "extreme prematurity" is listed as the cause of death, be sure to specify whether this was the result of trauma (i.e., use "extreme prematurity, not traumatic")
   b. Notify the Santa Clara County Coroner of the infant's demise. (Expect the coroner's investigator to ask if the cause of death was trauma or drug or alcohol abuse)
   c. Notify the California Transport Donor Network of the infant's demise.
   d. Complete a discharge summary. See template below for extremely immature infants (<24 weeks gestation)

5. If an infant who is expected to expire in the delivery room remains alive.
   a. The infant can be taken to the mother's room on Maternity or to the NICU for ongoing comfort care per parental wishes.
   b. The infant remains the responsibility of the NICU medical and nursing teams.
   c. Documentation should be completed as described in Section XIX.B.3. If the infant survives through

# I. Introduction

Newborn infants typically lose up to 10% of their body weight over the first 7-14 days of life. Premature babies have higher total body water content and an excess of extracellular water resulting in more weight loss than term infants. While a healthy term infant should demonstrate a real gain (not just edema) over birth weight by 2 weeks of age, many premature infants will still be below birth weight at that time.

At birth, neonates are fluid overloaded and need to diurese and lose weight. Though they don't need water initially, they need some fluid as a vehicle to provide the rest of their maintenance requirements (e.g., glucose, amino acids, calcium). Too much fluid and sodium initially delays diuresis, resulting in increased residual lung fluid, worse lung disease, and a greater risk of persistent ductal patency.

Extra-uterine growth restriction is an ongoing issue in the NICU. Neonates, particularly premature ones, whose nutritional needs are not met for a significant length of time, rapidly fall off their optimal growth curve. Even a short period without appropriate nutrition can result in protein, calcium, or phosphorus deficiencies that can be difficult to correct.

<a id='996c72e7-e03e-4fa8-ba8b-ca0405139aaa'></a>

II. **Rationale for Fluid Management**

A. **Very Low Birth Weight (VLBW) Infants (<1500 gm)**: Infants have increased fluid needs due to a variety of factors:

1.  Immature skin integrity results in increased transcutaneous water losses.
2.  Kidneys have decreased ability to concentrate urine.
3.  Capillaries are more prone to leak fluid, resulting in extravascular edema.
4.  Both skin integrity and renal concentrating ability improve significantly over the first week of life.

B. **Micro-preemies (< 28 weeks or 1000 gm)**: These infants may need 200 mL/kg/day or more of IVF in first week because of increased transdermal losses or very immature renal function.

1.  Indications for increasing fluids include weight loss >15% of birth weight, urine output >6 mL/kg/hr, serum sodium >150 mg/dL, and BUN >40.
2.  Babies <28 weeks should be in a humidified isolette after initial stabilization. Humidity is routinely started at 75% for infants <28 weeks and 80% for infants <26 weeks. Humidity may be increased to 85% to maintain thermal stability or as needed to manage fluid and electrolyte imbalances.
3.  Electrolytes, calcium, and hematocrit should be checked every 12 hours if the patient demonstrates instability. Urine output must be followed; >5 mL/kg/hr is a clue that the patient has unstable kidney function. At least twice a day, the micro-preemie's total fluid rate needs to be assessed against laboratory data, weight changes, and total urine output. If the total fluid rate is less than the urine output, this is a problem, especially if supported by weight drop and increasing sodium values. Micro-preemies can lose 25-100 mL/kg/day just through the skin!

C. **Both term and pre-term infants with capillary leak problems** (e.g., associated with asphyxia, septic

shock, etc) are best managed by providing a relatively restricted baseline crystalloid infusion and
supplementing with "bolus" infusions of crystalloid or colloid.

<a id='33c4ad35-4cbb-4487-b929-e89943dc4ed7'></a>

D. The goal of IV fluid therapy during the first few days of life is to:

1. Prevent excessive weight loss and dehydration, which can result in hypotension, cell damage, hyperkalemia, and IVH.
2. Allow the premature infant to lose 1-2% body weight per day, not to exceed a total of 15% over the first 7-10 days of life.
3. Provide adequate glucose and amino acid delivery.
4. Meet electrolyte needs.
5. Keep indwelling catheters patent.
6. Avoid fluid overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema, PDA, and an increased incidence of Chronic Lung Disease.

<a id='7882d3d0-1690-4452-b294-e8ab79ec9d3a'></a>

E. **Typical fluid volume (mL/kg/day)**: This will vary with the gestational age and diagnosis of the infant.
Some guidelines are as follows:

1. >1500 gm: 60-80 mL/kg/day
2. 1000-1500 gm: 80 mL/kg/day
3. <1000 gm: 80-100 mL/kg/day
4. Advance over next 5 days depending upon labs, weights, and urine output, generally by 10-20 mL/kg/d to reach 150-160 mL/kg/day.

<a id='abf4f236-7020-4694-bf18-c6122deabec9'></a>

F. **Adjustments in maintenance fluids** are needed as follows:

1.  **Increase** maintenance fluids for:
    1.  Excessive weight loss
    2.  Gastroschisis/omphalocele
    3.  Immature, sticky, translucent skin
    4.  Polyuria, hypernatremia, hyperkalemia

2.  **Decrease** maintenance fluids for:
    1.  Asphyxia/cerebral edema
    2.  Generalized body edema
    3.  Oliguria (e.g., renal failure, SIADH, indomethacin)
    4.  Heart failure or PDA

### III. Electrolyte Requirements

A. Hemodynamically stable term infants usually need no sodium or potassium during the first day of life. Total serum calcium levels are usually low due to hypoalbuminemia and rise with improved nutrition. Ionized calcium values (reported with ABGs) are more accurate, although alkalosis and heparin can result in falsely low measurements.

B. Patients with hypotension or cardiac disease, requiring blood product transfusion (calcium is bound by anticoagulants used by the blood bank), or with documented hypocalcemia (ionized calcium values <1.0) need to have IV calcium supplied. Central infusion is preferred since calcium burns can result in permanent scarring.

1. Calcium maintenance requirements are provided by calcium gluconate, 200-400 mg/kg/day, when calcium is needed. [See section IX below “Basic Calculations” for calculating calcium in maintenance fluids.]

2. When boluses are required for severe hypocalcemia (ionized levels <0.8) and poor cardiac function, calcium chloride (via a central line only) or calcium gluconate may be given.

3. Calcium is incompatible with many medications, especially bicarbonate; don't add calcium to any line unless you are sure it is compatible. Adding extra calcium to Parenteral Nutrition (PN) solutions (after pharmacy already prepared it) is dangerous and precipitation may occur based on the phosphorus concentration.

C. When the patient demonstrates a need for sodium, either by falling sodium levels or to support tissue growth, add sodium chloride 2-3 mEq/kg/day. When treating hyponatremia, it is important to remember volume expanders like FFP and 5% albumin contain nearly the same amount of sodium as normal saline and may contain as much as 175-180 mEq/liter. It seldom is necessary to give hypertonic IV boluses of sodium in the NICU. Hyponatremia during early life can be an indication of volume overload, and reduction in fluid delivery is the treatment of choice.

D. Potassium requirement is usually 2 mEq/kg/day initially, and is added when the patient demonstrates a need and normal renal function. We do not give boluses of potassium for mild hypokalemia (K+ level 2.9-3.5) unless patient is on digoxin. Adding more potassium chloride to the maintenance infusion should take care of the problem. If K+ level is <3, use the “IV Potassium Replacement” order set available in Epic.

<a id='05f9b609-1b6e-4095-bae2-a929a3c3015c'></a>

IV. __Glucose Requirements__

A. **Newborn infants** have a basal requirement of about 4-6 mg/kg/min of glucose.

B. **Healthy term infants** can meet this need through glycolysis and gluconeogenesis and do not necessarily need IV infusions.

C. **Pre-term infants and IUGR term infants** have decreased supply of substrate and decreased ability to utilize their stores.

80 Part II-A: Fluids and Nutrition

D. Infants of Diabetic Mothers (IDMs) are exposed to higher than normal glucose levels in utero that result in pancreatic islet-cell hyperplasia. Therefore, they may be relatively hyperinsulinemic at birth, resulting in higher than normal glucose requirements and hypoglycemia.

E. Typical IV infusion is dextrose 10% in water (D10W) which contains 10 gm of dextrose monohydrate, the equivalent of 9.1 gm of glucose, per 100 mL. The 60 mL/kg/day minimum rate was chosen since this provides about 3.8 mg/kg/min of glucose, roughly the minimum glucose requirement. ELBW infants less than 1000 gm at birth may have impaired glucose tolerance leading to hyperglycemia, so are generally started on an IV solution containing D5W rather than D10W. We may infuse concentrations between D3W and D12.5W through a peripheral IV. Higher concentrations require central access.

F. Hypoglycemia

1. Initial levels are checked by a glucometer. Levels <40 need to be verified by a serum glucose determination (sent to lab). Glucose concentration in whole blood (glucometer) is approximately 10-15% lower than in serum (lab).
2. Blood for glucose levels needs to be checked via heel-stick, venipuncture or drawn through an indwelling catheter that is NOT being used to infuse glucose (it's impossible to "clear" a line infusing glucose).
3. IV dextrose concentration and delivery rate should be adjusted to keep the glucose level >40 and <150.
4. After an intervention for hypoglycemia repeat glucose determinations should be done every 30 min until stable levels are confirmed.
5. IV dextrose is the appropriate therapy for levels <25 mg/dL regardless of gestational age or symptoms.
6. Know the glucose delivery being supplied to any patient. For example, a patient on D12.5W at 80 mL/kg/day receives 6.3 mg/kg/min of glucose. (See Section IX below "Basic Calculations").
7. Hypoglycemia is treated with IV pushes of dextrose (2 mL/kg of D10W). All IV boluses must be accompanied by increases in the maintenance glucose delivery rate and a glucose level should be rechecked within 30 min following an intervention.
8. For persistent hypoglycemia, please see Section II:H.2 "Hypoglycemia".

<a id='948adebe-6fd6-4d1d-ad9d-53e20c64b074'></a>

V. **Parenteral Nutrition (PN)**

A. **Goals**

The goals of PN are to meet the patient's fluid, calorie, fat, protein, electrolyte, vitamin, and trace element maintenance needs, initially to prevent deficits, then to advance to levels needed for appropriate growth and development.

B. **Calories**

Most of the calories to support growth, generally around 60%, should come from dextrose monohydrate (3.4 kcal/gm), with the remainder from lipids. Protein will hopefully be incorporated in new tissue and not be burned as energy.

1. Maintenance: 60-80 kcal/kg/day

<a id='8630ea7b-0d74-4214-8ee6-dc06e292dcdb'></a>

C. Protein

Babies need protein initially to prevent tissue break-down (catabolism), and then for new tissue growth. TrophAmine® is the preferred Amino Acid (AA) solution in the LPCH NICU secondary to improved nitrogen retention, plasma amino acid patterns comparable to breast fed infants, and decreased cholestasis compared to standard amino acid solutions. Special situations (e.g., renal failure, metabolic disease) may require a different solution.

<a id='343ebf49-3228-4bdd-8751-d9f131fb2df6'></a>

1. Initial

The neonate loses about 1.2 gm of protein/kg/day if not supplemented. All infants should be started on at least 3 gm of protein/kg/day (or maximum achievable per fluid restriction) in the form of amino acids beginning as soon as possible after birth even if adequate calorie intake is not able to be infused. In VLBW infants, early initiation of amino acids leads to decreased catabolism, positive nitrogen balance, better glucose tolerance via increased insulin levels, and improved growth. See next Section VIII. "Ordering Parenteral Nutrition" for how to order initial, "starter" or "Vanilla" TPN containing appropriate amino acids for VLBW infants.

<a id='cf583513-ff92-4be8-a408-fe396c271813'></a>

## 2. Growth

Amino acids can gradually be increased until 3.5 gm/kg/day is reached for term infants and increased to 4 gm/kg/day for pre-term infants, or as indicated. Serum albumin levels should be followed to confirm adequate protein levels. BUN levels are not very helpful in assessing protein status in the first few days of life due to changes in renal function and fluid status. Once these are stable, elevations in BUN may indicate a need to decrease amino acids.

<a id='a8ed2999-0cbd-4bc0-863c-711eaf702f8e'></a>

D. Lipid

Fats are needed to meet essential fatty acid requirements (~0.5 gm/kg/day of intravenous fat) for cell membrane, myelination, skin formation, and hormone production. Additional lipids are supplied to achieve overall caloric delivery necessary for growth. Rapid infusion of lipids may induce increased pulmonary vascular resistance, so this is infused over 24 hrs, and the advance may be slowed in babies with severe respiratory failure. Additionally, free fatty acids can interfere with bilirubin-albumin binding. As long as the fatty acid/albumin ratio is low, this is not a problem. Thus, triglyceride (TG) levels must be monitored while on IV lipids, particularly in jaundiced babies.

1. Initial

Most neonates will tolerate 1.2 gm of protein/kg/day if not supplemented. All infants should be started on at least 3 gm of protein/kg/day (or maximum achievable per fluid restriction) in the form of amino acids beginning as soon as possible after birth even if adequate calorie intake is not able to be infused. In VLBW infants, early initiation of amino acids leads to decreased catabolism, positive nitrogen balance, better glucose tolerance via increased insulin levels, and improved growth. See next Section VIII. "Ordering Parenteral Nutrition" for how to order initial, "starter" or "vanilla" TPN containing appropriate amino acids for VLBW infants.

Lipids can be advanced by 0.5-1 gm/kg daily up to a maximum of 3 gm/kg/day. For ELBW infants, lipids are usually held at 1-1.5 gm/kg/day for the first week until greater metabolic stability and after the peak of hyperbilirubinemia. TG levels are monitored daily while advancing the dose, then 1-2 times per week once on full lipids. The lipid infusion rate should be cut in half for levels > 250 mg/dL, and lipid infusion should be stopped until normalization of TG level if TG > 400 mg/dL. Patients with persistent TG levels > 250 mg/dL may receive 0.5-1 gm/kg of lipids 2 times per week to prevent essential fatty acid deficiency. L-Carnitine (5 mg/kg/day) added to PN may enhance fat clearance in patients with persistently high TG levels. Lipids may also need to be restricted to 1 gm/kg/day for elevated direct bilirubin levels.

VI. **Ordering Parenteral Nutrition**

A. PN must be ordered daily and custom-formulated for each patient. The custom program is accessible via the "Web Resources" tab in Epic via the "Infusion Studio Link". You will have to specify all of the details described below. This program allows you to see the previous day's order, which you can modify and update. For patients tolerating stable maintenance parenteral nutrition, you can review the previous order and re-order it without change if appropriate. The paragraphs below are also summarized succinctly in Table 1 at the end of this chapter.

B. Neonatal vs. Premie Day1 Protocol. Premie Day1 Protocol is used to write the initial, "starter" or "Vanilla" ("plain vanilla" with only dextrose and amino acids) PN for VLBW (<1500 grams at birth) infants. This protocol alerts the Pharmacy that this bag of PN should be made and sent to the NICU immediately rather than batching the order. During off hours between 6 pm and 8 am, the Pharmacy should also be called to alert them to a Vanilla TPN order. For the next and all future bags of PN, the protocol should be changed back to Neonatal. Please see Appendix 1 below for detailed instructions on ordering Vanilla TPN.

C. Central vs. Peripheral. Catheters ending in a large vessel (inferior/superior vena cava or aorta) are considered central regardless of type (Broviac, Cook, UAC, UVC, mini silastic "PICC" line). Please check catheter placement and verify with your attending that the line can be considered "central". The differentiation is important, since the concentrations of various key elements of parenteral nutrition (e.g., dextrose, calcium) that can be infused safely are greater in central vs. peripheral vessels. By indicating the catheter site, the Pharmacy can help assure that safe concentration limits are NOT exceeded.

D. Fluid Volume. By indicating what other IV fluids are running, the Pharmacy can adjust the Parenteral Nutrition accordingly to avoid fluid overload. List all other drips (e.g., fentanyl, dopamine, midazolam) as well as other fluid infusions used to keep lines open (e.g. peripheral arterial line, CVP line). Sodium chloride (i.e., 1/2 NS or NS) should be listed, especially with small preemies, as the NaCl delivery from a peripheral arterial line can be significant: 1/2 NS @ 1 mL/hr in a 500 gram baby gives 3.7 mEq/kg/day NaCl.

E. Enteral Feeds. If the infant on PN is feeding and the feeding volume is included in the total fluid intake, the Pharmacy subtracts the feeding volume, then prepares the PN, concentrating additives into the reduced PN volume. If the feeding volume is NOT included on the PN order, PN will be created assuming patient is NPO. You must be careful to watch and wean electrolytes when feeds are included in total fluids. The sodium and potassium supplements in the PN may impact the serum values once the baby comes off PN (i.e. he/she may become hyponatremic or hypokalemic) since the PN is corrected only for the volume, not the content, of the feedings. Thus, for patients whose feedings are changing or at high risk for feeding intolerance, it may be better not to include the feeds in the daily PN order.

F. Dextrose. The goal is to provide about 60% of total calories as carbohydrate, which provides 3.4 kcal/g of dextrose monohydrate. Initial dextrose concentration is usually D10; this provides about 3.8 mg/kg/min of

<a id='22f4d6d6-8abc-4a49-a785-98ab45dcc0b2'></a>

Management of IV Fluids and TPN 83
glucose at 60 mL/kg/day, and 5.1 mg/kg/min at 80 mL/kg/day. Dextrose concentration is increased 10-20% a day (e.g. from D10 to D11 or D12) to keep serum glucose levels 50-150 until the carbohydrate goal of 70% of total calories is met. Typical maximum concentration via central line is D20. Although most patients will not need this high a concentration, those with fluid restriction or high caloric needs may need more (up to D30). Maximum dextrose concentration through a peripheral IV is D12.5, which is adequate for the vast majority of our patients. Keep in mind that too much dextrose is a bad thing - it leads to increased CO2 production, may worsen respiratory acidosis, and contributes to fatty liver. Most texts recommend a target dextrose delivery of 9-12.5 mg/kg/min, or 13-18 g/kg/day. We recommend not exceeding a total of ~12.5 mg/kg/min, or ~18 g/kg/day of parenteral carbohydrate intake because of these concerns.

<a id='4edd45c9-8f6d-4618-907d-a6dbf6d67caa'></a>

G. **Lipids.** IntraLipid® 20% (IL-20) is used in the LPCH NICU. It is ordered in g/kg daily. IL-20 provides 0.2 g/mL of lipid, and 2 kcal/mL (9 kcal/g of lipid, and an additional 0.2 kcal/mL from glycerol). Thus, 0.1 mL/kg/hr delivers about 0.5 g/kg/day; 15 mL/kg/day delivers 3 g/kg/day, and 30 kcal/kg/day. Remember to wean the IL-20 as feedings advance, since fats make up most of the caloric content of milk. Once feedings of ≥ 80 mL/kg/d are achieved, the IL-20 rate should be restricted to 1 g/kg/day, and IL-20 may be stopped when feedings are ≥ 100-120 mL/kg/d.

H. **Protein.** Patients should be started on TrophAmine® of 2-3 g/kg/day (or maximum achievable in VLBW infants), with increases of 0.5-1 g/kg/day to a goal of 3-4 g/kg/day. Adjustments may need to be made for liver or renal dysfunction.

I. **Trace elements.** 0.2 mL/kg of Pediatric Trace Element Solution (PTES) is the usual dose. For patients with a direct bilirubin greater than 2 mg/dL, we discontinue this additive because of impaired hepatic excretion. (See section V. W. below "PN Cholestasis.")

J. **Zinc.** Preemies need 400 mcg/kg/day of Zinc in PN. Term infants need a total of 250 mcg/kg/day. (see section IV. W. below "PN Cholestasis")

K. **Vitamins.** For our preemie population (weight <2.5 kg) 2 mL/kg/day of Pediatric MVI is given to supply vitamins (e.g., A, E, D, K) plus folate. Larger infants receive 5 mL/day.

L. **Sodium.** Usual maintenance is 3 mEq/kg/day. VLBW infants do not usually need this during the first few days of life as their total body sodium (and water) levels are usually high, and they need to diurese. Growing preemies commonly require more. Patients on diuretics will have lower sodium values. Do not push to have "normal" Na levels in patients on diuretics (that is how diuretics work). A serum sodium value in the low 130s is probably optimal for a patient on diuretics.

M. **Potassium.** Usual maintenance is 2 mEq/kg/day. Potassium is difficult to measure in patients without central lines. Heel-stick K+ values may be falsely elevated. Reported K+ values >7 always need to be rechecked, and values >6 need to be rechecked in patients receiving IV KCl or with renal impairment. We will preferentially increase KCl infusions in hypochloremic patients as it is better tolerated than increased NaCl or arginine chloride infusions. Since K and Cl are intracellular ions, hypochloremia usually reflects intracellular and total body K depletion. Increased amounts of potassium are required in patients receiving diuretics, especially if evidence of metabolic alkalosis is present

N. **Acetate/chloride.** Cations (Na, K) are balanced with either acetate or chloride anions. Acetate is a good source of base for infants with low serum bicarbonate, as we cannot give bicarbonate in PN (it would precipitate out with calcium). Most of the time we include relatively balanced acetate/chloride numbers. For example, a patient receiving 4 mEq of Na and 4 mEq of K will need about 8 mEq of anion. With the PN computer program, one must write in the amount of acetate desired and the remainder is calculated as chloride. In patients with hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis from chronic diuretic use, we must put "minimum" acetate in the PN. The computer program will prompt you as to what the minimum for that patient is. Keep in mind that hypochloremia usually indicates a potassium deficit, so in addition to

84 Part II-A: Fluids and Nutrition
minimizing acetate, increasing the potassium in the PN will also help. In patients with chronic metabolic acidosis (i.e., renal tubular acidosis of prematurity) and low serum bicarbonate values (<17), we may give "maximum" acetate. Be careful not to let the serum bicarbonate values get too high (>30) as alkalotic patients may not respond to hypercapnia well and may be difficult to extubate. In a patient with normal serum bicarbonate (19-24), an initial acetate dose of 3 mEq/kg/day is typical. Also, remember that almost 1 mEq of acetate is provided by each gram of TrophAmine.

O. **Magnesium.** Maintenance magnesium (Mg) of 0.2-0.3 mEq/kg/day is usually ordered unless a patient has an abnormal level. Neonates that are initially hypermagnesemic secondary to maternal magnesium administration usually need no magnesium until serum levels normalize.

P. **Calcium/Phosphorus.** Both elements are vital to bone deposition. The body will compensate for hypocalcemia by reabsorbing newly deposited bone, so it is important to give sufficient calcium and phosphorus in the correct ratio (1.3-1.7 mg Ca to 1 mg P) to have net bone production. We aim to provide calcium gluconate of about 400 mg/kg/day and phosphorus of 1 mMol/kg/day. VLBW infants may need 500 mg/kg/day of calcium gluconate. Growing preemies will rarely be hypophosphatemic or hypocalcemic even while developing osteopenia, since bone serves as a great reservoir.

Q. **Heparin.** Total heparin delivery should not exceed 5 units/kg/hr.
   1. **PIV** (peripheral IV): no heparin.
   2. **Arterial Lines** (i.e., UAC, PAL): 1 unit heparin/mL
   3. **Central Venous Lines** (i.e., UVC, PICC, Hickman/Broviac): 0.5 unit heparin/mL. Make sure to add TKO fluids with heparin (0.5 units/mL) to second lumen to prevent clotting if not able to TPN infuse through second lumen.

R. **Ranitidine.** Ranitidine should NOT be ordered routinely for stress ulcer prophylaxis for patients on PN, as the premature stomach is a poor acid producer. Ranitidine use has been associated with NEC, and acidification of feeds has been suggested as a means of preventing NEC. Ranitidine use should be reserved for patients with coagulopathy, gastritis, documented GE reflux, and those on steroids. Ranitidine can be added to PN at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day.

S. **Selenium.** After an infant has been on PN for 1 month, selenium should be added to the daily PN solution in the amount of 2 micrograms/kg/day and a baseline selenium level should be checked. Levels should be checked monthly while on selenium.

T. **Copper.** The dose is 20 mcg/kg/day. If direct bilirubin levels are >2, then decrease dose to 10 mcg/kg/day. Check levels every month.

U. **PN Labs.** Order the "Clinical Pathway for TPN" in Epic. After 1 month of PN, zinc, copper, and selenium levels should be followed.

V. **Carnitine.** Should be added in cases of very high serum triglyceride levels, as it helps process lipids as a transport mechanism inside cells. The dose is 3-5 mg/kg/day.

W. **PN Cholestasis.** In patients with PN cholestasis (conjugated bilirubin ≥ 2), if the Pediatric Trace Element Solution is included in the PN, remove it because copper and manganese are excreted through the bile and will build up in tissue, especially the liver, causing hepatic toxicity. Infants with PN cholestasis who are on enteral feedings are generally started on Ursodiol (10 mg/kg q8hr) if direct bilirubin levels are >2. Also see Section II:F.4. "Neonatal Cholestasis" for more detail.

VII. **Important Notes Regarding PN**

A. Initiation of PN is recommended immediately on admission of VLBW infants unless significant fluid shifts or metabolic derangements are present.

B. PN rate should never be increased to make-up additional fluid requirements unless PN has specifically been written for this purpose.

C. Central PN should never be run in a peripheral line (even if calcium and dextrose concentration look okay) unless specifically cleared by pharmacy, due to possible osmolality differences.

D. The UAC catheter is used as a non-contaminated site for lab sampling. Standard solution is 1/2 NS with 1 unit heparin/mL at 0.5 - 1 mL/hr. If no other central access is available, PN or other IVFs may be run through the UAC.

<a id='c5da90b4-2c88-4ca9-894a-fcef3ecd64d2'></a>

VIII. **Peripheral vs. Central Line Concentration Limits**

There are both solubility and osmolality limits to what can be placed in parenteral solutions. The "TPN" program will alert you if you go over these. Sometimes you may be paged by the PN Pharmacy if there are problems.

A. **Amino Acids**

1. **Peripheral IV**: 2% of PN volume
2. **Central IV**: 3% of PN volume

B. **Dextrose**

1. **Peripheral IV**: 12.5%
2. **Central IV**: 30%

C. **Potassium**

1. **Peripheral IV**: 60 mEq/L
2. **Central IV**: 120 mEq/L

D. **Calcium Gluconate**

1. **Peripheral IV**: maximum 3 g/L in PN, consider lower concentration in PN if serum calcium levels normal, otherwise no calcium in peripheral line due to severity of calcium infiltrate burns
2. **Central IV**: 8 g/L or as per calcium/phosphate solubility curves

<a id='68faff71-61c9-4d8b-af08-4f6376643833'></a>

IX. **Basic Calculations**

A. **Glucose Delivery**: Calculating glucose delivery or Glucose Infusion Rate (GIR) requires converting grams of dextrose monohydrate to the equivalent in anhydrous glucose with the correction factor (180/198, reduced to 10/11), based upon their molecular weights.

1.  GIR mg/kg/min = (D%)(10/11)(# mL/kg/day)(1/144). Example –

<a id='91fe1eb4-2e48-47ee-92fe-e01da1bd314e'></a>

86 Part II-A: Fluids and Nutrition
D12.5% @ 80 mL/kg/day= (12.5)(10/11)(80)(1/144) = 6.3 mg/kg/min

i. Most neonates require 4-8 mg/kg/min initially.
ii. Advance by 1-2.5 mg/kg/min daily as tolerated
iii. Target is 10-12 mg/kg/min.

2. **GIR g/kg/day = (D%)(10/11)(# mL/kg/day)(1/100)**. Example --
D12.5% @ 120 mL/kg/day = (12.5)(10/11)(120)(1/100) = 13.6 g/kg/day

i. Most neonates need 13-18 g/kg/day; avoid >18 g/kg/day.

3. To convert mg/kg/min to g/kg/day, multiply by 1.44. To convert g/kg/day to mg/kg/min, multiply by 0.694.

<a id='945bca8f-bbfb-4a6f-bf11-32d10977e50a'></a>

B. **Calories Provided**: Calories from PN can be calculated from the amounts of fats and carbohydrates given. (NOTE: Patients should not be using supplied protein for caloric needs unless malnourished. Protein contains roughly 16% nitrogen by weight).

1.  **Carbohydrate** – calculate either from dextrose monohydrate concentration (3.4 kcal/g), or from GIR (3.8 kcal/g): Dextrose: (D%)(# mL/kg/day)(3.4 kcal/g)(1/100) = kcal/kg/day, or,
    i. GIR: (Glucose gm/kg/day)(3.8 kcal/gm) = kcal/kg/day, or,
    ii. GIR: (Glucose mg/kg/min)(1.44)(3.8 kcal/g) = kcal/kg/day.
2.  **Lipids** – calculate either from:
    i. g/kg/day: (g/kg/day)(10 kcal/gm), e.g., 3 g/kg/day = (3)(10) = 30 kcal/kg/day, or
    ii. mL/kg/day: (mL/kg/day)(2 kcal/mL), e.g., 15 mL/kg/day = (15)(2) = 30 kcal/kg/day.
3.  **Protein** – Kcal/kg = (g amino acid/kg/day)(4 kcal/g), e.g., 3 g/kg/day, thus (3)(4) = 12 kcal/kg/day.

<a id='953300ff-04ac-4c01-a1a3-bc6260edce31'></a>

**C. Calcium Calculations:**

Calcium gluconate mg per 250 mL bag = (mg calcium/kg/day)/(mL/kg/day total fluids) x 250

1.  Remember **maximum safe concentrations** -- calcium IV infiltrates can cause severe injury resulting in skin grafts, even tendon damage.
    i.  **Central**: 8 g/L = 800 mg/100 mL
    ii. **Peripheral**: 3 g/L = 300 mg/100 mL
