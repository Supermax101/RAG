# Executive Summary

<a id='5b71587c-349e-4011-9911-07f739376603'></a>

Traditional perinatal care continues to face challenges
as a result of low precision, conflicting data, and
varying clinical practice that often lacks
standardization

<a id='c87029ee-da70-49a3-9458-fdda7f68efa5'></a>

Neonatal recommendations are often based on **weak evidence** extrapolated from studies in animals, older children, and adults

<a id='dbed3974-b545-4c15-8a6c-b862d8bdc2cc'></a>

Medical advancements have allowed for delivery of an increasingly
**fragile** population (e.g., extremely premature infants, rare congenital
conditions)

<a id='598d4c6f-6a7b-4791-b7ce-b576c3532d63'></a>

Inability to predict and prevent **complications** has led to **increased costs** and **morbidity**

<a id='af256c43-62d1-4f9e-99fe-e534d5ce4474'></a>

Treatment approaches are often dependent on a mix of stakeholders (e.g., nutrition strategies), yielding **high variability in quality of care**

<a id='189fe85e-e79f-4e29-ac66-232fae5f18a6'></a>

<::flowchart
: This flowchart illustrates the process of Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) management, highlighting potential issues and feedback loops. The process flows in a clockwise direction, starting from patient evaluation.

**Main Cycle:**
1.  **Patient evaluation** (history, labs, meds, etc.): This step takes approximately "30 min". An icon of a patient in a bed with a heart monitor is associated with this step.
2.  **Multidisciplinary team discussion** (MD/APP, PharmD, RD, RN): This step takes "20-60 min". An icon of three people with a lightbulb above them represents this discussion.
3.  **TPN Ordering**: This step takes "10-20 min". An icon of a laptop is associated with this step.
4.  **TPN Verification & Order Transcription**: This step takes "15-60 min". An icon of a document with lines and a checkmark is associated with this step.
5.  **TPN Preparation** (Sterile Compounding): This step takes "15-60 min". An icon of a syringe is associated with this step.
6.  **TPN Administration** (line change, set up, etc.): This step takes "10-20 min". An icon of an IV bag is associated with this step.

**Feedback Loops and Issues:**
*   From "TPN Verification & Order Transcription", an arrow labeled "Order issue" (with a 'no entry' sign) points back to "TPN Ordering" via a path labeled "Re-entry".
*   From "TPN Ordering", an arrow labeled "Clarification" points back to "Multidisciplinary team discussion".
*   From "TPN Administration", an arrow points to a text box stating "Order changes after compounding result in excess waste", which is accompanied by an icon of a rising line graph.

<::The image displays five separate scatter plots, arranged horizontally, each representing a different group (Group 1 to Group 5). Each plot compares 'Newborn NEC Probability' on the y-axis for two categories on the x-axis: 'Prescribed' and 'TPN3.0 for NEC'. Points are connected by thin gray lines, indicating a paired comparison or change. The points for 'Prescribed' are generally higher in probability and darker blue, while points for 'TPN3.0 for NEC' are generally lower and lighter blue. 

**Group 1:**
- **Y-axis:** Newborn NEC Probability, ranging from 0.0 to 0.3.
- **Data:** 'Prescribed' probabilities range from approximately 0.0 to 0.25, while 'TPN3.0 for NEC' probabilities are clustered near 0.0.

**Group 2:**
- **Y-axis:** Newborn NEC Probability, ranging from 0.00 to 0.10.
- **Data:** 'Prescribed' probabilities range from approximately 0.0 to 0.10, while 'TPN3.0 for NEC' probabilities are clustered near 0.0.

**Group 3:**
- **Y-axis:** Newborn NEC Probability, ranging from 0.0 to 0.8.
- **Data:** 'Prescribed' probabilities show a wide spread from approximately 0.0 to 0.7, while 'TPN3.0 for NEC' probabilities are clustered near 0.0 to 0.1.

**Group 4:**
- **Y-axis:** Newborn NEC Probability, ranging from 0.0 to 0.5.
- **Data:** 'Prescribed' probabilities range from approximately 0.0 to 0.45, while 'TPN3.0 for NEC' probabilities are clustered near 0.0 to 0.1.

**Group 5:**
- **Y-axis:** Newborn NEC Probability, ranging from 0.00 to 0.25.
- **Data:** 'Prescribed' probabilities range from approximately 0.0 to 0.25, while 'TPN3.0 for NEC' probabilities are clustered near 0.0.

Across all groups, the plots visually suggest that 'TPN3.0 for NEC' is associated with lower Newborn NEC Probability compared to 'Prescribed'.

Baseline data were collected between November 2014 and January 2015. Despite consistent use of standardized TPN with electronic ordering in eligible patients, the error rate remained low from the beginning of this project's implementation.::>
