# PICC 

## Advantages

- Easy Placement
- Readily Available
- Easy Removal
- Users:
- Typically selected for use $<3$ months


## Disadvantages

- Weekly dressing changes by nurse required
- Not appropriate in renal patients (damage veins for dialysis access)
- Durability limited


## TEMPORARY CVC

![img-3.jpeg](images/e09ca62d36670dba.png)

- Many physicians place
- Maintenance is complex
- Can't leave hospital

## TYPES OF TUNNELED LINES

- Historical / Brand Names you may hear
- Groshong, Hickman, Broviac, etc.
- Cuffed versus "cuffless"
- Materials vary - silicone preferred for ethanol locks but there is little evidence
- Power-injectable rated (for IV contrast injection—typically for CT scan)
- Antimicrobial materials (coating and/or impregnation)
- Chlorhexidine
- Silver sulfadiazine / Silver ion
- Rifampin-Minocycline
- 5-Fluorouracil
- Work with your local proceduralist (may be surgeon, vascular access procedure team, etc.) to ensure product selection meets your needs

# SOURCES OF INTRAVASCULAR CATHETER INFECTION 

- Hematogenous: from distant sites
- Intraluminal: from tubes and hubs
- Extraluminal: from skin


## RISK FACTORS FOR PN-CRESI

- Subcutaneous infusion ports instead of tunneled catheters $(P=.001)$
- Multiple lumen catheters $(P=.001)$
- Increased frequency of lipid emulsion infusion $(P=.001)$
- Drawing blood from the CVC $(P<0.001)$
- Infusion of non-PN medications via the CVC $(P<.001)$
- Increased PN frequency $(P=.001)$ in children only, but not in adults.
- Take-home point: Minimize PN Line Access "Events"

# SURVEY OF HOSPITAL PN PROGRAMS 

| Institutional Policy | $\%$ | Institutional Policy | $\%$ |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Require a previously unused lumen/port <br> when initiating PN via a temporary CVC <br> (and guidewire exchange if needed) | 18 | Require blood cultures off the line (in the absence of other <br> evidence of infection) prior to restarting home PN | 12 |
| Stipulate a maximum age of CVC prior to <br> PN initiation | 17 | Change the PN line in patients with bacteremia even if the <br> PN line culture is not positive | 29 |
| Allow Y-site injections along with PN | 59 | With bacteremia, hold PN for some period of time, either <br> while awaiting negative repeat blood cultures, new line <br> placement, or clearance by an infectious disease specialist | 61 |
| Require blood cultures off the line (in the <br> absence of other evidence of infection) <br> prior to restarting home PN | 12 | Change the PN line in patients with fungemia even if the PN <br> line culture is not positive | 71 |
| Allow lab draws off of PN line | 65 |  |  |

## CVC SITE SELECTION

| Approach | Advantages | Disadvantages |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Internal <br> Jugular | Control of bleeding <br> Pneumothorax uncommon <br> Lower infection rate (vs. femoral) | Carotid artery injury <br> Uncomfortable for patient <br> Maintenance of dressings <br> Tracheostomies <br> Internal jugular vein prone to collapse |
| Subclavian | Maintenance of dressings <br> More comfortable <br> Clearer landmarks <br> Subclavian vein less collapsible <br> Lowest infection rate | Risk of Pneumothorax <br> Should be avoided in Chronic Kidney <br> Disease / End Stage Renal Disease |
| Femoral | No interference with <br> cardiopulmonary resuscitation <br> No risk of Pneumothorax | Highest infection rate <br> Femoral artery injury <br> Deep Vein Thrombosis |

# SAFE PRACTICES: TAKE HOMES

![img-17.jpeg](images/4575b75f190e3c22.png)

**Special Report:** "Safe Practices for Parenteral Nutrition" (JPEN)

- Precipitation reactions are a real concern—obstruction, infection, embolus
- Never remove a filter
- Do not add additional meds to PN
- Minimize Y-site infusions - confirm compatibility
