# LEARNING OBJECTIVES 

- Describe errors and potential errors that may occur with parenteral and enteral nutrition.
- Examine error reporting methods to evaluate error trends that may occur with parenteral and enteral nutrition.
- Explain the importance of reporting errors associated with nutrition support.
- Select appropriate systems and processes for potential safety improvements.


## KEY ABBREVIATIONS

- EN: enteral nutrition
- KCl : potassium chloride
- PN: parenteral nutrition
- ISMP: Institute for Safe Medication Practices
- MERP: Medication Error Reporting Program of ISMP

# DEFINITION 

- MED-MARX ${ }^{\circledR}$ : Subscription-based medication error reporting program.


## SELF-ASSESSMENT \#1

A patient became hyperglycemic when the insulin prescribed in his PN was inadvertently omitted during its preparation. In which step in the parenteral use process did this error occur?
A. Prescribing and order review
B. Verify/review the PN order
C. Administration
D. Compounding and dispensing

--- page 4 ---

# SELF-ASSESSMENT \#2 

The approach to PN ordering in your organization is different between the critical care patients and the patients in the general medical/surgery patient care areas. What approach could be used to reduce the possibility of errors in prescribing and order review for your entire organization?
A. Do nothing, the clinicians are used to the system and there have been no reported errors or patient events
B. Develop an interdisciplinary task force consisting of clinicians from both areas to review the prescribing methods and recommend adoption of 1 method of PN ordering
C. Adopt a standardized approach to reporting and classifying PN-associated errors and near misses to assist in improving your PN system
D. Adopt the ordering method used in the critical care area to the entire organization

## NUTRITION SUPPORT

- Nutrition support is a complicated medical therapy that includes a nutrition care plan, modification of diet based on disease condition, use of dietary supplements and if needed, enteral and parenteral nutrition
- EN and PN are complex treatments
- Involving multiple dosage of nutrients
- Affecting multiple biological processes
- Risk extends beyond their side effects or complications
- Errors in the system

# NUTRITION CARE PROCESS: A SYSTEM OF CARE 

Interdisciplinary care

## HEALTH SYSTEM SAFETY: ERROR REPORTING

- Errors in the system result from:
- Systems issues
- Performance
- Knowledge
- Factors involved with EN/PN errors:
- Nutrition education in health professionals is inconsistent
- EN/PN processes once developed are seldom revised and updated
- Error reporting systems are infrequently present to investigate opportunities for system improvement, modernizing therapy and improving clinician competence in prescribing and managing nutrition therapy

--- page 6 ---

# ERRORS WITH EN SYSTEM 

## - Access

- Misplacement
- Dislodgement
- Administration
- Infuse intravenously or intrathecally
- Medication precipitation within the feeding tube causing a clog
- Loss of enteral access
- Error - interruption in therapy with less than 100\% of ordered dose administered

# COMMON PN ERRORS 

- Improper dose/quantity
- Omission
- Wrong patient
- Wrong time
- Wrong drug

The Professor Emeritus
The Ohio State University, College of Pharmacy
Clinical Practice Specialist
American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition
Delaware, Ohio
As one of the pharmacy specialist pioneers, Professor Mirtallo was instrumental in leading cost-effective practices in parenteral nutrition and advancing the role of the pharmacist on nutrition support services.

Professor Mirtallo has been very active in professional societies and is Past President of the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN). He also spent many years on the ASPEN Public Policy Committee, where he advocated for reimbursement of enteral and parenteral nutrition in the hospital and home, dealt with drug shortage issues and worked to improve the safety and efficacy of parenteral nutrition.

As a representative to the Joint Commission, he served on the task force that created the Nutrition Care Standards. Mr. Mirtallo has been actively involved with nutrition support guidelines. Recently, he coauthored an etiology-based definition of malnutrition which is the basis for an inter-professional malnutrition strategy. He chaired a parenteral nutrition safety summit in the fall of 2011 which led to the development of the safety consensus recommendations released by ASPEN and the American Society for Health System Pharmacists. Currently Professor Mirtallo is Professor Emeritus at The Ohio State University, College of Pharmacy, Division of Pharmacy Practice and Administration. He is also a Clinical Practice Specialist with ASPEN.
