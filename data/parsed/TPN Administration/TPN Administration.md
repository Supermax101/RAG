## I. PURPOSE:

The purpose of this procedure is to ensure the safe administration of 1) parenteral nutrition and 2) lipid (fat) emulsion.

**Who May Perform:** Registered Nurse (RN)

## II. DEFINITIONS

### A. Parenteral nutrition (PN):

1. Consists of a dextrose and amino acid preparation which is prescribed to meet nutritional requirements of patients who cannot receive adequate nutrition via the gastrointestinal tract.
2. Administered as:
3. a. Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) through a central venous access device (CVAD)
4. b. Peripheral Parenteral Nutrition (PPN) through a peripheral catheter.
5. Cyclic TPN is the administration of TPN solution over less than 24 hours a day.

### B. Lipid (fat) emulsion:

Is a component of PN used to prevent essential fatty acid deficiency and provide an additional source of calories; may be a separate infusion from the other components of PN.

### C. Licensed Independent Practitioner (LIP):

Any practitioner permitted by law and the organization to provide care and services, without direction or supervision, within the scope of the practitioner license and consistent with individually assigned clinical responsibilities and can perform within their scope of practice.

### D. Advanced Practice Providers (APP):

Include but not limited to physician assistants (PAs), nurse practitioners (NPs), certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs), certified nurse midwives (CNMs), and clinical nurse specialists (CNSs) who can provide care and services under the supervision of a LIP.

## III. SUPPORTIVE INFORMATION:

### A. Indications/Contraindications

1. **Indications**
2. a. Patients who are malnourished or at risk of malnutrition when enteral feeding is contraindicated, not tolerated, or insufficient to maintain or restore nutritional status.

### B. Precautions

1. **Reduce infection risk**
2. a. Verify order to use central line is present before the catheter is used for TPN.
3. b. It is preferred to dedicate a single lumen to PN administration when a multi lumen CVAD in place.
4. i. For bone marrow transplant (BMT) patients, refer to Appendix B.

**Departments Affected:** Inpatient Nursing, Emergency Department, Interventional Platform

**Page 2 of 8**

c. Schedule bag, tubing, filter, and dressing changes at the same time whenever possible to minimize manipulation and entry of the system.

d. Change tubing, filter, and solution every 24 hours:

i. TPN/PPN

ii. Lipids

iii. Replace with a new bag even if not completely infused. Refer to Labeling Standardization - Process Maps

1. **Lipid administration**

a. Do not give lipids to patients with egg, soy, peanut, or fish allergies without a discussion between the patient and treatment team.

b. Lipid emulsion is isotonic and can be given safely through a peripheral line or CVAD

1. Monitor labs for tolerance, glucose levels, and metabolic and nutritional status

a. Serum glucose levels should be checked at a minimum once daily on all patients receiving TPN.

b. If there is any interruption in the administration of the TPN or PPN solution, notify APP/LIP immediately for dextrose containing solution order.

1. **Extravasation risk**

a. PPN may increase risk of phlebitis.

b. May administer PPN via peripheral IV if PPN solutions/emulsions have a final concentration of 10% dextrose or lower.

c. Do not use midline catheters for TPN or PPN administration.

d. In the event of extravasation, refer to: Extravasation - Early Identification and Management of intravenous Vesicant and Irritants (Cytotoxic and Non-Cytotoxic Agents)

IV. **EQUIPMENT/SUPPLIES**

A. **Infusion pump**

B. Hospital approved disinfecting port protectors

C. Hospital approved disinfecting swab

D. **TPN/PPN**

1. Di[2-ethylhexyl] phthalate (DEHP) free IV Tubing with 1.2 micron filter (add on extension or in-line)

2. TPN or PPN solution, prepared by pharmacy

E. **Lipid**

1. DEHP free tubing with 1.2 micron filter (add on extension or in-line)

- B. Instruct patient to inform nursing staff of pain, swelling, or redness at IV insertion site, if administered peripherally.
- C. Explain to patient the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia if insulin is added to TPN.
- D. Instruct patient about daily care of the central line, if TPN administered.

## VI. PROCEDURE:

- A. Perform hand hygiene. Don clean gloves.
- B. Confirm correct formulation aligned with order. Check for:
- Patient's name and medical record number on label.
- Match all components listed on the label against the Medication Administration Record (MAR)

Back to Appendices

1. Do not use a TPN or PPN line for any other purpose, including blood drawing, medication administration, "piggy-backing" of other solutions, or central venous pressure (CVP) measurements.
a. Exceptions to the above include blood and marrow transplant recipients (BMT).
2. BMT patients with limited access may have compatible medications infused through the TPN line if necessary.
a. These drugs are infused by attaching a multi-access connector (e.g., three-four way stopcocks/manifold) to the TPN line setup. All other patients must have a LIP/APP order to "piggyback" solution or medications.
