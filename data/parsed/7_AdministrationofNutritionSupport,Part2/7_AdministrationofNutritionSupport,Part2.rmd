# SAFE MEDICATION PRACTICES WITH EN 

- Dependent on type of feeding tube used:
- Gastrostomy
- Transgastric jejunostomy
- Be aware the use of each lumen and avoid medication administration into stomach when concerns about suctioning the medication before it can be absorbed may occur (e.g., proton pump inhibitors)
- $50 \%$ of patients experience ingredient-related diarrhea when using enteral access tubes for medication administration (especially sorbitol-containing medications)
- Many liquid formulations of medications have osmolalities far exceeding that of the GI tract
- Diarrhea, cramping, abdominal distention, and vomiting

McIntyre CM et al. AmJ Health-Syst Pharm. 2014;71:549-56.

## SAFE MEDICATION PRACTICES WITH EN, CONT.

- Nasoduodenal
- Nasojejunal
- Jejunostomy
- Significant risk of drug-nutrient interactions as both food (enteral nutrition) and medications are administered concurrently
- Post-pyloric administration assumes the medication can be absorbed where it enters the GI tract
- Intestinal site of absorption of most medications is lacking
- Potential increased toxicity due to lack of degradation from gastric acid or decreased first-pass metabolism (e.g., azathioprine)
- Treatment failure

McIntyre CM et al. AmJ Health-Syst Pharm. 2014;71:549-56.

--- page 5 ---

# SAFE MEDICATION PRACTICES WITH EN, CONT. 

- Nasoduodenal
- Nasojejunal
- Jejunostomy
- Avoid use of aspirin and ferrous sulfate post-pylorically
- Require gastric acid for absorption and can only be administered into the stomach
- Increased absorption has occurred post-pylorically for:
- Ciprofloxacin, fluconazole, pravastatin, zinc, azathioprine
- Decreased absorption has occurred post-pylorically for:
- Allopurinol, baclofen, calcium, gabapentin, sirolimus

McIntyre CM et al. AmJ Health-Syst Pharm. 2014;71:549-56.

## SAFE MEDICATION PRACTICES WITH EN, CONT.

- Avoid solid dosage form medications resulting in a significant change in absorption of the active ingredient if opened (e.g., capsule) or crushed (e.g., tablet)
- Immediate release products only
- Evaluate each medication for its inherent solubility and release characteristics
- Consider alternative dosage form, drug or route of administration
- Enteric coated or extended/sustained release especially
- May lead to occluded feeding tube
- Increased drug toxicity if crushed
- Do not add medication directly to an enteral feeding formula

--- page 6 ---

# SAFE MEDICATION PRACTICES WITH EN, CONT. 

- Only crush simple compressed tablets to fine powder and mix with purified water
- Only open hard gelatin capsules and mix powder containing the immediate release medication with purified water
- Provide feeding tube irrigation around the timing of drug administration
- Prior to medication administration, stop the enteral feeding and flush the tube with at least 15 mL water
- Administer the medication using a clean ENFIT syringe
- Flush the tube again with at least 15 mL water
- Repeat with the next medication
- Restart the enteral feeding in a timely manner

Boulatta Jlet al. JPEN J Parenter Enteral Nutr. 2017; 41(1):15-103.

## SAFE MEDICATION PRACTICES WITH EN, CONT.

- Enteral feeding tubes with an internal diameter equal to or greater than 10 French are best for administering crushed or dissolved solid dosage medications
- Tubes less than 10 French require medications in a liquid formulation with few residual solids (e.g., homogeneous)
- Smaller tube sizes are prone to clogging
- Institute for Safe Medication Practices resource:
- Do Not Crush list

--- page 7 ---

# SAFE MEDICATION PRACTICES WITH PN 

- Venous access device determines parenteral drug compatibility in the setting of PN
- Single lumen catheters are the greatest challenge as separate IV administration of other medications with PN is not always possible
- If simultaneous IV administration with PN is inevitable, utilize available IV drug compatibility resources (e.g., Handbook of Injectable Drugs)
- Y-site administration has limited published resources with PN
- 106 drugs evaluated with 83 deemed compatible
- Incompatible drugs included: acyclovir, amphotericin B, haloperidol, heparin, lorazepam, ondansetron
- Contact manufacturer(s) for new PN or ILE product compatibility

Trissel LA et al. JPEN J Parenter Enteral Nutr. 1999; 23(2):67-74.

## MANAGING PN WITH SEPARATE ILE INFUSIONS

- Possible threats to inadvertent PN administrations
- Both PN and separate ILE on same IV pole
- Using 2 separate pumps increases risk for rate error
- Double check of pump settings needed by 2nd nurse prior to start of infusions
- Inadequate room lighting
- Routinely trace lines back to source
- Lines confused despite color differences of IV products
- Confusion of rates of PN and separate ILE
- Omission of in-line filter placement

--- page 8 ---

# ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF TNA 

## Advantages

- $\downarrow$ Pharmacy preparation and nursing administration time
- Only one infusion pump required
- $\downarrow$ risk of touch contamination
- $\downarrow$ Rate of microbial growth vs. ILE alone
- Improved oxidation of lipids

Derenski K et al. Nutr Clin Pract. 2016; 31(5):578-95.

## Disadvantages

- Macronutrients limited to one manufacturer
- Cannot see particulate matter
- Cannot infuse ILE through a 0.22 micron in-line filter
- Requires 1.2 micron in-line filter as for all PN formulations
- Risk of ILE instability

PHE-CPOE PN SAFETY IMPLICATIONS

- Prospective, observational study in a large teaching hospital with a nutrition support team; 4730 PN prescriptions reviewed and 74 errors observed:
- 63\% transcription and preparation errors
- 35.1\% administration errors
- $8 \%$ contributed to or resulted in temporary patient harm
- 15.6 errors/1000 PN prescriptions

Sacks GS et al. Pharmacotherapy. 2009; 29:966-74.

# POST-CPOE PN SAFETY IMPLICATIONS 

- Observational study in a 350-bed urban pediatric hospital, 84,503 prescriptions for PN reviewed and 230 errors observed:
- 95\% related to administration
- $9.1 \%$ contributed to or resulted in temporary patient harm
- 2.7 errors/1000 PN prescriptions

## CONCLUSIONS

- Safe use of medication administration via an enteral feeding tube requires:
- Knowledge of proximal end of tube in Gl tract for drug absorption
- Osmolality of medication and use of other excipients such as sorbitol
- Dosage form that is immediate release
- Adequate flushing of the feeding tube before and after medication
- Safe use of medication administration via Y-site with PN requires:
- Confirmed drug compatibility (e.g., Handbook of Injectable Drugs)
- Other IV site or enteral options if no compatibility information exists
- Use of PN with separate ILE infusion increases the risk of administration errors
