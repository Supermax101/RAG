# SEVERITY OF HYPERGLYCEMIA IN PN 

- Stronger predictor of adverse outcomes than history of diabetes
- Majority of PN patients who become hyperglycemic are not diabetic
- Excluded from Rosmarin study
- $12 \%$ of Pleva study population
- $27 \%$ of Wah Cheung study population
- Evidence that hyperglycemia in itself is harmful.

Cheung NW, et al. Diabetes Care. 2005; 28:2367-71

## APPROACH TO IDENTIFYING HYPERGLYCEMIA RISK

Risk factors:

- Diabetes
- Pre-existing hyperglycemia
- Glucose $>140 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}$
- Pancreatitis
- Corticosteroids
- Octreotide

--- page 7 ---

# GLUCOSE CONTROL ALGORITHM STEP 1 

![img-3.jpeg](images/f5f7037ddcd2b75c.png)

## ALGORITHM - STEP 1 ADJUSTMENT

- Establish routine monitoring protocol for at risk patients
- Consider whether patient had been on insulin before
- What is the feasibility of point of care glucose?
- Establish criteria for abnormality
- When action will be taken
- May be different from target
- Is sliding scale insulin the best option for glucose control?
- Adjust the target range based on continuous, intermittent or cyclic nutrient administration

--- page 8 ---

# GLUCOSE CONTROL ALGORITHM STEP 2 

- Identify and manage glucose from sources other than NS
- Is the patient hyperglycemic while on sliding scale insulin?
- If yes, then minimize
- Dextrose in IV fluids
- Medications premixed in dextrose
- For PN: oral diet or tube feeding adequate then taper or D/C PN
- For EN: determine quantity and quality of glucose
- Ingestion (minimize simple or added sugars)


## CARBOHYDRATE CONTENT OF FLUIDS

| Bottled water | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Milk, 2\% | 13 | 55 | 220 |
| Sports drink | $14-29$ | $59-123$ | $236-492$ |
| Orange juice | 24 | 101 | 404 |
| Coffee | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Dietsoda | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Dextrose 5\% in Water (D5W) |  | 50 | 170 |
| Dextrose 10\% in Water (D10W) |  | 100 | 340 |
| Dextrose 15\% in Water (D15W) |  | 150 | 510 |
| Dextrose 25\% in Water (D25W) |  | 250 | 850 |

--- page 9 ---

# ALGORITHM - STEP 2 ADJUSTMENT 

- Establish criteria for categorizing the condition as hyperglycemia
- If significant carbohydrate from oral intake tolerated for PN patients
- Decrease dextrose content of PN
- Taper PN
- Frequency of infusions
- Volume of infusion
- Caloric content if intravenous fluid volume is still needed


## GLUCOSE CONTROL ALGORITHM STEP 3: ADDING INSULIN TO PN

![img-4.jpeg](images/6cbd8f13034198f0.png)

What is the patient's glucose level prior to initiation?

Euglycemic (for diabetic): Insulin dose 0.1 U per gram of Dextrose ( 20 units for 200 grams)

Serum glucose $>300 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}$ :PN contraindicated. Normalize glucose prior to initiating PN

Glucose between $140-180 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ Insulin dose: $0.1-0.2 \mathrm{U}$ per gram of dextrose (20-40 U per 200 grams)

Glucose $>180 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ : initiate PN with no more than 100 g dextrose. Insulin dose 0.1 U per gram ( 10 U insulin per 100 grams)

--- page 10 ---

# ALGORITHM - STEP 3 ADJUSTMENT 

- For Diabetics: determine daily dose of insulin used on a daily basis while stable
- This may be the basal needs of insulin for the patient and can be added to the PN or administered as long acting insulin on a daily basis and then use sliding scale insulin to adjust once PN started
- Consider criteria for withholding or discontinuing PN for hyper- or hypoglycemia
- Taper insulin in PN if patient becomes hypoglycemic


## GLUCOSE ALGORITHM - STEP 4

![img-5.jpeg](images/6cbd8f13034198f0.png)

![img-6.jpeg](images/b5ad383a1d2e5fd1.png)

--- page 11 ---

# ALGORITHM - STEP 4 ADJUSTMENT 

- Point-of-care glucose for cycled PN
- 2 hours into and 1 hour post PN infusion
- Values dependent on glucose infusion rate
- Laboratory values usually drawn when PN infusion or cycle is complete
- Not as useful - establish false sense of security
- Monitor for symptoms of hypoglycemia
- No matter what the blood glucose is, this is a problem that must be addressed immediately
- Weakness, sweating, palpitations, anxiety, irritability
- Serious: seizures
- Long term assessment: Hemoglobin A1c

Jay M. Mirtallo, M.S., R.Ph, BCNSP, FASHP, FASPEN
The Professor Emeritus
The Ohio State University, College of Pharmacy
Clinical Practice Specialist
American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition
Delaware, Ohio
As one of the pharmacy specialist pioneers, Professor Mirtallo was instrumental in leading cost-effective practices in parenteral nutrition and advancing the role of the pharmacist on nutrition support services.

Professor Mirtallo has been very active in professional societies and is Past President of the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN). He also spent many years on the ASPEN Public Policy Committee, where he advocated for reimbursement of enteral and parenteral nutrition in the hospital and home, dealt with drug shortage issues and worked to improve the safety and efficacy of parenteral nutrition.

As a representative to the Joint Commission, he served on the task force that created the Nutrition Care Standards. Mr. Mirtallo has been actively involved with nutrition support guidelines. Recently, he coauthored an etiology-based definition of malnutrition which is the basis for an inter-professional malnutrition strategy. He chaired a parenteral nutrition safety summit in the fall of 2011 which led to the development of the safety consensus recommendations released by ASPEN and the American Society for Health System Pharmacists. Currently Professor Mirtallo is Professor Emeritus at The Ohio State University, College of Pharmacy, Division of Pharmacy Practice and Administration. He is also a Clinical Practice Specialist with ASPEN.
