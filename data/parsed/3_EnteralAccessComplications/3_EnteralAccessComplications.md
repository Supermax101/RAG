# SELF-ASSESSMENT 

Your patient is a 53-year-old female who had a PEG placed after a recent stroke. She is tube-feed dependent. Which of the following is FALSE regarding maintaining a patent tube?
A. Frequent flushing of the feeding tube helps maintain patency
B. Coca-Cola ${ }^{\oplus}$ flushes are effective to resolve clogs
C. Crushed medications increase the risk of tube clogging
D. Tension on the feeding tube can result in tube dislodgement

## PEG / PEJ / G- / J-TUBES

- If dislodged $\rightarrow$ Call surgeon / surgical team promptly
- Major problems
- Tube clogging (diameter, content administered)
- Balloon rupture
- Dislodgement
- Bowel obstruction (J-tubes)
- Leakage around the tube (both externally and internally)
- Assessment of external bumper tension
- Avoid "compulsive" bumper tightening
- Risk of "buried bumper" syndrome

--- page 4 ---

# FEEDING TUBE MAINTENANCE 

- Flush tube at regular intervals and after each use to maintain patency (15-30 mL every 4 hours and after feeds / meds is common)
- Clogging or luminal obstruction
- The most common mechanical complication
- Often due to inadequate flushing
- If naso- or oroenteric tube involved:
- Try to unclog
- If unsuccessful or recurrent obstruction, replace the tube
- For surgical tubes:
- Try everything possible to unclog
- If unable to unclog, consult the physician(s) who placed the tube
- Tube replacement should prompt post-procedure position verification


## FEEDING TUBE MAINTENANCE

- Tube dressing
- No dressing is best
- Simple gauze is acceptable if leakage or bleeding
- External bumper $\rightarrow$ Ensure 0.5-0.75 cm clearance
- Avoid overzealous external bumper tightening!
- If tube is leaking
- Avoid "upsizing" the tube
- Provide adequate wound care
- Consider delayed gastric emptying / obstruction

--- page 5 ---

# FEEDING TUBE CLOGGING 

- Why do tubes clog?
- Thickened formula residue
- Medication particles
- Incompatible substances
- Inadequate flushing
- Prevention:
- Flush tube with water every 4 hours
- Flush with water before / after medications

Marcuard SP et al. JPEN J Parenter Enteral Nutr. 1989; 13(1):81.

--- page 7 ---

# OTHER COMPLICATIONS \& PREVENTIVE STRATEGIES 

- Delayed gastric emptying $\rightarrow$ Elevate HOB $30^{\circ}$ during and at least 1 hour after feeding; reduce feeds rate; metoclopramide...
- Nasopharyngeal breakdown / irritation $\rightarrow$ Use soft, small-bore tube; tape the tube properly to prevent undue pressure on nostril
- Can't miss this! [Medico-legal risk]
- Bridle device- umbilical tape passed around nasal septum- prevents dislodgement


## AN "OUNCE" OF PREVENTION

![img-5.jpeg](images/f497f415eae58d3d.png)

- Many strategies tried; few outcomes reported
- Attaching "decoy" devices to apron or abdominal binders
- Geriatric "activity aprons"
- Works very well for agitated patients

# TUBES DON'T LAST FOREVER

## BLEEDING

- Granulation or ulceration is often the cause
- Bleeding not due to skin changes needs a physician's evaluation
- Bleeding from the GI tract is less common

# SKIN ULCERATION

## APPROPRIATE TENSION

Horizontal Hollister Clamp for J tube
"Vertical" Hollister Clamps also exist
![img-13.jpeg](images/fe059d5828565c17.png)

## INFECTION

- Skin changes only- consider ET/ostomy RN evaluation
- Concerns for deeper infection- MD evaluation
![img-14.jpeg](images/cc4824ea8c05fc30.png)

--- page 11 ---

# CANDIDAL SKIN INFECTIONS 

- Often moist, in skin folds
- Can be seen around wounds, tube sites
- Typically treat with nystatin topical powder, sometimes oral fluconazole

--- page 12 ---

# LEAKAGE / ENLARGING HOLE 

- Consider Vertical Hollister Clamp to keep straight
- Avoid tension on the tube
- Pad tube with multiple layers of gauze to keep tension off (Patient of Laszlo Kiraly)
![img-18.jpeg](images/d9deef2e60139965.png)

LEAKAGE / ENLARGING HOLE

- Feeding post-pyloric may be necessary
- Bad wounds may require tube relocation
- Consider skin protective barriers / dressing (ask an ostomy nurse)
- Evaluate meds for corrosive substances
- Treat with PPI (acid suppression)
- PN- worst-case scenario
- Answer is never to use a larger tube to "plug the hole"

## SUSPECT BURIED BUMPER SYNDROME WHEN

- History of recent pulling / tugging / bumper at new cm mark
- Everything flushed in leaks out around the tube
- Can palpate internal bumper (disk) in thin person
- Significant Pain (often sudden onset)
- Cellulitis (usually with another symptom)
- N.B. Tube may continue to work until stomach heals

# NASOENTERIC ACCESS 

- Placement considerations:
- Difficulty during placement?
- STOP
- Re-assess
- Ask for assistance
- X-ray verification
- Awareness of complications:
- Dislodgement
- Epistaxis
- Sinusitis
- Nasal erosion / necrosis
- Perforation
- Aspiration
- Pain / discomfort
- Migration / displacement

--- page 24 ---

# TUBE PLACEMENT IN THE AIRWAY 

![img-43.jpeg](images/30496aff89bd6108.png)

## AIRWAY PLACEMENT RISKS

- Aspiration
- Airway perforation leading to pneumothorax and bronchopleural fistula
- Pneumonia
- Coughing is the main warning sign of misplacement
- Auscultation of tube flushing in the stomach is insufficient
- X-ray confirmation is required before feeding

--- page 25 ---

# WHEN A NASOENTERIC TUBE REQUIRES REMOVAL 

- Persistent kinking of the tube
- Once kinked, tube significantly more likely to kink in the same location
- Tube kinking leads to either discomfort, obstruction, or both
- Injury would occur if tube left in place
- Nasal / facial tissue erosions $\rightarrow$ Immediately remove; Place PEG or surgical tube
- Sinusitis $\rightarrow$ Replace nasal tube with PEG or surgical tube
- Bleeding $\rightarrow$ Remove tube; Ensure coagulation status OK; Replace when bleeding resolved
- Significant discomfort (risk-benefit)


## NASOENTERIC PLACEMENT

Placement tips:

- Estimate the expected distance of tube insertion
- Based on how the "nose-to-ear-to-stomach" distance
- Assess the mental status, gag reflex, nostrils
- Is the patient cooperative?
- If rubber tube, place on ice for $5 \mathrm{~min} \rightarrow$ Tube stiffens making the insertion easier
- If plastic tube, place in warm water $\rightarrow$ Softens the tube, making it more flexible
- Use appropriate (water-based) lubricant, possibly analgesic spray

--- page 26 ---

# NASOENTERIC PLACEMENT, CONT. 

Placement tips:

- If possible, the patient is sitting in the "high Fowler's" position
- Head facing forward (chin-toward-chest, sipping water, etc)
- Advance the tube in downward and backward direction as the patient swallows
- Stop when the patient is breathing
