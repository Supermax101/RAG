# ENTERAL FORMULA TYPES 

## ENTERAL FORMULA TYPES

![img-1.jpeg](images/765472f58a430dd7.png)

- Broad categories of enteral formulas:
- Polymeric
- Semi-elemental/elemental
- Also called defined diets or chemically defined diets
- Modular
- Individual supplements of protein, CHO, or fat
- Disease specific
- May be polymeric or elemental

--- page 5 ---

# POLYMERIC FORMULAS 

- Sometimes referred to as "standard" formulas
- Contain intact protein, CHO, fat
- Require ability to digest and absorb macronutrients
- Come in a variety of concentrations
- 1-2 kcal/mL
- Also available with and without fiber

Roberts S et al. ASPEN Adult Nutrition Support Core Curriculum. 3rd ed. 2017; 22-56.

## SEMI-ELEMENTAL FORMULAS

- Protein is either partially or completely hydrolyzed
- Protein source is typically small peptides
- CHO may be partially hydrolyzed (e.g., maltodextrin or hydrolyzed corn starch)
- Fat content is modified
- May be primarily medium chain triglycerides
- May be lower in fat than standard formulas
- Also come in a variety of concentrations
- 1-1.5 kcal/mL

--- page 6 ---

# DEFINED DIET/ELEMENTAL FORMULAS 

- Protein is completely hydrolyzed - free amino acids
- CHO is partially hydrolyzed (e.g., maltodextrin or hydrolyzed corn starch)
- Fat content is modified
- May be primarily medium chain triglycerides
- May be lower in fat than standard formulas
- Generally $1 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mL}$; some powdered formulas may be able to reconstituted to concentrate the formula slightly, but need to be cautious with this approach to avoid a viscous formula that may clog the enteral feeding tube

Roberts S et al. ASPEN Adult Nutrition Support Core Curriculum. 3rd ed. 2017; 22-56.

## MODULAR PRODUCTS

- These are generally a single macronutrient to provide additional protein, CHO, or fat
- There are some that are a combination of CHO and fat to provide more calories
- Available in powder or liquid form
- Often given as a bolus supplement to an EN regimen, but may be mixed with an enteral product

--- page 7 ---

# DISEASE SPECIFIC FORMULAS 

- Designed for a specific clinical condition
- Renal failure
- Liver failure
- Diabetes
- Respiratory failure
- Designed for a specific outcome or clinical scenario
- Hypocaloric, high-protein feeding
- Trauma, wound healing
- Immunomodulation

Roberts S et al. ASPEN Adult Nutrition Support Core Curriculum. 3rd ed. 2017; 22-56.

## SPECIFIC INGREDIENTS: PROTEIN

- There is a wide range of protein content of specific formulas:
- $10 \%$ to almost $40 \%$ of total calories
- The low end is for patients who need protein restriction (or who have very low absolute protein requirements)
- The high end is for those with very high protein needs in relation to their energy requirements
- Type of protein varies
- Whey, casein, soy
- Partially hydrolyzed protein
- Free amino acids

--- page 8 ---

# SPECIFIC INGREDIENTS: CHO 

- CHO content will range depending on the product
- $40 \%$ up to $70 \%$ of total calories
- Low end often seen in low-CHO formulas
- High end often seen in low-protein/low-fat formulas
- Type of CHO
- Corn syrup solids
- Sucrose
- Maltodextrin
- Cornstarch
- Lactose is generally not used

Roberts S et al. ASPEN Adult Nutrition Support Core Curriculum. 3rd ed. 2017; 22-56.

## SPECIFIC INGREDIENTS: FIBER

- Some formulas have fiber added
- Often a blend of soluble and insoluble fiber
- May be from pureed foods
- Proprietary blends of fiber
- Some have fructooligosaccharides
- Fiber content may range from 15-22 g fiber/L
- Be careful in patients who don't have a high-fiber diet prior to needing EN
- May lead to intolerance
- Avoid insoluble fiber in critically ill patients and those with intestinal dysmotility

--- page 9 ---

# SPECIFIC INGREDIENTS: FAT 

- $1.5 \%$ to $55 \%$ of kcals
- $2 \%$ to $4 \%$ as linoleic acid to prevent EFAD
- Types of fat include
- Corn oil
- Canola oil
- Soybean oil
- MCT oil
- Fish oil

Roberts S et al. ASPEN Adult Nutrition Support Core Curriculum. 3rd ed. 2017; 22-56.

## SPECIFIC INGREDIENTS: WATER

- Varying amounts of water in enteral formulas
- Generally $70 \%-85 \%$ water, depending on the concentration
- Low end typically for $2 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mL}$ formulas
- High end typically for $1 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mL}$ formulas
- 1.2-1.5 kcal/mL formulas are somewhere in between
- Carefully consider the patient's fluid needs and determine the best formula concentration
- May need to provide additional water via tube as needed

--- page 10 ---

# SPECIFIC INGREDIENTS: VITAMINS AND MINERALS 

- Product literature will state the amount of formula required to meet the RDIs for vitamins and minerals
- Anywhere between 1000-1500 mL required to meet basic micronutrient requirements
- Patients with low energy requirements may need supplementation
- Some formulas have additional micronutrients added
- Metabolic stress or trauma may have more antioxidants added
- Formulas designed for wound healing may have additional ascorbic acid and zinc

Roberts S et al. ASPEN Adult Nutrition Support Core Curriculum. 3rd ed. 2017; 22-56.

## VITAMINS AND MINERALS

- Most enteral products are designed to meet basic vitamin and mineral needs in a specific volume
- As long as the patient is receiving that volume, they shouldn't need supplementation
- HOWEVER
- How often is EN interrupted?
- If frequent, may want to supplement anyway
- In critically ill patients, antioxidant supplementation may be beneficial

--- page 11 ---

# OSMOLALITY 

- The concentration of particles in a solution
- Preferred term for enteral formulas
- Unit of measure is $\mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{kg}$ of water
- Function of size and quantity of ionic and molecular particles within a given volume
- Protein, CHO, electrolytes, minerals
- Free amino acids
- Glucose polymers

More particles = higher osmolality

- Electrolytes
- Minerals
- Higher osmolality may contribute to diarrhea

# DECIDING WHEN TO USE A SPECIALIZED FORMULA 

## E. Selection of Appropriate Enteral Formulation

Question: Which formula should be used when initiating EN in the critically ill patient?

E1. Based on expert consensus, we suggest using a standard polymeric formula when initiating EN in the ICU setting. We suggest avoiding the routine use of all specialty formulas in critically ill patients in a MICU and disease-specific formulas in the SICU.

McClave SA et al. JPEN J Parenter Enteral Nutr. 2016; 40(8):159-211.

## DECIDING WHEN TO USE A SPECIALIZED FORMULA

- Mr. Smith is a 67 year old man who was admitted with heart failure and was intubated. He was diuresed and able to extubate, but unfortunately, required reintubation within 24 hours because of pulmonary edema. The team would like to start EN today.
- What would be the best formula to start with?

--- page 14 ---

# DECIDING WHEN TO USE A SPECIALIZED FORMULA 

- This is a case where a specialized formula is not necessary
- A more concentrated standard formula would be appropriate to restrict volume
- Pulmonary-specific formulas have not been shown to have significant benefit, and are designed for COPD
- Mr. Smith developed respiratory failure because of volume overload

| [Quality of Evidence: Very Low] |  |

McClave SA et al. JPEN J Parenter Enteral Nutr. 2016; 40(8):159-211.

## DECIDING WHEN TO USE A SPECIALIZED FORMULA

- Mr. Smith develops AKI and new hyperkalemia.
- Should his formula be changed?

--- page 15 ---

# DECIDING WHEN TO USE A SPECIALIZED FORMULA 

## J. Renal Failure

Question: In adult critically ill patients with acute kidney injury (AKI), what are the indications for use of specialty enteral formulations? What are appropriate energy and protein recommendations to reduce morbidity in AKI?

J1. Based on expert consensus, we suggest that ICU patients with acute renal failure (ARF) or AKI be placed on a standard enteral formulation and that standard ICU recommendations for protein ( $1.2-2 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg}$ actual body weight per day) and energy ( $25-30 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d})$ provision should be followed. If significant electrolyte abnormalities develop, a specialty formulation designed for renal failure (with appropriate electrolyte profile) may be considered.

McClave SA et al. JPEN J Parenter Enteral Nutr. 2016; 40(8):159-211.

## DECIDING WHEN TO USE A SPECIALIZED FORMULA

- Yes, this would be a time to change to a renal-specific formula to restrict potassium and he may also need a phosphorus restriction if his AKI worsens
- If Mr. Smith starts CRRT, he may be able to change back to a standard formula
- CRRT is generally very effective in removing electrolytes
- A standard formula may help maintain normal electrolyte status, which is especially important if there is a product shortage of potassium or phosphorus

--- page 16 ---

# DECIDING WHEN TO USE A SPECIALIZED FORMULA 

- Mrs. Davis is a 66 year old woman with severe respiratory failure from Influenza A. She is intubated in the MICU. The team anticipates prolonged respiratory failure and requests a nutrition consult for EN.
- Anthropometric data:
- Height: 167.6 cm , Weight: 107 kg , IBW: 59.1 kg , BMI: $38.1 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$
- She would benefit from hypocaloric, high-protein EN
- 11-14kcal/kg; actual weight: 1175-1500kcals/day
- 2g protein $/ \mathrm{kg}$ IBW: $\sim 118 \mathrm{~g} /$ day

# DECIDING WHEN TO USE A SPECIALIZED FORMULA 

- If we select Peptamen Intense VHP
- 118 g protein $\div 92 \mathrm{~g}$ protein/L $=1282 \mathrm{~mL}$
- $1282 \div 24$ hours $=53 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{hr}$ - round up to $55 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{hr}$
- $55 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{hr} \times 24 \mathrm{hrs}=1320 \mathrm{~mL}$
- 1320 kcals
- $1.32 \mathrm{~L} \times 92 \mathrm{~g}$ protein/L $=\sim 121 \mathrm{~g}$ protein
- $1.32 \mathrm{~L} \times 840 \mathrm{~mL}$ water $/ \mathrm{L}=\sim 1109 \mathrm{~mL}$ water daily


## DECIDING WHEN TO USE A SPECIALIZED FORMULA

- Mr. Simpson was admitted to the MICU in septic shock. He has a history of hepatocellular carcinoma and was undergoing chemotherapy. He is improving, but his ALT, AST, and ALP are all rising and the team feels that this is shock liver.
- He is improving, and the team asks for tube feeding with a "liver friendly" formula. What is appropriate?

--- page 18 ---

# DECIDING WHEN TO USE A SPECIALIZED FORMULA 

Question: Is a disease-specific enteral formulation needed for critically ill patients with liver disease?

K3. Based on expert consensus, we suggest that standard enteral formulations be used in ICU patients with acute and chronic liver disease. There is no evidence of further benefit of branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) formulations on coma grade in the ICU patient with encephalopathy who is already receiving first-line therapy with luminal-acting antibiotics and lactulose.

McClave SA et al. JPEN J Parenter Enteral Nutr. 2016; 40(8):159-211.

## DECIDING WHEN TO USE A SPECIALIZED FORMULA

- A standard formula would be indicated in this case
- He is not in fulminant liver failure and his liver function is improving
- He may need a fluid restricted, standard formula if he is volume overloaded after volume resuscitation and the team is ready to start diuresing
- Avoid a formula with additional fiber

--- page 19 ---

# DECIDING WHEN TO USE A SPECIALIZED FORMULA 

- Ms. Karp was riding her bicycle to work when a truck swerved into her bike lane and hit her. She was thrown 40 feet from her bicycle and sustained multiple fractures and internal hemorrhage. She was brought to the trauma center and went to the OR for emergency surgery to repair hepatic lacerations. She will need multiple orthopedic surgeries in the coming days.
- What would be the best enteral formula for Ms. Karp?


## DECIDING WHEN TO USE A SPECIALIZED FORMULA

## M. Surgical Subsets

Trauma
Question: Does the nutrition therapy approach for the trauma patient differ from that for other critically ill patients?

M1a. We suggest that, similar to other critically ill patients, early enteral feeding with a high protein polymeric diet be initiated in the immediate posttrauma period (within 24-48 hours of injury) once the patient is hemodynamically stable.
[Quality of Evidence: Very Low]

Question: Should immune-modulation formulas be used routinely to improve outcomes in a patient with severe trauma?

M1b. We suggest that immune-modulating formulations containing arginine and FO be considered in patients with severe trauma.
[Quality of Evidence: Very Low]

# DECIDING WHEN TO USE A SPECIALIZED FORMULA 

- Any of these formulas would be fine for Ms. Karp
- None are 100\% perfect based on the SCCM-ASPEN Critical Care guidelines
- Determine which one is most cost effective for your facility (look at your primary contract) and patient population

--- page 21 ---

# DECIDING WHEN TO USE A SPECIALIZED FORMULA 

- Mr. Green had a subtotal glossectomy for tongue cancer. He had a PEG inserted at the time of his glossectomy. His surgery was uncomplicated and he is ready to start EN.
- Mr. Green will likely need prolonged (and possibly life-long) EN
- He would benefit from a standard formula with fiber to assure adequate bowel function with long-term EN
- He does not need a specialized formula as long as he has no specific indication (e.g., heart failure, renal impairment)

Roberts S et al. ASPEN Adult Nutrition Support Core Curriculum. 3rd ed. 2017; 22-56.

## DECIDING WHEN TO USE A SPECIALIZED FORMULA

- A bolus schedule would be most convenient
- Consider a standard formula with fiber
- A standard dilution (e.g. $1 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mL}$ formula) would maximize water delivery
- Work with Mr. Green to determine his best administration schedule
- If he would prefer only 3 "meals"/day, consider how much formula he would need for that, etc.

--- page 22 ---

# FORMULA AVAILABILITY 

## FORMULA AVAILABILITY

- Closed vs open
- Closed formulas are "ready to hang"
- Lower risk of formula contamination
- Bottle of formula does not need to be changed until the bottle runs out
- Open formulas
- Formula is in small containers, typically 237-250 mL containers
- Formula must be decanted into a bag for infusion for pump-assisted formulas
- Hang time restricted to 4-8 hours (may restrict to 12 hours at home)
- Small containers convenient for bolus feeding schedule

--- page 23 ---

# FORMULA AVAILABILITY 

## Considerations:

- What is most appropriate for your facility
- How are most patients fed?
- Pump assisted most frequent? Ready to hang may be best
- Lots of bolus feeding? Individual cartons may be better
