# ILE CONTRAINDICATIONS 

## Pediatric Black Box Warning (soybean-containing ILE)

- "Deaths in preterm infants following administration of fat emulsion have been reported; autopsy findings included intravascular fat accumulation in the lungs. Premature infants, low birth weight infants, and small for gestational age infants clear intravenous fat emulsion poorly and have increased free fatty acid plasma levels following fat emulsion infusion. Strict adherence to proper infusion rates, dosing, and monitoring are necessary; infusion rate should be as slow as possible; strict monitoring of metabolic tolerance and elimination of infused fat from the circulation must occur."

# CONSIDERATIONS FOR PRODUCT SELECTION 

- Co-morbid conditions
- Diabetes mellitus (limit dextrose/GIR, assess need for insulin)
- CKD (limit protein, potassium, magnesium, phosphorus unless RRT)
- High stool, ostomy or fistula outputs (increased acetate, potassium, magnesium, zinc)
- Hypertriglyceridemia (restrictions on ILE dosing)
- Refeeding syndrome (increased potassium, magnesium, phosphorus, thiamine; sodium restriction)
- Heart Failure (limit fluid, sodium)
- Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (limit fluid, isotonic sodium)


## CONSIDERATIONS FOR PRODUCT SELECTION

- Organ function (protein provision, electrolytes/minerals dosing)
- Severity of illness (increased protein and energy needs)
- Hidden electrolytes (sodium and phosphorus in amino acid formulations)
- ILE formulations (oil composition)
