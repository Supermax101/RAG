# SELF-ASSESSMENT\#1 

The sequalae of potential symptoms that can occur with refeeding syndrome include:
A. Hyperglycemia

## REF EEDING SYNDROME

- A collection of metabolic complications seen with initiation of feeding in a malnourished or starved patient
- First recognized in refeeding prisoners after World War II
- Re-emerged with parenteral nutrition utilization
- Example:
- 1981 publication "Death resulting from overzealous total parenteral nutrition: the refeeding syndrome revisited"

# RISKASSESSMENT FOR REFEEDING SYNDROME 

![img-2.jpeg](images/96b01accbb79ac99.png)

Significant Risk: One or More Criteria
BMI $<16$
Unintentional weight loss of $7.5 \%$ in 3 months or $>10 \%$ in 6 months
Little or no nutrient intake for 7 days $<50 \%$ requirements $>5$ days illness or $>1$ month
Moderately low potassium, phosphate, magnesium levels

Moderate Risk: Two or More Criteria
BMI: 16 - 18.5
Unintentional weight loss of 5\% in 1 month
Little or no nutrient intake for 5-6 days $<75 \%$ requirements $>7$ days illness or $>1$ month
Mildly low potassium, phosphate, magnesium levels

DaSilva JS, Seres DS, Sabino K, et al. ASPEN consensus recommendations for refeeding syndrome. Nutr Clin Pract 2020;35(2):178-195

## MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES

- Check baseline electrolytes prior to start of nutrition support
- Replete if levels low (refer to recommendations in this module)
- Nutrient provision
- 10-20 kcals/kg day or 1000 kcals/day - at most
- In PN, limit dextrose to $100-150 \mathrm{~g} /$ day
- In EN, limit to $50 \%$ of total energy requirements
- Multivitamins
- MVI for PN; multivitamin supplement for EN
- Advance to goal energy intake over 3-4 days
- Increase by $33 \%$ of goal calories or dextrose q 1-2 days
- Monitor electrolyte levels daily and advance energy intakes when stabilized
- Consider all sources of dextrose
- Monitor weight status daily
- $0.5-1 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{w}$ eight gain per week acceptable

# THIAMINE SUPPLEMENTATION 

- Thiamine pyrophosphate
- Component of key metabolic cycles
- Glycolysis
- Kreb's cycle
- Pentose-phosphate shunt
- Thiamine supplementation
- Provide 100 mg IV prior to nutrition support initiation
- Include 100 mg IV or enteral thiamine for 5-7 days

## REFEEDING SYNDROME

- The most important aspect of this syndrome is recognizing those who are at risk
- Cautious use of nutrition support
- Monitoring is crucial for all at risk patients including those receiving only maintenance IV's with dextrose
