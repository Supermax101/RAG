# SELF-ASSESSMENT \#1 

An institution's nutrition support team has noticed an increase in the incidence of diarrhea in critically ill patients receiving enteral nutrition since institution of a new enteral nutrition formulary requiring nurses to decant enteral formulations from cans into containers prior to administration. Nursing refills EN administration containers every 8 hours with fresh enteral formula. Which of the following is the likely cause of this occurrence?
A. Use of an open enteral formula system.
B. Use of ready to hang EN product.
C. Use of EN formulas beyond specified hang time.
D. Use of EN in sicker patients.

## SELF-ASSESSMENT \#2

It is determined that a patient will go home on PN as the primary means of nutrition. The patient had a central venous catheter placed prior to initiating PN and has been receiving PN at goal regimen for 4 days. Which of the following is MOST appropriate in an effort to provide a safe transition home?
A. Provide patient and caregiver home PN education on the day of discharge.
B. Contact home infusion company to determine stock products and potential shortages.
C. Allow home infusion company to provide patient and caregiver education.
D. Change nutrition support formulation upon transition to home or alternative care site.

# ENTERAL NUTRITION SYSTEMS AND PREPARATION 

## ENTERAL NUTRITION

- Provision of nutrients to the gastrointestinal tract through the use of an enteral access device
- 250,000 hospitalized patients are supported using enteral nutrition
- Used in a variety of settings
- Hospital $\rightarrow$ long term care / rehab $\rightarrow$ home

--- page 5 ---

# INDICATIONS 

- Patients with or expected to have prolonged inadequate oral intake
- Functional gastrointestinal tract and clinical condition(s) for which oral intake is
- Impossible (intubated, unable to swallow or protect airway)
- Inadequate (poor appetite; high metabolic demands; unable to eat enough)
- Unsafe (confused, altered mental status)


## CLOSED SYSTEM

- Sterile container or bag, pre-filled with sterile, liquid enteral formula by the manufacturer
- Considered ready to administer products ("ready to hang")
- Large volume bags or containers ( 1000 mL and 1500 mL )
- Longer hang time: 24 to 48 hours
- Administration sets/tubing must be changed every 24 hours
- Per manufacturer, no more than 1 tubing spike per container/bag
- Less contamination risk (infection), less diarrhea
- Addition of medications and modular products not recommended
- Reduced nursing time

--- page 6 ---

# OPEN SYSTEM 

- Enteral system in which the clinician, patient, or caregiver is required to decant formula into an enteral container or bag for administration
- 2 main categories
- Small volume liquid cans, bags and cartons
- Powdered formulas for reconstitution
- Able to add modular products
- Increased nursing time due to preparation
- Increased contamination risk

Boullata Jlet al. JPEN J Parent Enteral Nutr. 2017; 41:15-103.

## SMALL VOLUME LIQUID CANS, BAGS AND CARTONS

- Open system
- Require preparation prior to administration
- Enteral formula is sterile within distribution container
- Decanted into non-sterile bag for administration
- Able to add modular products
- Hang time: 8 hours

--- page 7 ---

# POWDERED FORMULAS 

- Not sterile upon manufacture
- Requires meticulous handling and reconstitution process using sterile water
- Shortest hang time: 4 hours
- Increased infection risk
- Increased nursing time
- Not recommended for immunocompromised patients

Boullata Jlet al. JPEN J Parent Enteral Nutr. 2017; 41:15-103.

## MODULAR SUPPLEMENTS

- Nutritionally incomplete / single nutrient products
- Protein, amino acids
- Carbohydrates
- Fiber
- Fats (medium-chain triglycerides, oral fat emulsion)
- Thickeners
- Can be combined with diet or enteral nutrition to meet nutrient(s) requirement
- Liquid and powder products
- Typically given as a "flush" to enteral nutrition patients

--- page 8 ---

# FORMULA CONTAMINATION 

- High incidence
- Up to $57 \%$ of formulas prepared in hospitals
- Over $80 \%$ of formulas prepared in the home setting
- Steps associated with contamination risk
- When the feeding is transferred to the administration container
- During preparation, including when modular supplements are added
- During assembly of the feeding system
- During administration to the patient

Boullata Jlet al. JPEN J Parent Enteral Nutr. 2017; 41:15-103.

## FORMULA CONTAMINATION

- Consequences
- Abdominal distension
- Diarrhea
- Nosocomial infections
- Prevention
- Strict aseptic technique during preparation and administration
- Reconstitute powders with sterile water
- Store reconstituted formula in refrigerator immediately; discard after 24 hours
- Discard reconstituted formula at room temperature after 4 hours
- Use formula decanted from screw top instead of flip top

--- page 9 ---

# HANG TIME / BEYOND USE DATING 

- The maximum time enteral formula is considered safe for delivery to the patient
- Begins with the time the formula has either been reconstituted, warmed, decanted, or has had the original package seal broken.
- Differs by system type
- Closed systems: 24-48 hours
- Tubing must be changed every 24 hours or per manufacturer recommendations
- Open systems (small volume cans, bags, cartons): 8 hours
- Reconstituted powdered formulas: 4 hours

Boullata Jlet al. JPEN J Parent Enteral Nutr. 2017; 41:15-103.

## ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES

## Advantages

- Formula and container are sterilized prior to distribution
- Decreased manipulation
- Decreased human contact
- Reduced contamination $\rightarrow$ infection
- Increased hang time
- Decreased nursing time
- Reduced waste
- Cost effective

Boullata Jlet al. JPEN J Parent Enteral Nutr. 2017; 41:15-103.

## Disadvantages

- Increased product cost
- Standardized product size ( 1000 mL , 1500 mL and 2000 mL sizes) potential increased waste if intolerance or low volume infusions required
- Potential misconnection errors

--- page 10 ---

# LABELING RECOMMENDATIONS 

## LABELING RECOMMENDATIONS

- Express clearly and accurately what the patient is receiving at any time
- Reflect order elements, including expiration or beyond use dates
- Size that fits neatly on the EN product or PN formulation

--- page 11 ---
