# Case 

- Jerry is a previously healthy 13-year-old male. He was transferred from an outside hospital after undergoing exploratory laparotomy for a complicated perforated appendicitis. Due to extensive lysis of adhesions and inflamed bowel, the decision was made to create an ileostomy 100 cm distal to the ligament of Treitz.
- Since surgery he has been having 75 - $100 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg}$ of ostomy output daily. He will be NPO for at least 1 week while receiving IV antibiotics for his intra-abdominal infection secondary to intestinal perforation.

Question: What is the most appropriate way to provide adequate hydration and nutrition to GE?
