# THE GROUND WORK 

System-based strategies that promote the role of nutrition care:

- Establish organization policies and procedures that address nutritional concerns
- Maintain compliance with accreditation, regulatory, and safety guidelines
- Track quality metrics that focus on nutritional outcomes
- Develop interdisciplinary committees and task forces to address and communicate nutritional issues
- Identify motivated stakeholders as champions across departmental lines

Tappenden KA et al. J Acad Nutr Diet. 2013; 113:1219-37.

## THE GROUND WORK

Foster an organizational culture that recognizes the role of nutrition care:

- Conduct interdisciplinary education and competency assessment
- Implement technological aids to capture documentation of malnutrition and improve communication (CPOE, EHR, secure email and text messaging)
- Provide tools to facilitate documentation of nutrition issues in all team huddles, formal rounds and meetings, such as checklists and note templates with nutrition prompts
- Establish interdisciplinary processes for selecting enteral and parenteral nutrition products

--- page 5 ---

# COMMUNICATING AND DOCUMENTING NUTRITION CARE 

## A THREAD WOVEN THROUGHOUT THE HEALTH RECORD

- No single section of the record is dedicated to nutrition
- The nutrition plan developed serves as the foundation
- Each discipline has specific responsibilities for providing, documenting, and communicating nutrition care
- Awareness of all nutrition elements in the record provides a comprehensive view of the nutrition care plan
- Thorough documentation by each discipline fosters effective nutrition care across the continuum of care

--- page 6 ---

# TRACING THE NUTRITION THREAD THROUGH THE HEALTH RECORD 

Key Elements

- Nutrition Screening
- Nutrition assessment
- History and physical
- Problem list
- Interdisciplinary plan of care
- Data
- Medication profile
- Clinical progress notes
- Discharge/transition summary


## CASE STUDY \#1

- A 42 year old man, with a history of Crohn's disease, was recently discharged from the hospital on post-op day 5 following a small bowel resection
- Prior to surgery the patient reports poor nutritional intake due to nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain
- At home he experiences abdominal pain and increasing difficulty tolerating his oral diet
- On post-op day 10, he develops drainage from his midline incision
- He is readmitted; work up reveals an enteric fistula

--- page 7 ---

# CASE STUDY \#1: NUTRITION SCREENING 

- The admitting RN records the following information:
- Height: 175 cm
- Weight: 59.5 kg
- Usual weight: 66 kg
- Weight loss represents an $8.4 \%$ decline over 3 weeks
- Patient reports poor intake pre-operatively; has consumed less than $75 \%$ of meals since surgery
- Action: Consult nutrition clinician for full nutritional assessment; reassess every 34 days


## NUTRITION SCREENING

Don't lose the tree for the forest...

- Effective screening depends on recognition of the link between nutrition and poor clinical outcomes: Education is essential
- Typically located within the Nursing Admission History, which also includes screening for MRSA, pain, as well as risk for falls, pressure injury, and suicide
- (EHR placement of information could be institution specific)
- Opportunity for nurses to initiate interdisciplinary collaboration - available to all
