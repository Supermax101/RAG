## SELF-ASSESSMENT \#1

RC is a malnourished 52-year-old male with a postoperative ileus on hospital day 3. His nasogastric tube is draining $1.4 \mathrm{~L} /$ day and less than 100 mL out of his end descending colostomy. His laboratory results include: sodium $140 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$, potassium $3.2 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$, chloride $99 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$, total $\mathrm{CO}_{2} 29 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$, BUN $24 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}, \mathrm{SCr} 0.9 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$, magnesium $1.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$, phosphorus $2.1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$, and ionized calcium $1.13 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$. Which of the following would most likely decrease with PN initiation?
A. Sodium, Phosphorus and Calcium
B. Sodium and Potassium only
C. Potassium and Magnesium only
D. Potassium, Phosphorus and Magnesium

--- page 4 ---

# PATIENT SPECIFIC ELECTROLYTE CONSIDERATIONS 

- Evaluate all measurable electrolytes
- Rarely is there only one electrolyte abnormality
- Evaluate patient's renal (blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine) \& GI function
- What is their urine output?
- Normally $0.5-2 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{hr}$
- What is their GI anatomy?
- Prior surgeries or medical history
- Evaluate medications for drug-nutrient interactions

Canada TW et al. ASPEN Adult Nutrition Support Core Curriculum. 3rd ed. 2017:113-37.

## ELECTROLYTE REPLACEMENT CONSIDERATIONS

- Most abnormal electrolytes need to be corrected over a chronic period
- 3 to 7 days in most patients to replace total body stores
- Substantial portions ( $>50 \%$ ) of the electrolyte may be lost in the urine
- Serum concentrations approximate renal threshold
- Infusion may exceed the renal reabsorption threshold of the electrolyte
- Most are approximately 90-99\% reabsorbed by kidney

--- page 12 ---

# PN ORDER STEP 2 

- Step 2 - How much protein is needed?
- Daily protein requirement
- Minimum: $0.8 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day
- Stable: $0.8-1 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day
- Critically ill: $1.2-2 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day
- Obesity: 2 - 2.5 g IBW/kg/day
- ( 1.5 g Protein $/ \mathrm{kg} /$ day (post-operative) $\times 60 \mathrm{~kg})=90 \mathrm{~g}$ Protein/day
- $(90 \mathrm{~g}$ Protein $\times 4 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{g})=360 \mathrm{kcal} /$ day
- Stock Amino Acids $10 \%=10 \mathrm{~g} / 100 \mathrm{~mL}=100 \mathrm{~g} / 1000 \mathrm{~mL}$
- 90 g Protein $=900 \mathrm{~mL}$ Stock Amino Acids $10 \%$


## PN ORDER STEP 3

- Step 3 - How many calories are needed?
- Daily total caloric requirement
$-20-30 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day $\times 60 \mathrm{~kg}=1200-1800 \mathrm{kcal} /$ day
- $1500 \mathrm{kcal} /$ day is our selection
- ( 4 g Dextrose $/ \mathrm{kg} /$ day $\times 60 \mathrm{~kg})=240 \mathrm{~g}$ Dextrose/day
- $((240 \mathrm{~g}$ Dextrose/day $\div 60 \mathrm{~kg}) \times 1000 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{g}) \div 1440$ minutes/day $=$ $2.8 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} /$ minute
- $(240 \mathrm{~g}$ Dextrose $\times 3.4 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{g})=816 \mathrm{kcal} /$ day
- Stock Dextrose $70 \%=70 \mathrm{~g} / 100 \mathrm{~mL}=700 \mathrm{~g} / 1000 \mathrm{~mL}$
- 240 g Dextrose $=342 \mathrm{~mL}$ Stock Dextrose $70 \%$

# PN ORDER STEP 3, CONT. 

- Step 3 - How many calories are needed?
- Daily total caloric requirement
- (1500 kcal/day (our selection) - 816 kcal Dextrose/day) $=684 \mathrm{kcal} /$ day
- (684 kcal/day - 360 kcal Protein/day) $=324 \mathrm{kcal} /$ day as ILE
- (324 kcal/day $\div 10 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{g}(20 \% \mathrm{ILE}))=32 \mathrm{~g}$ ILE/day
- Stock 20\% ILE $=20 \mathrm{~g} / 100 \mathrm{~mL}$
- 32 g ILE/day $=160 \mathrm{~mL}$ Stock 20\% ILE
- 816 kcal Dextrose +360 kcal Protein +320 kcal ILE $=1496 \mathrm{kcal} /$ day
- $25 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day based upon dosing weight of 60 kg


## PN ORDER STEP 4

![img-6.jpeg](images/9329333f7e9bfc9f.png)

- Step 4 - What is your volume limit?
- Daily volume estimation
- Age and weight based

Most adults (18-55 yrs) ( $35 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day $\times 60 \mathrm{~kg})=2100 \mathrm{~mL} /$ day

- [2100 mL/day (our selection) - ( 900 mL Stock Amino Acids 10\% + 342 mL Stock Dextrose $70 \%+160 \mathrm{~mL}$ Stock $20 \%$ ILE) $=698 \mathrm{~mL} /$ day
- Therefore, add 698 mL of Sterile Water for Injection for a total volume of $2100 \mathrm{~mL} /$ day

| Final Amino Acid 4.3\% |
| :-- |
| Final Dextrose 11.4\% |
| Final ILE 1.5\% |

--- page 14 ---

# PN ORDER STEP 4, CONT. 

- Not stable as a 3-in-1, also known as a total nutrient admixture
- Ideally final amino acid $\geq 4 \%+$ dextrose $\geq 10 \%+$ ILE $\geq 2 \%$
- Change dose of ILE to 50 g to meet above recommendations ( $1676 \mathrm{kcal} /$ day $)$

| Final Amino Acid 4.3\% |
| :-- |
| Final Dextrose 11.4\% |
| Final ILE 2.4\% |

- May alternatively use PN formulation without sterile water for injection only adding amino acids, dextrose, ILE, electrolytes and micronutrients volume rather than meeting daily fluid requirements
- IV fluids may be infusing for other IV medications (e.g., patient controlled analgesia, antimicrobials) to meet fluid requirements


## PN ORDER STEP 5

![img-7.jpeg](images/9329333f7e9bfc9f.png)

- Step 5 - Is the patient malnourished or NPO $>7$ days?
- Yes

- Final Concentrations = Dextrose 5.7\%, Amino Acids 2.9\%

Dextrose $5.7 \% \times 50=$
285 mOsm/L
Amino Acids $2.9 \% \times 100=$
290 mOsm/L
Electrolytes (1 per mEq) $=$
229 mOsm/L

(ILE contributes 15
mOsm/Lper 1\%
final concentration when added)

- Infusion Nurses Society
- Maximum osmolarity of 500 mOsm/L for peripheral IV
- Nutrition Support literature
- Maximum of $900 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$ for peripheral PN
- Yes, it can be administered peripherally or centrally

Mirtallo J et al.JPEN J Parent Enteral Nutr. 2004; 28:S39-S70.

## PN ORDER STEP 11

- Step 11 - When should the PN be advanced to goal?
- When electrolytes are trending the right way or corrected
- Potassium, phosphorus, magnesium
- Sodium may be falsely low from hyperglycemia or hypertriglyceridemia
- When serum glucoses are consistently $<180 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$
- Generally within 72-96 hours
- Serum triglycerides are acceptable ( $<400 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ )
- Separate ILE (based upon bag sizes - 100, 250, 500 mL )

# GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR PN INITIATION 

- Provide at least 1 g protein $/ \mathrm{kg} /$ day (based on dosing weight) for nitrogen losses regardless of renal or hepatic function
- Otherwise gluconeogenesis continues to catabolize muscle as an energy source
- Provide at least 2 g dextrose $/ \mathrm{kg} /$ day (based on dosing weight) for proteinsparing effect
- Evaluate for the addition of at least 1 unit of regular insulin for every 10 grams of dextrose if serum glucose greater than $180 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$
- More conservative insulin dosing may be needed in underweight patients

Doig GS et al. LancetRespir Med. 2015; 3(12):943-52.

## GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR PN INITIATION, CONT.

- If serum phosphorus $<2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$
- Start with $480 \mathrm{kcal} /$ day for at least 2 days
- Then $960 \mathrm{kcal} /$ day for 1 day
- Then $1440 \mathrm{kcal} /$ day or $80 \%$ of energy goal (whichever is lower) for 1 day
- Then $100 \%$ of energy goal until serum electrolytes and glucoses are stabilized

--- page 20 ---

# GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR PN INITIATION, CONT. 

- For adult patients with normal renal function ( $\mathrm{CrCl}>50 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ ), the following electrolyte dosages are initially recommended:
- Sodium $80 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ based on fluid needs \& losses from tubes, drains, etc.
- Potassium $1 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{kg}$ (based on dosing weight)
- Presence of metabolic acidosis or use of medications resulting in potassium retention will also affect serum potassium
- Magnesium $8-20 \mathrm{mEq}$
- Phosphate $20-40 \mathrm{mmol}$
- Assess need for calcium gluconate with above dosage of phosphate given compatibility limits of amino acid brand, final volume \& percentage

Mirtallo J et al.JPEN J ParentEnteral Nutr. 2004; 28:S39-S70.

## GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR PN INITIATION, CONT.

- For patients with normal renal function ( CrCl greater than $50 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ ), the following electrolyte dosages are initially recommended for adults (Con't):
- Use of chloride-based salts (all commercially available amino acids solutions are acetate-based)
- Use acetate-based salts if metabolic acidosis present
- Anticipate effects of refeeding syndrome and drug-nutrient interactions based upon patient history and medication review
- Consider additional thiamine initially for severely malnourished
- Order daily basic metabolic panel, serum phosphorus, magnesium and total calcium for at least 2-3 days or until PN goal rate reached
- Consider ionized calcium if total calcium is $<7 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$

# CONCLUSIONS 

- Primary goal of nutrition support is to provide the required amounts of nitrogen (protein) and energy together with water, minerals, vitamins and trace elements
- Electrolyte requirements are dependent on patient age, renal function, drugnutrient interactions and underlying comorbidities
- Oral or enteral route is preferred (if available) due to safety concerns compared to IV administration
- Multivitamins and trace elements (e.g., Zinc, Selenium, Copper) are necessary requirements in all adult PN formulations
- Reviewing PN orders for adequacy and efficacy are required daily
- Including the determination of osmolarity
