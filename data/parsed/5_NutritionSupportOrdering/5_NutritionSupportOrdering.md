# ISMP RECOMMENDATIONS IMPROVING PN SAFETY 

- Match prescribing and pharmacy templates
- Build, test, and heed automated warnings
- Heighten suspicions of errors
- Carry out effective redundancies
- Provide clear labeling
- Label should always match the PN order template in the PN order form/CPOE system and the ACD
- Educate and validate competency
- Eliminate transcription of PN orders

Institute for Medication Safety. ISMP. 2012; 17(13).

## SAFE PN PRESCRIBING KEY RECOMMENDATIONS

PN Orders:

- Full generic names (unless multiple products or indicates unique properties of the ingredient)
- Include related orders for labs, monitoring parameters
- Use only TJC-approved abbreviations, avoid ISMP error-prone abbreviations
- Avoid addition of non-nutrient medications when possible (if necessary, only when clear compatibility data exist)
- Develop protocols to allow modification of PN orders when incompatibilities exist
- Document in medical record, communicate with team
- Signed by prescriber

--- page 6 ---

# SAFE PN PRESCRIBING KEY RECOMMENDATIONS 

- Physical environment: USP <1066>
- Appropriate illumination in areas where prescribed, reviewed/verified, compounded, and administered
- Ergonomic design of workplace environment
- Establish medication safety zones
- Minimize interruptions
- Minimize noise

Ayers P et al. JPEN J Parenter Enteral Nutr. 2014; 38:296-333.

## SAFE PN PRESCRIBING KEY RECOMMENDATIONS

- PN Education should be provided to ALL disciplines/personnel involved in PN-use process
- Training should include didactic and experiential components
- Knowledge and skills of all individuals involved in PN-use process should be assessed
- Should be part of clinical training programs
- Materials and processes shall be developed and led by clinicians with expertise in the area of nutrition support, preferably from multiple disciplines

# COMPOUNDED PN VS. MCB-PN 

## MCB-PN Considerations

- MCB-PN products identified for central vs. peripheral administration
- If entire MCB-PN bag not infused, need instructions to discard the remainder of bag
- MCB-PN listed amounts per liter or bag. Tools are needed to help prescriber identify amounts per day
- MCB-PN list as ions. Tools are needed to help prescribers


## PN Considerations

- Administration route/infusion via central or peripheral vein
- Volume and infusion rate
- PN ingredients ordered as amount per bag
- PN salts ordered as salts

--- page 8 ---

# COMPOUNDED PN VS. MCB-PN, CONT. 

## MCB-PN Considerations

- MCB-PN products ordered by brand name
- MCB-PN ordered vis concentrations (5\% amino acid-15\% dextrose). Tools are needed to calculate amounts per day based on volume
- Electrolyte dosing dependent on type of MCB-PN and volume infused.
- If entire MCB-PN bag not infused the entire dose ordered will not be administered


## PN Considerations

- Full generic names for each ingredient. Use brand names when multiple products exist/brand may assist in identifying product
- Dosing for each macronutrient
- Dosing for each electrolyte
- Dosing for each non-nutrient (e.g. insulin)


## ELEMENTS OF APPROPRIATE PN USE

- Identify clinical indications for PN, including manifestations of acute and chronic intestinal failure
- Recognize situations in which PN is not likely to be of benefit
- Initiate PN based on gastrointestinal function, nutrition status, and clinical status
- Select the vascular access device best suited to the therapy planned
- Implement measures to promote safety and reduce adverse outcomes

--- page 9 ---

# ELEMENTS OF APPROPRIATE PN USE, CONT. 

- Evaluate response to therapy
- Adjust the therapeutic plan based on ongoing monitoring
- Assess continued need for PN
- Transition promptly to oral or enteral nutrition as feasible
- Collaborate across disciplines and departmental boundaries

## SELF ASSESSMENT \#2

A 68 year-old man is transferred from a long-term acute care hospital to the acute care ICU with worsening respiratory status. He required mechanical ventilation via his tracheostomy. He has required EN at the LTACH and the ICU team would like to resume EN. His nurse stated that she received report that the patient has been complaining of abdominal pain and nausea and that his PEG tube was pulled out a few more centimeters than previously noted on a prior admission. Your first recommendation to the team is:
A. Check a KUB to confirm tube placement before starting tube feeds
B. Order the formula he was receiving at the LTACH
C. Tell the team to order an aggressive bowel regimen
D. Hold EN and start PN until his abdominal pain is fully evaluated

# EN ORDERS 

- These templates can be used to build EN order sets into an EHR
- Carefully consider what would be a "hard stop"
- Critical components of the order
- Example: a provider enters an EN order, but does not specify the patient's enteral access device
- The EHR could be programmed to not allow the order to be signed until that part of the order set is complete

Boullata Jlet al. JPENJ Parenter Enteral Nutr. 2017; 41(1):15-103.

## CASE STUDY \#2

Mrs Jones is a 70 year-old female with COPD who was admitted to the ICU with pneumonia. She requires mechanical ventilation and has an orogastric tube in place for medications and nutrition.

- She is 5 feet ( 152.4 cm ) tall and weighs 48 kg (105.6 lbs)
- She needs $\sim 25 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{kg}=1200 \mathrm{kcals}$
- She needs 1.5 g protein $/ \mathrm{kg}=72 \mathrm{~g}$ protein
- Her needs can be met with a standard, high nitrogen formula that has $1 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mL}$, 62.5 g protein/L, 130 g carbohydrate/L, 26 g fat/L and 840 mL water/L
- 1200 mL of formula will provide 1200 kcals, 75 g protein, 156 g carbohydrate, 31 g fat, and 1008 mL water

# ORDER REVIEW 

- How often should you check to determine if the order is still correct and valid?
- Will depend on the institution and type of patient
- ICU may be daily to every other day
- Stable non-ICU, acute care patient may be every 2-7 days
- On transfer long-term acute care or a skilled nursing facility may be every 14 weeks, or depending on regulatory agency requirements

Boullata Jlet al. JPENJ Parenter Enteral Nutr. 2017;41:15-103

## WHAT MAY PROMPT AN ORDER CHANGE?

- A change in clinical status that may require a change in the type of formula
- Change in renal function
- Change in hydration status (need for more concentrated or dilute formula)
- A major change in weight prompting a recalculation of energy and protein requirements
- A change in the administration method:
- Continuous to cycled
- Continuous to bolus/intermittent
- Cycled or bolus back to continuous

--- page 24 ---

# MRS. JONES ORDER REVIEW 

Mrs. Jones has extubated, but was found to have dysphagia on her swallowing evaluation. A nasogastric tube was placed for tube feeding. She is making progress with physical therapy and hates being hooked up to the pump. Her capillary glucoses have all been $<110 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ and she is not happy with the frequent glucose checks. She is still receiving the high protein formula at $50 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{hr}$.

- Review the order: is it still appropriate? How will you decide?
- Has her clinical status changed?
- Are her energy and protein needs the same or does she need reassessment?
- Should the order be changed?

Boullata Jlet al. JPENJ Parenter Enteral Nutr. 2017; 41:15-103.

## MRS. JONES ORDER REVIEW

- Clinical status - changed?
- Yes! Extubated, ambulatory, working with PT!
- Energy and protein needs changed?
- Yes, she needs a little more calories now
- Steroids tapered down so can decrease protein
- Change the order?
- Yes!

--- page 25 ---

# MRS. JONES ORDER REVIEW 

- Needs:
- $30 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{kg}=1440 \mathrm{kcals} ; 1.3 \mathrm{~g}$ protein $/ \mathrm{kg}=62 \mathrm{~g}$
- Since she hates the pump and is ambulatory, consider a bolus feeding schedule
- Change to a standard formula: 250 kcals, 10.5 g protein, 34 g carbohydrate, 8 g fat, and 199 mL water in one 237 mL carton
- If we do a bolus schedule, she would need 6 cartons/day:
- 2 cartons ( 474 mL ) three times/day $=1500 \mathrm{kcals}, 63 \mathrm{~g}$ protein, 204 g carbohydrate, 48 g fat, and 1194 mL water
- She needs an additional $\sim 300 \mathrm{~mL}$ to provide 1 mL of water $/ \mathrm{kcal}$ (RDA)

If we use the template, the revised order for Mrs. Jones may look like this:

| INHIBITENT ENTERAL NUTRITION ORDER |  |  |  |  |

# DO THE SUPPLEMENTARY ORDERS NEED TO CHANGE?

- Consider:
  - Change in frequency of lab monitoring
  - Change in monitoring of clinical parameters
    - More frequent in ICU
    - Less frequent on floor or in a sub-acute setting

|  SUPPLEMENTARY ORDERS | |
| --- | --- |
|  **Auxiliary Orders:** | |
|  - Assess gastric residual volume (GRV) every 6 hours or before each bolus/intermittent feeding | |
|  If GRV > 500 mL hold feeding for 2 hours and recheck GRV. If GRV recheck < 500 mL, restart feeding | |
|  - May give appropriate medications via enteral feeding tube, follow each medication by at least 15 mL water flush before and after medication as volume allowed (do not mix medications together or with EN formula) | |
|  - Consult Nutrition Support Team or Nutrition Support Clinician | |
|  **Monitoring:** | |
|  - Observe for signs of EN intolerance (include signs and symptoms of intolerance) every 8 hours | |
|  - Enteral feeding tube site care and assessment every 8 hours | |
|  - Obtain body weight every day, or every days | |
|  - Strict fluid volume Ins/Outs | |
|  - Capillary blood glucose: per institutional protocol | |
|  **Laboratory Orders:** | |
|  - Comprehensive Metabolic Panel every day or every 3 days | |
|  - Serum Magnesium every day or every 3 days | |
|  - Serum Phosphorus every day or every 3 days | |

If she has been stable, can cut down monitoring

# TRANSITION OF CARE 

- Mrs. Jones continues to make progress, but because of her prolonged intubation, she has not regained her swallowing function. She is making progress with her speech therapy and the team would like to send her home on tube feeding through her NGT since they think she will be able to eat within the next few weeks.
- The care coordinating nurse reviews Mrs. Jones' insurance and she has Medicare as a primary insurance, and no secondary.


## HOME EN COVERAGE: MEDICARE

- Must be "permanent" = EN for $\geq 3$ months
- Involves non-function or disease of structures that permit food to reach the small bowel
- Presence of small bowel disease that impairs digestion/absorption of oral diet; oral diet modifications not appropriate and patient requires EN to provide specialized nutrients
- Specialty formula may be approved if patient has diabetes/hyperglycemia on a standard enteral formula, CKD/ESRD, documented malabsorption
- Must be receiving between 750-2000 kcals/day, otherwise document medical necessity if outside of that range

--- page 28 ---

# HOME TF NOT COVERED, NOW WHAT? 

- Referral to short term skilled nursing facility
- What information should be covered in the transition?
- Clinical data (height, weight, weight history)
- Current energy, protein, and fluid needs
- Current EN formula, route of administration, method of administration, goal volume or rate
- Water flushes
- Summary of current tolerance
- Ultimate goal (eg., long-term EN or transition back to oral diet)

# SELF ASSESSMENT \#2 

A 68 year-old male is transferred from a long-term acute care hospital to the acute care ICU with worsening respiratory status. He required mechanical ventilation via his tracheostomy. He has required EN at the LTACH and the ICU team would like to resume EN. His nurse stated that she received report that the patient has been complaining of abdominal pain and nausea and that his PEG tube was pulled out a few more centimeters than previously noted on a prior admission. Your first recommendation to the team is:
A. Check a KUB to confirm tube placement before starting tube feeds
B. Order the formula he was receiving at the LTACH
C. Tell the team to order an aggressive bowel regimen
D. Hold EN and start PN until his abdominal pain is fully evaluated

# CONCLUSIONS 

- PN and EN should be ordered using a standardized process
- A system should be developed to assist in communicating the daily macro and micro nutrient provisions if utilizing multi-chamber parenteral nutrition bags
- Successful transitions of care involve communication to the next provider and well-defined orders and instructions
