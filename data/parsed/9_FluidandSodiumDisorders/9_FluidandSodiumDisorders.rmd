## CONCLUSIONS

- A thorough history and physical, including medication review, is important for identification and diagnosis of fluid \& sodium disorders.
- Knowledge of causes of fluid \& sodium disorders will help in determining appropriate prevention and treatment plan development.
- Development of a nutrition care plan should be done using a systematic approach including comorbid states, medication therapy, and changes in clinical status.
