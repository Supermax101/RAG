- Fat (Intravenous Lipid Emulsion - ILE)
- Protein (Amino Acids - AA)
- Macronutrients may be combined in PN solution as follows
- 2-in-1: Dextrose + AA (lipids administered separately)
- 3-in-1: Dextrose + AA + Lipids

# Components of PN: Macronutrient Guidelines - Children

|  Children (1-10 yr) | Initiation | Advance By | Goals  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Protein (g/kg/day) | $1.5-2.5$ | - | $1.5-2.5$  |
|  Dextrose (mg/kg/min) | $3-6$ | $1-2$ | $8-10$  |
|  ILE (g/kg/day)** | $1-2$ | $0.5-1$ | $2-2.5$  |

**ILE doses based on soybean oil emulsion.

--- page 6 ---

# Macronutrients: Carbohydrates 

- Dextrose (D-glucose monohydrate) is the primary carbohydrate
- Monohydrate form provides $3.4 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{g}$
- Enteral carbohydrates provide approximately $4 \mathrm{cal} / \mathrm{g}$
- Typically, 40-55\% of caloric intake comes from dextrose
- Intravenous dextrose must be slowly introduced to allow appropriate endogenous insulin response
- Toxicity
- Hyperglycemia, glucosuria and osmotic diuresis
- Glucose provision typically expressed as \% dextrose

--- page 7 ---

# Glucose Infusion Rate (GIR) 

- GIR needs vary with age of patient
- GIR (mg/kg/min) = (Dextrose (g/dL) x Infusion Rate (mL/hr) x 0.167)/wt(kg)
- Typical glucose oxidation rate under most circumstances $=7-13 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{min}$
- Beyond this, fat synthesis increases leading to increased respiratory quotient (RQ: $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{O}_{2}$ )
- In the presence of pulmonary disease, large energy intake may lead to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ retention
- Glucose oxidation rate changes with GIR based on age
- Neonates, infants: $12.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{min}$
- Children, adolescents: $6 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{min}$

--- page 8 ---

# GIR - Cont'd 

- Multiple online calculators exist
- Online tools may allow calculation of total GIR across multiple infusions with different dextrose concentrations (i.e., dextrose-containing fluids + PN + compounded medication solutions)
- www.nicutools.org ("glucose delivery")

--- page 9 ---

# Macronutrients: Dextrose / GIR Minimum Requirements

Minimum Dextrose Requirements Based On Age

|  Age | GIR (mg/kg/min) | g/kg/day  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Newborn | 7.9 | 11.5  |
|  Children | 4.7 | 6.8  |
|  Adolescents | 1.9 | 2.7  |
|  Adult | 1.0 | 1.4  |

- These are the estimated minimum dextrose intakes to meet energy needs of the brain and other glucose-dependent organs
- If patients develop persistent hyperglycemia (>180mg/dL) at these minimum levels, consider providing insulin therapy based on GIR instead of further reduction of dextrose concentration

--- page 10 ---

# Macronutrients: Protein 

- Major physiological functions of protein
- Structure (i.e., muscle)
- Function (i.e., enzymes, transport proteins)
- Nitrogen donor to other compounds (i.e., nucleic acids, carnitine, taurine)
- Protein should not be considered a main energy source
- Protein requirements vary by age and disease state

--- page 11 ---

# Macronutrients: Amino Acid (AA) Solutions 

- Infant protein needs
- Conditional AA needed: histidine, taurine, cysteine
- Immature synthetic abilities
- Cysteine added in infants $<1 \mathrm{~kg}$ to improve nitrogen balance
- Also decreases PN solution pH , allowing more calcium and phosphate to be added
- Infant AA solutions are modelled off the serum AA patterns seen in breastfed infants
- Further study of infant AA requirements ongoing
- Excess protein intake leads to azotemia (elevated blood urea nitrogen, other compounds in blood)

# Conditions With Altered Protein Needs 

- Increased protein needs (from RDA)
- Malnutrition
- Enteric/urinary protein losses
- Physiologic stress
- Drugs (i.e., corticosteroids)
- Burns

--- page 15 ---

# Macronutrients: Intravenous Fat Emulsions (ILE) 

- Fats
- Concentrated source of calories
- Meets essential fatty acid needs
- Multiple lipid solutions available providing triglycerides derived from different oils
- Essential fatty acid (EFA) needs: 1-4\% calories (minimum) must come from a combination of linoleic and linolenic acid to meet EFA needs
- Serum triene:tetraene ratio > 0.2 reflects EFA deficiency
- Ratio may not accurately reflect EFA deficiency if both EFAs low

--- page 16 ---

# Macronutrients: ILE - Cont'd 

- Fats are infused over 24 hours to maximize tolerance
- Monitor triglycerides to assess tolerance
- Neonates: triglyceride levels $<200 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$
- Children: triglyceride levels $<300-400 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$
- Fat decreases the osmolality of the PN solution
- More concentrated form of calories compared to dextrose and amino acids

# Micronutrients: Calcium / Phosphate 

- Limitations to amounts of calcium and phosphate that may be supplied in PN
- Calcium and phosphate may precipitate depending on the amounts added to PN solutions
- Cysteine lowers pH and may be added to neonate/infant PN to increase solubility of Ca and Phosphate
- Factors affecting solubility include
- Temperature
- Concentration of calcium and phosphate
- Type of AA product
- Dextrose concentration
- pH of the final solution
- Cysteine
- Lighting
- Order of mixing

--- page 22 ---

# Micronutrients: Trace Elements 

- Numerous minerals are integrated into various physiologic functions
- Commercial PN products contain zinc, copper, chromium, manganese
- Higher amounts of certain trace elements are present in PN solutions due to contamination during manufacturing
- Optimal requirements of trace elements for children are not well understood

--- page 23 ---

# Micronutrients: Trace Elements - Cont'd 

- In patients with liver disease, copper and manganese doses often need adjustment
- Excreted via bile
- Levels need to be monitored in patients with cholestasis
- In patients with renal disease, selenium and chromium need to be used with caution
- Levels need to be monitored
- Manganese can be present as a contaminant in PN solutions
- Monitor for manganese toxicity in long-term PN patients
- Chromium may not be needed in patients on long-term PN

|  Solution Name | Multrys ${ }^{\circledR}$ | Tralement ${ }^{\circledR}$  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Age indication | Neonatal/Pediatric | Pediatric/Adolescent/Adult  |
|  Weight indication | $<10 \mathrm{~kg}$ | $\geq 10 \mathrm{~kg}$  |
|  Trace element in 1 mL solution (mcg) |  |   |
|  Zinc (Zn) | 1,000 | 3,000  |
|  Copper (Cu) | 50 | 300  |
|  Selenium (Se) | 6 | 55  |
|  Manganese (Mn) | 3 | 60  |

--- page 25 ---

# Micronutrients: Iron (Fe) 

- Iron deficiency is common in PN recipients
- Also consider other non-iron deficiency causes of anemia
- Consider enteral supplementation over parenteral route for treatment
- Addition of Fe to PN requires consideration due to potential increased risk of sepsis (pro-oxidant), and anaphylaxis (FDA black box warning)
- Consider supplementation in patients who have been NPO
- Avoid Fe in patients receiving frequent blood transfusions due to possibility of Fe overload
- Parenteral Fe preparations
- Iron sucrose
- Iron dextran
- Ferric carboxymaltose (small risk of hypophosphatemia)

--- page 26 ---

# Micronutrients: Zinc (Zn) 

- Important trace element for growth, wound healing
- Signs of zinc deficiency
- Dermatitis, alopecia, diarrhea, immune deficiency
- Zinc excreted mainly in stool
- Increased needs in diarrhea, hypercatabolic states, ostomy losses, intrathoracic/peritoneal drains, mucositis
- Measures of zinc status
- Serum zinc is a poor measure of total body zinc status
- Low alkaline phosphatase may be a better marker of zinc deficiency but is not diagnostic
- May increase PN intake to 1.5 - 2x usual dosing if increased metabolic demand (to maintain one line)
- Monitor for copper deficiency

--- page 27 ---

# Micronutrients: Copper (Cu) 

- Copper deficiency is rare, except in patients with cholestasis
- Risk factors: malabsorption, prematurity, severe malnutrition
- May present with anemia (hypochromic, microcytic), leukopenia, neutropenia, bone abnormalities
- Biliary tract is the primary route for Cu excretion
- Patients with cholestasis have decreased excretion, may be at increased risk for toxicity
- Note that patients without cholestasis can also have elevated Cu levels
- Monitor through serum Cu and ceruloplasmin levels
- Clinical picture should be evaluated to assess Cu status
- Toxicity may present similarly to Wilson's disease: cirrhosis, neurological disorders, renal damage
- Deficiency may present similarly to $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ deficiency, with cardiac disease, arthritis, loss of hair pigmentation, neurologic abnormalities, pancytopenia

--- page 28 ---

# Micronutrients: Manganese (Mn) 

- Deficiency very uncommon in humans
- Mn contamination is commonly found through manufacturing of various PN components
- Biliary tract primary route for Mn excretion
- Patients with cholestasis may have decreased Mn excretion
- Toxicity
- Symptoms include insomnia, headache, forgetfulness, anxiety, cholestasis, Parkinson's disease-like illness
- Best assessed through MRI brain (accumulation in basal ganglia)
- Monitoring
- Regular monitoring of patients receiving chronic PN
- Erythrocyte or whole-blood Mn concentrations should be measured

--- page 29 ---

# Micronutrients: Selenium (Se) 

- Deficiency may develop within 6 weeks of being Se-free in PN
- Can cause cardiomyopathy, growth retardation, pseudo-albinism, white fingernails, hypothyroidism
- Patients should be supplemented if on exclusive PN for $>4$ weeks
- Toxicity rare
- May cause nausea, diarrhea, irritability, fatigue, peripheral neuropathy, hair loss, nail changes
- In patients with impaired renal function, reduce Se from PN
- Monitoring
- Total plasma selenium, glutathione peroxidase, C-reactive protein
- In presence of systemic inflammation, Se levels may decrease
- Close monitoring in patients with renal dysfunction

--- page 30 ---

# Micronutrients: Chromium (Cr) 

- Excreted in kidneys
- Common contaminant in PN solutions
- Contamination can increase delivery by 10-100\%. Deficiency is rare.
- Chromium deficiency symptoms primarily involve reversible glucose intolerance that does not improve with insulin
- Monitoring
- Close monitoring in patients with renal dysfunction
- Consider monitoring both serum Cr concentrations and HbA1C levels regularly in long-term PN patients
- Best method for diagnosing Cr deficiency is demonstrating insulin resistance that improves with Cr supplementation, and reappears after supplementation is withdrawn

# Case: Review 

- Jerry is a previously healthy 13-year-old male. He was transferred from an outside hospital after undergoing exploratory laparotomy for a complicated perforated appendicitis. Due to extensive lysis of adhesions and inflamed bowel, the decision was made to create an ileostomy 100 cm distal to the ligament of Treitz.
- Since surgery he has been having 75 - $100 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg}$ of ostomy output daily. He will be NPO for at least 1 week while receiving IV antibiotics for his intra-abdominal infection secondary to intestinal perforation.

Question: What is the most appropriate way to provide adequate hydration and nutrition to GE?
