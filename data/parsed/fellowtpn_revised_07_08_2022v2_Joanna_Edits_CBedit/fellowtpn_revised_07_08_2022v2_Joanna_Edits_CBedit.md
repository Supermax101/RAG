| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Sodium | $2-5 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{kg}$ | $2-5 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{kg}$ | $1-2 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{kg}$  |
|  Potassium | $2-4 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{kg}$ | $2-4 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{kg}$ | $1-2 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{kg}$  |
|  Calcium | $2-4 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{kg}$ | $0.5-4 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{kg}$ | $10-20 \mathrm{mEq}$  |
|  Phosphorus | $1-2 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{kg}$ | $0.5-2 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{kg}$ | $10-40 \mathrm{mmol}$  |
|  Magnesium | $0.3-0.5 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{kg}$ | $0.3-0.5 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{kg}$ | $10-30 \mathrm{mEq}$  |
|  Acetate | As needed to maintain acid base-balance |  |   |
|  Chloride | As needed to maintain acid base-balance |  |   |

## Considerations

- Patient's weight (> 50 kg )
- Renal function (renally-cleared lytes $=\mathrm{K}, \mathrm{Mg}$, Phos)
- Labs and fluid status
- Medications that may affect electrolytes (i.e., diuretics, supplements, dialysate)
- Electrolyte repletions received outside of TPN (IV and enteral)
- Potassium repletion $=0.3$ to $0.5 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{kg} /$ dose (max $30 \mathrm{mEq} /$ dose)
- Magnesium repletion $=0.2$ to $0.4 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{kg}$ dose (max $16 \mathrm{mEq} /$ dose)
- Phosphate repletion $=0.16$ to $0.32 \mathrm{mMol} / \mathrm{kg} /$ dose (max $15 \mathrm{mMol} /$ dose)

# Routes for IV Nutritional Support 

- Peripheral IV - generally short term, limited calories
- Solution osmolality $>600-1000 \mathrm{mOsm}$ leads to vein damage or occlusion (i.e., no more than D10-2\% AA or D5-4\% AA)
- Risk of severe local tissue damage with PN extravasation
- Rarely indicated if PICC readily available

--- page 23 ---

# Routes for IV Nutritional Support

- **Central venous catheter**—useful for weeks or longer & allows full nutrition:
  - PICC suitable for many applications
  - Tunneled and/or cuffed catheters may be better in younger patients or for more extended use and with ethanol locks
  - Double lumen only if need for frequent medications, fluids, blood (increased infection risk)
  - Ports—Suitable when access need is intermittent
  - Larger lines may increase risk of DVT
  - Confirm central position with X-ray

# Fluid Needs for TPN

- Maintenance fluids may not mean maintenance calories.
- Monitor patient for excessive fluid retention (ie. excessive weight gain, edema, tachycardia, increased respiratory effort, pulmonary crackles).
- Do not use TPN fluid as replacement fluid or resuscitation fluid. Can "Y" in replacement fluids during infusion.
- Give special consideration to children with cardiovascular or renal disease.

|  Weight | Fluid Recommendations  |
| --- | --- |
|  $<10 \mathrm{~kg}$ | $100-150 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day  |
|  $11-20 \mathrm{~kg}$ | $1000 \mathrm{ml}+50 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ for each $\mathrm{kg}>10 \mathrm{~kg}$  |
|  $>20 \mathrm{~kg}$ | $1500 \mathrm{ml}+20 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ for each $\mathrm{kg}>20 \mathrm{~kg}$  |
|  Any weight | 1500 to $1700 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{m}^{2} /$ day  |

# PN Water and Electrolytes

- In most situations, start PN as 24 h infusion
- Order fluid to meet patient needs according to age and weight requirements and consider any enteral intake
- Do not use PN for fluid replacement

# Water and Electrolytes Special situations 

- Don't start PN with dehydration/electrolyte disorders
- Less sodium if edema or ascites
- Potassium and phosphorus levels may rise with even mild renal failure
- Malnutrition increases initial need for K, P, Mg (refeeding syndrome)
- Chemotherapy can increase Mg need
- Antifungal therapy may increase K, Ca \& Mg need.
- Acidosis may reflect diarrhea, dehydration, d-lactic acidosis or thiamin deficiency

*If Dbili elevated $>2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$, decrease IL to $1 \mathrm{gm} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day* Lipids should be $<60 \%$ of daily calories *Lipids run for same length of time as other TPN components

--- page 29 ---

# Intravenous Lipid Emulsions (ILE) 

- Use to prevent EFAD and normalize distribution of calories (so not all from protein and sugar)
- Commonly given via separate pump in infants/young children rather than 3 in 1 solution due to de-stabilizing effect of high Ca concentrations used to meet pediatric Ca requirements and low AA concentration when fluid requirement is high
- Usual doses given over 12-24 hrs/d
- North American default choice has been 20\% soybean ILE given at target of $2-3 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$; EFA needs met with $0.5-1 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$
- Monitor serum TG or other marker of lipid concentration
- TG target $<150-250 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ in infants; $<250-400 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ in children
- Risk of pancreatitis (if TG>400 mg/dL) and kernicterus in infants with hypertriglyceridemia and indirect hyperbilirubinemia
- Some patients may benefit from a balanced ILE (e.g., Smoflipid ${ }^{\circledR}$ ) or IV fish oil (Omegaven ${ }^{\circledR}$ )

# TrophAmine®

"TrophAmine® is an amino acid solution originally developed to simulate the plasma amino acid profile of breast fed infants. Unlike other standard amino acid solutions, TrophAmine® contains taurine and probably should be used in children of all ages who have evidence of PNALD."*

# Trophamine vs. Travasol 

- Trophamine - more protective against TPN cholestasis
- Patients on long term PN
- Preemies and infants at least to 6 months
- Travasol for everyone else
- Short term TPN
- Cheaper!

# Monitoring TPN 

## Monitoring

1. Initiate "TPN Monitoring" lab order set in Epic

- Prior to ordering TPN = CBC, Chem23 (MetC, Mg, Phos, triglyceride, D-bili, GGT), Coags, UA
- CXR to insure proper placement of central line
- TPN days 1-4 = Daily renal function panel, Mg, triglyceride, and UA
- Long Term inpatient monitoring
- qMonday = CBC, Chem23 (MetC, Mg, PO4, D-bili, GGT, triglyceride)
- qThursday = Renal function panel, magnesium, triglyceride

- Give adult multivitamin preparation to adolescents
- Trace elements (Individual addition preferred)
- Zinc, copper, selenium required,
- Consider chromium in infants
- Multi-trace preparations may provide excess manganese \& chromium and are generally best avoided
- No FDA-approved PN sources of iron or iodine
- ASPEN website (nutritioncare.org) has up-to-date guidelines re: micronutrient (and other) recurring PN ingredient shortages

## Clinical Sx.

Anorexia
Failure to grow
Diarrhea
Pallor
Depigmentation of hair \& skin
Dilated superficial veins
Defective elastic formation (aneurysm)
Central nervous system abnormalities
Hypothermia
Hepatosplenomegaly
Bone fractures

Lab Tests
mild, early findings:
Anemia (hypochromic)
Neutropenia
Osteopenia/Osteoporosis
Periosteal reactions*
Cupping of long bones*
Flaring of anterior ribs*
Submetaphyseal fractures*

*These findings often resemble those of scurvy

# Copper Deficiency During TPN: A Report of 4 Pediatric Cases* (cont'd) 

- All of these symptoms and lab abnormalities normalized after receiving copper I.V. at the standard dose of 20 $\mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day (Am J Clin Nutr 48:1324-1342, 1988)
- We then gave reduced doses of copper I.V. (10 $\mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day) to avoid deficiency from recurring.

# Components of PN - Zinc (Zn)

- Zn is an important trace element especially in growth and wound healing
- Signs of Zn deficiency
  - Dermatitis, alopecia, diarrhea, immune deficiency
  - *Mimics acrodermatitis enteropathica*
- Zn excreted mainly in feces
  - Increased needs in diarrhea, hypercatabolic states, ostomy losses, mucositis, and chest tube losses
- Measure of Zn status
  - Serum Zn is a poor measure but is the only measure clinically available
  - A low alkaline phosphatase may suggest Zn deficiency but this is not diagnostic
- Can increase intake in PN to 1.5 - 2 times usual dose in conditions associated with increased needs

# Components of PN - Selenium (Se)

- Se deficiency can develop within 6 weeks of Se-free PN
  - Can cause cardiomyopathy, growth retardation, pseudo-albinism, white fingernails, and skin disorder
  - Suggested that patients be supplemented if on exclusive PN for >4 weeks

- Toxicity is rare
  - Can cause nausea, diarrhea, irritability, fatigue, peripheral neuropathy, hair loss, nail changes

- Total plasma selenium
  - Most widely used test of Se status
  - Fairly accurate
  - In the presence of systemic inflammation, levels decrease

- In patients with impaired renal function, remove Se from PN and monitor levels

# Components of PN - Manganese (Mn) 

- Deficiency is virtually unknown in humans
- Various PN components are contaminated with Mn
- Biliary tract is the predominant route for Mn excretion
- Patients with cholestasis have decreased Mn excretion and may develop Mn toxicity
- Toxicity
- Symptoms include insomnia, headache, increased forgetfulness, anxiety and a Parkinson's disease-like illness
- Best assessed by an MRI scan of the brain (manganese accumulates in the basal ganglia)
- Monitoring
- Regular monitoring of patients receiving fixed doses of Mn over prolonged periods is recommended
- Erythrocyte or whole-blood Mn concentrations

# Parenteral Nutrition - Cycling PN 

- Daily administration of PN over a period of time which is < 24 hrs e.g., 8 - 22 hrs cycle; average 10 - 12 hrs
- Pre-requisite
- stable regimen
- ability to handle large volume of fluid and nutrients over a short amount of time
- The smaller the infant the less tolerant they may be of the cycle
- Putative benefits
- decreased hepatic steatosis
- allows for a more normal daytime routine
- increases mobility of the patient
- Wean PN rate for the last hour by decreasing the rate by $50 \%$. Consider starting the PN solution at $50 \%$ of the goal rate for first hour.
- Check serum glucose 30 - 45 minutes after stopping PN with every change in length of cycle. Monitor for glucosuria during cycle.

# Micronutrients

- **Calcium**
  - Start: 200-350 mg/kg/d
  - Goal:
    - Pre-term: 400-550 mg/kg/d
    - Term: 300-400 mg/kg/d

- **Phosphorus**
  - Start: 0.5 mM/kg/d
  - Goal: 1 mM/kg/d

# Monitoring Long Term PN 

- Vitamins: A, E, 25-OHD every 3-6 months; B1, B6, B12, as appropriate
- Consider carnitine
- Trace elements: plasma $\mathrm{Zn}, \mathrm{Cu}, \mathrm{Se}$, manganese (if on multitrace), urinary I every 3-6 months
- Essential fatty acid panel when deficiency suspected or using newer lipid sources
- Monitor for iron deficiency (no iron in PN)
- Nutrient levels should be obtained when patients uninfected and need to be interpreted in clinical context e.g., CRP

# Ethanol Lock 

- Ethanol is bactericidal and fungicidal
- Nonspecifically denatures cell membrane proteins
- Inhibit bacterial growth and penetrates bacterial biofilm within the line
- Improves clearance of line infection
- May save the line from replacement

# ECHINOCANDIN AND ETHANOL LOCK THERAPY TREATMENT OF FUNGAL CATHETER INFECTIONS 

Kevin P. Pieroni, MD,* Colleen Nespor, RN, $\dagger$<br>Robert L. Poole, PharmD, $\dagger \ddagger$ John A. Kerner Jr., MD,* $\dagger$ and William E. Berquist, MD*

Abstract: Ethanol lock therapy has been implemented to prevent infections of central venous catheters as well as to treat infections. Fungal catheterassociated blood stream infections are historically more difficult to treat and have required removal of central venous catheters. We report the largest case series to date, successfully treating 5 of 7 fungal catheter-associated blood stream infections with ethanol lock therapy and systemic echinocandin administration.
