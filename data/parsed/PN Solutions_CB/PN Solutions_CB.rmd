# Executive Summary 

## Traditional perinatal care continues to face challenges as a result of low precision, conflicting data, and varying clinical practice that often lacks standardization

Neonatal recommendations are often based on weak evidence extrapolated from studies in animals, older children, and adults

Medical advancements have allowed for delivery of an increasingly fragile population (e.g., extremely premature infants, rare congenital conditions)

Inability to predict and prevent complications has led to increased costs and morbidity

Treatment approaches are often dependent on a mix of stakeholders (e.g., nutrition strategies), yielding high variability in quality of care

## Takeoff LifeSciences' novel AIdriven treatment strategies offer predictive power that can optimize delivery of care

Our proprietary AI offers transformational predictive power for newborn conditions weeks before birth. The underlying technology was featured on the cover of Science Translational Medicine in 2023.

Optimized, precision treatment strategies developed by our AI platform have the potential to significantly improve quality of care, boost efficiency, and reduce cost of perinatal care.

Our first product is focused on AI-driven nutrition for premature newborns.

A successful pilot on ordering of appropriate total parenteral nutrition (TPN) prescriptions has already been performed at Stanford Children's Health ( $n=180$ ).

# Starting Off Strong

### *Health optimization begins at (or even before) birth*

- Antenatal and postnatal exposure to certain therapies can adversely impact development and long-term outcomes

![img-6.jpeg](images/fc8c617d954c032e.png)

- No intervention
- Extends life a little at poor health condition
- Preventative care / health optimization

# Big Problems for Tiny Patients 

- Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) supports patients unable to tolerate enteral feeding
- Frequently used in premature or critically ill newborns
- Adequate nutrition is required for growth and healing
- Nutrition can affect clinical outcomes such as mortality, infections, and hospital length of stay
- Many question remain unanswered, leading to variation in clinical practice
- High-quality studies are needed to create standardized nutrition protocols across the healthcare setting

TPN is designated as a high-alert medication by the Institute for Safe Medication Practices
$>$ Complex ordering and preparation process
$>$ Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to errors resulting in serious patient harm

# The Power of Standardization

**Neonatal / Pediatric TPN order issue (administrative, formulation, ordering complexities)**

- Order clarification: 22% orders
- Processing time: 10 minutes/order
- Average blood draws: 6.2 blood draws
- Order clarification: 3.2% orders (P < 0.001)
- Processing time: 5 minutes/order
- Average blood draws: 4.3 blood draws (P < 0.001)

**Intervention**

- Standardized TPN formulations
- Integration of ordering in EMR

**Table 1.**

**Standardized TPN Order Error Rates**

|  Group | Total Orders | Error Rate (No. Errors) | Total Orders | Error Rate (No. Errors) | Chi-squared Test Results  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Overall | 1,996 | 21.9% (437) | 471 | 3.2% (15) | 1  |
|  Neonate only | 1,194 | 25.5% (304) | 322 | 3.4% (11) | 1  |
|  Pediatric only | 208 | 19.7% (41) | 149 | 2.7% (4) | 1  |

Implementation of standardized TPN with electronic ordering decreased TPN order errors in both neonatal and pediatric populations, and for the overall group. Baseline (collected November 2014 to January 2015) was compared with the final quarter of data (October to December 2015).

*Statistically significant difference at alpha = 0.05.

Note: Estimated values of materials and fixed costs from years 2010-2014; estimated lab value costs from 2020

*Depreciation and cleaning, maintenance, testing of primary engineering controls, exchange cost for cabin filters, manpower, depreciation of particle counter device, energy consumption, etc.

The price of the premixed multi-chamber bag that is available in the market that matches best with the compounded formula was used for cost calculation.

## Fig. 1.

Run-chart of errors following implementation of standardized TPN. Errors in TPN ordering were tracked against standardized TPN utilization. Baseline data were collected between November 2014 and January 2015. Despite consistent use of standardized TPN with electronic ordering in eligible patients, the error rate remained low from the beginning of this project's implementation.

Utilization of standardized TPN for combined neonates and pediatric patients. Utilization of the standardized TPN composition was tracked for patients on TPN and meeting eligibility criteria. A. Illustrates breakdown of usage for standardized and customized TPN solutions for all patients receiving TPN during the study period, broken down by month. B. Illustrates utilization with the proportion of orders for standardized TPN given to eligible patients by quarter for comparison to baseline.

# Deviations from our AI increased mortality by 3X! 

Current TPN practices are a major and well-documented safety issue
Institute for Safe Medication Practices put TPN on the light of High-Alert Medications due to "a heightened risk of causing significant patient harm when they are used in error."
TPN2.0 eliminates the risk of human error during compounding. But that's not all:

Deviation by the care team from our AI Recommendations Increases the risk
Mortality by $\mathbf{3 x}$
Sepsis by $\mathbf{2 x}$
Necrotizing Enterocolitis by $\mathbf{2 . 5 x}$
Deviations were validated by manual chart review and were confirmed to be mistakes by the care team!
