# SELF-ASSESSMENT 

SP is a 69-year-old man with a newly placed PEG tube after laryngeal cancer resection. The physician would like you to make recommendations for enteral nutrition management. Which recommendation would be MOST appropriate in this patient?
A. Placement of a nasojejunal feeding tube because of aspiration risk
B. Initiation of intermittent bolus feeding via the PEG tube
C. Conversion of the PEG to a G-J tube for continuous postpyloric feeding
D. Make patient NPO and start parenteral nutrition

- OG tubes - trigger gag reflex
- Only used in intubated patients

# NASOENTERIC TUBES 

- Postpyloric Tubes
- Nasojejunal tubes
- Nasoduodenal tubes
- Common names

Wire now goes through skin into the stomach
![img-12.jpeg](images/177ab41f3a8345c6.png)

The wire Is "lassoed" with a snare placed through the scope

# PEG PROCEDURE 

![img-13.jpeg](images/79afaf26ea2f8adf.png)

PEG tube is connected to the wire. The wire is pulled out through the abdominal wall with the PEG tube following it
![img-14.jpeg](images/80b52eeebf212bfa.png)

External bumper is placed over the tube and slid down

External bumper is brought down to the skin while internal bumper abuts gastric wall

## SHOULD WE FEED PROXIMAL OR DISTAL WHAT IS THE OPTIMAL LOCATION?

- Gastric Feeding:
- Relatively easy
- Residuals may be monitored
- Aspiration risks are higher
- Can be done safely
- Jejunal Feeding:
- Shorter time to goal
- Increased nutrient delivery
- Decreased VAP rates
- Access can be difficult

| Hsu CW | CCM 2009 | PRCT N=120 <br> Medical ICU | Nasoduodenal goals earlier, less <br> vomiting and less VAP |

# GASTRIC OR JEJUNAL FEEDS? 

- Gastric Feeding:
- Can bolus feed if G-tube (lower esophageal sphincter intact - NG stents sphincter open)
- Larger bore tubes usually accept crushed meds
- Jejunal Feeding:
- Continuous feeds are the standard
- Require home pump
- Smaller diameter, harder to replace tubes
- Minimize medication administration due to clogging, absorption, and pH
- NO CRUSHED MEDS

--- page 9 ---

# GASTRIC OR JEJUNAL?SELECTION FOR TEMPORARY FEEDING 

- Depends on institutional comfort / experience with placing postpyloric tubes
- Some consider postpyloric to be standard for most patients
- Give stronger consideration to postpyloric feeding in patients with:
- Known aspiration risk / history
- Altered mental status, altered swallowing
- Delayed gastric emptying / gastroparesis (known or suspected)
- Repeatedly elevated gastric residuals (if these are being checked)
- Acute pancreatitis
- Failed gastric feedings


## SELECTING PERCUTANEOUS ACCESS: PROS AND CONS

- Greatest advantages PEG and other percutaneous tubes:
- Avoid patient discomfort associated with naso- or oroenteral tubes
- May remain in place for extended periods
- Can be easily concealed, contributing to less patient stigma
- Facilitates intermittent use
- Greatest disadvantages of PEG and other percutaneous tubes:
- Complications may be severe
- Tube clogging is a major problem
- Leakage around the tube site
- Tube breakage, especially in areas of mechanical stress
- Tube may be hard to replace

--- page 10 ---

# GASTRIC OR JEJUNAL?SELECTION FOR DURABLE FEEDING 

- G-tubes are strongly preferred over J-tubes
- G-tubes are larger, easier to maintain, more durable, less prone to dislodgement. G-tube permits bolus feeding
- J-tube typically requires open surgery or much more complex / difficult endoscopic placement technique. Neither is usually done. Replacement usually requires fluoroscopic assistance. Tubes / tracts are not as durable
- J-tubes typically reserved for patients with:
- Failed gastric feeding
- Planned gastric surgery

# CONFIRMING POST PYLORIC / SMALL BOWEL POSITION ON X-RAY 

![img-19.jpeg](images/0e6019e6d0dc82ee.png)
![img-20.jpeg](images/2044c0557efe364d.png)

This is ok too
Post-pyloric should cross spine once
Jejunal should cross spine twice
Contrast injected to further confirm position

## GASTROJEJUNAL TUBES (GJ-TUBE)

![img-21.jpeg](images/8d989ec5e08c36a3.png)

- Advantage:
- Provide access to both stomach and jejunum through one point
- Disadvantages:
- 2 small lumens- prone to clogging
- Jejunal limb can flip back into stomach (especially if short)
- Requires fluoro and/or endoscopy to replace

--- page 12 ---

# LOW-PROFILE DEVICES / BUTTONS 

- Low-Profile Tube
- Requires "sizing" because the distance from skin to stomach is not adjustable
- Sizes only available for children, thinner adults
![img-22.jpeg](images/6b98cd68b14f4a0b.png)

TRADITIONAL (LEGACY) CONNECTORS

- "Toomey" large slip-tip connector
- Also accepts some "Christmas Tree" connectors
![img-23.jpeg](images/d1d994bc6a2d65ab.png)

--- page 13 ---

# ENFIT® CONNECTORS

![img-24.jpeg](images/72e31f6f8fb89b42.png)

- New design standard to prevent catheter misconnections
- Enteral connectors are "keyed" so tube feeds cannot be injected anywhere except enteral tubes
- Implementation has primarily been delayed because of availability of devices
- Legally required now in California

# ENFIT® TRANSITION CONNECTORS

![img-26.jpeg](images/19e38b4b37e736c5.png)

- Most suppliers of administration sets have already converted to ENFit® and included a transition connector (Adapter)
- Transition Connectors will no longer be needed with ENFit® feeding tubes
