GUIDELINES FOR PN INITIATION

- Do not use based solely on medical diagnosis or disease state
- Evaluate clinical factors from history, physical examination, and diagnostic evaluations in determining if EN is not feasible
- Conduct a clinical review to assess PN appropriateness prior to compounding the PN admixture
- Use PN in patients who are malnourished or at risk for malnutrition when:
- A contraindication to EN exists OR
- Patient cannot tolerate adequate EN OR
- Lacks sufficient bowel function to maintain or restore nutrition status due to Gl dysfunction

  - Serve as a crutch
  - Perpetuate risks
- **Delay rollout for modified syringe design**
  - Variation in dead space; risk for dose variation, especially in pediatrics
  - Work flow: How to deliver medication to clinical area (Type of tube? oral, ENFit® syringe or luer syringe?)
  - Need for pharmacy equipment and supply overhaul
- **Regulatory influence by FDA and The Joint Commission**

![img-8.jpeg](images/9aa922bdfe71174f.png)

# ADMINISTRATION STEPS: EN AND PN

- **Administration Procedures for Nutrition Support**
  1. Verify correct pump settings as indicated
  2. Two infusion pumps for dextrose/amino acids and ILE administered as a separate infusion
  3. Double check settings with a second clinician per organizational policy
  4. Adhere to sound infection control practices
    - Hand hygiene
    - Hang times
      - EN hang times
      - PN and lipid hang times

*Worthington P et al. JPEN J Parenter Enter Nutr. 2017;41:324-77.*

--- page 16 ---

# DOUBLE CHECK PUMP SETTINGS 

- Pump-related errors
- Wide use of multichannel pumps: enteral and parenteral
- Pump programming errors most common; potential for severe harm
- Double checks to verify pump settings
- Performed by 2 clinicians alone and apart from each other
- Expand to additional phases of nutrition support administration based on quality data, patient population
- When administering the dextrose/amino acid component of the PN and the ILE as separate infusions, the first infusion must be completely set up before the set up for the second infusion begins.

## PN ADMINISTRATION CHECKLIST

- A listing of actions in the PN delivery sequence to ensure that no step is forgotten
- Addresses failures due to distraction or concentration rather than errors due to lack of experience or training
- Focus on key problem areas
- Aseptic technique
- Verification
- Tubing connections
- Initiation, maintenance of infusion
- Monitoring

--- page 17 ---

# ADMINISTRATION STEPS: EN AND PN, CONT. 

## - The Administration Procedures for Nutrition Support

- Maintain infusion at prescribed rate
- Use nurse-driven protocols for EN administration
- Avoid interruptions of PN and EN for routine care or GRVs $<500 \mathrm{~mL}$
- Limit "NPO" periods for EN
- Do not adjust PN rate for infusions that are off schedule
- Implement guidelines for medication administration with EN and co-infusion of medication with PN
- Maintain infection control measures

Worthington P et al. JPEN J Parenter Enter Nutr. 2017;41:324-377.

## HANG TIMES: EN FORMULATIONS

![img-9.jpeg](images/92c21018eee2d684.png)

--- page 18 ---

# HANG TIMES: PN AND ILE 

## - PN Containers and Administration Tubing and Filters

- Change administration set and filter every 24 hours, with new container
" TNA
" Dextrose/amino acid PN formulations (2-in-1)
- ILE that is administered as a separate infusion must be completed within 12 hours of initiating the infusion.
- For ILE infusions longer than 12 hours, divide dose with new container and change administration tubing every 12 hours

Worthington P et al. JPEN J Parenter Enter Nutr. 2017;41:324-77.

## ASHLEY'S CASE CONTINUES

- Patient experiences several episodes of hypotension requiring vasopressor support
- Abdominal pain did not resolve and her abdomen becomes distended with no bowel sounds
- Surgical evaluation reveals ischemic bowel
- Another 75 cm of small intestine removed
- EN discontinued; PN is to be initiated

--- page 19 ---

# IS PPN A REASONABLE CHOICE? 

- Not suitable for patients with hypermetabolism or a catabolic state
- Requires relatively large fluid volumes
- Use as supplemental PN or a bridge therapy:
- Oral intake or EN is suboptimal
- Avoids risks inherent to central line placement
- Central line access not feasible
- Maximum duration of 10-14 days
- Better nutrient provision with osmolality limit of $900 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$
- Associated with increased rates of infusion phlebitis

Worthington P. JPEN J Parenter Enteral Nutr. 2017; 41:324-77.

## SWITCHING TO PN: TIMING

- Initiate PN after 7 days for well-nourished, stable adult patients who have been unable to receive significant ( $50 \%$ or more of estimated requirements) oral or enteral nutrients
- Initiate PN within 3-5 days in those who are nutritionally at-risk and unlikely to achieve desired oral intake or EN
- Initiate PN as soon as is feasible for patients with baseline moderate or severe malnutrition in whom oral intake or EN is not possible or sufficient
- Delay the initiation of PN in a patient with severe metabolic instability until the patient's condition has improved

--- page 20 ---

# SELF ASSESSMENT \#6 

PN is initiated for nutritional support. On the second night the nurse calls the pharmacy to report that the the PN filter seems to be occluded and a "high pressure" pump alarm has sounded. What is the most appropriate course of action in this situation?
A. Silence the alarm
B. Send a new filter to the unit
C. Remove the filter and continue the infusion
D. Stop the infusion and review the PN formulation

# OCCLUDED PN FILTERS 

- High pressure pump alarms and occluded filters
- Incorrect size filter used?
- Verify pressure setting on pump
- Precipitate or particulate matter present
![img-10.jpeg](images/97a56f6a3595dc6d.png)

- Rule out mechanical or thrombotic causes
- Stop the PN infusion
- Remove and replace filter
- Pharmacy must review PN formulation for precipitates, incompatibilities, or cracked emulsions?
- Never allow infusion of unfiltered PN and ILE formulations

Ayers P et al. JPEN J Parenter Enteral Nutr. 2014; 38:296-333.
Worthington et al. Nutr Clin Prad. 2021 Feb; 36(1):29-39.

## RECOMMENDATIONS: FILTERS FOR PN AND ILE

- In-line filters are required on all PN and ILE infusions
- In-line filters serve to reduce exposure to particulate matter during PN administration
- A 1.2 micron in-line filter is recommended for administration of both TNAs and 2-in-1 PNs
- For TNAs, place the filter as close to the catheter hub as possible
- For 2-in-1 PNs, place the filter below the Y-site where the dextrose-amino acid admixture and the ILE co-infuse
- This practice is supported by decades of experience in hospital and home PN administration settings. This approach also eliminates filter confusion.

# WEANING PN

![img-13.jpeg](images/b3b9d8483eb30de7.png)

- Wean PN when oral intake and/or EN achieves 50%-75% of requirements for energy, protein, and micronutrients.
- Continue PN when impaired GI function precludes 100% absorption of nutrient needs.
- Consider using a weaning protocol during the transition from PN to EN.
