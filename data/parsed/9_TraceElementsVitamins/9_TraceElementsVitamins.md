## TE ABNORMALITIES IN LONG-TERM PN

| Trace Element | Abnormality |
| :--: | :--: |
| Zinc | Deficiency: immune, Gl, skin, CNS, skeletal, reproductive systems affected. Increased losses in Gl fluid - mostfrequentsuspected deficiency Toxicity has been reported - immune dysfunction and Gl distress (30-75 $\mathrm{mg} /$ day) <br> 100-Fold overdose resulted in death of a neonate due to improper compounding practices |
| Copper | Deficiency - pancytopenia (omitted from PN due to elevated bilirubin), loss of balance or position and movement of the body Serum copper level to monitor |
| Chromium | Hyperglycemia, deficiency may not be adequately identified with serum levels - watch for patient response to supplementation |

--- page 4 ---

# TE ABNORMALITIES IN LONG-TERM PN

|  Trace Element | Abnormality  |
| --- | --- |
|  Manganese | Adverse effects due to CNS accumulation. Best indicator of status is manganese superoxide dismutase of mononuclear blood cells (most common markers are serum levels and erythrocyte concentrations)  |
|  Selenium | Deficiency, guidelines for use in PN inconsistent, serum and red blood cell – glutathione peroxidase and urinary selenium are indicators of selenium status  |

Jay M. Mirtallo, M.S., R.Ph, BCNSP, FASHP, FASPEN
The Professor Emeritus
The Ohio State University, College of Pharmacy
Clinical Practice Specialist
American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition
Delaware, Ohio
As one of the pharmacy specialist pioneers, Professor Mirtallo was instrumental in leading cost-effective practices in parenteral nutrition and advancing the role of the pharmacist on nutrition support services.

Professor Mirtallo has been very active in professional societies and is Past President of the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN). He also spent many years on the ASPEN Public Policy Committee, where he advocated for reimbursement of enteral and parenteral nutrition in the hospital and home, dealt with drug shortage issues and worked to improve the safety and efficacy of parenteral nutrition.

As a representative to the Joint Commission, he served on the task force that created the Nutrition Care Standards. Mr. Mirtallo has been actively involved with nutrition support guidelines. Recently, he coauthored an etiology-based definition of malnutrition which is the basis for an inter-professional malnutrition strategy. He chaired a parenteral nutrition safety summit in the fall of 2011 which led to the development of the safety consensus recommendations released by ASPEN and the American Society for Health System Pharmacists. Currently Professor Mirtallo is Professor Emeritus at The Ohio State University, College of Pharmacy, Division of Pharmacy Practice and Administration. He is also a Clinical Practice Specialist with ASPEN.
