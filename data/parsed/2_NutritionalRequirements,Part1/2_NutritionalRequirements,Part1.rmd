# LEARNING OBJECTIVES 

- Evaluate parenteral nutrition orders for the appropriate content and use of macronutrients based on estimated requirements.
- Design a parenteral nutrition formulation that limits dextrose provision while balancing overall nutrient requirements.
- Compare minimum requirements of available lipid emulsion formulations to prevent essential fatty acid deficiency.
- Calculate a patient's estimated fluid requirements using the three most common methods.
- Evaluate the clinical need to modify fluid provision compared to calculated maintenance fluid requirements.

# CONCLUSIONS 

- Primary goal of nutrition support is to provide the required amounts of nitrogen (protein) and energy together with water, minerals, vitamins and trace elements
- Dependent on patient age, presence of malnutrition and underlying comorbidities
- Protein dosing is dependent upon nitrogen losses and physiologic status
- Providing adequate non-protein calories to have a protein-sparing effect
- Combinations of carbohydrate (e.g., dextrose) and fat (e.g., ILE) with protein are required for meeting energy requirements
- Fluid needs are dictated by maintenance requirements in addition to ongoing losses (e.g., diarrhea)
