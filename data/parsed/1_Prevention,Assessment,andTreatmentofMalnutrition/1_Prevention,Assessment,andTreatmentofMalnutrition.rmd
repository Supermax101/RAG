# FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE 

"There may be four different causes, any of which will provide the same result, the patient slowly starving to death for want of nutrition:"

- defect in cooking
- defect in choice of diet
- defect in choice of hours for taking diet
- defect in appetite of patient

## LANDMARK PUBLICATION

1974 Publication "The Skeleton in the Hospital Closet"
"I suspect, as a matter of fact, that one of the largest pockets of unrecognized malnutrition in America exists not in rural slums or urban ghettos, but in the private rooms and wards of big city hospitals."

--- page 6 ---

# MALNUTRITION RECOGNITION 

"Underfeeding is a debt that must eventually be repaid, and like all debts it is made worse when it is compounded."

- Richard D. Griffiths M.D.

Weinsier, RL et al. Am J Clin Nutr. 1979;32:418-426.

## MALNUTRITION DEFINITION

![img-3.jpeg](images/0b89e2f900739d0b.png)
"An acute, subacute or chronic state of nutrition, in which a combination of varying degrees of overnutrition or undernutrition with or without inflammatory activity have led to a change in body composition and diminished function."

--- page 7 ---

# MALNUTRITION RECOGNITION 

## Personal

- Age
- Apathy/Depression
- Disease
- Inability to buy/prepare food
- Inability to chew/swallow
- Limited mobility
- Sensory loss
- Medications
- Therapies: ventilators/drains/NPO

Kubrak C et al. Int J Nurs Stud. 2007; 44(6):1036-54.

## Organizational

# NUTRITION SCREENING TOOLS 

- Should be simple and easy to use
- Should be a sensitive, specific, and reliable tool
- Should have broad applicability
- Common valid nutrition screening tools:
- Malnutrition screening tool (MST)
- Nutrition Risk Score 2002 - NRS 2002
- Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST)
- Mini-Nutrition Assessment Short Form (MNA-SF)

Skipper A et al. JPEN J Parenter Enteral Nutr. 2011;36:292-298.

## NUTRITION SCREENING TOOLS

- MST
- Weight loss, appetite
- NRS 2002
- Weight loss, body mass index, disease severity, age
- MUST
- Weight loss, BMI, food intake, disease severity
- MNA-SF
- Weight loss, food intake, appetite, disease severity, depression

--- page 13 ---

# MALNUTRITION SCREENING TOOL 

- Have you recently lost weight without trying?
- No (0) / Unsure (2)
- If Yes, how much weight have you lost?
- 2-13lbs (1) / 14-23lbs (2) / 24-33lbs (3) / 34lbs (3) / Unsure (2)
- Have you been eating poorly because of decreased appetite?
- No (0) / Yes (1)
- Add response to find MST score
- MST $=0$ or $1 \rightarrow$ not at risk
- MST $=2$ or more $\rightarrow$ at risk

Malnutrition screening tool (MST) adapted from Abbott Nutrition Form.

## NUTRITION SCREENING DURING HOSPITALIZATION

- Hospitalized patients often don't eat well
- Audit of mealtimes in European hospital 2016
- Approximately 40\% of patients ate half or less of their meal
- nutritionDay ${ }^{\circledR}$ confirms similar findings

# NUTRITION SCREENING DURING HOSPITALIZATION

- Approx or less
- nutritionDay ${ }^{\circledR}$ confirms similar findings

Audit of Mealtimes in European Hospital (2016)
$\pm 75-100 \%$ of meal $\pm 25-50 \%$ of meal $\pm$ Nothing
All clinicians can identify those patients not eating well and refer them to the nutrition clinician for additional assessment and follow-up

## MALNUTRITION CHARACTERISTICS

The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics/ASPEN Consensus Characteristics:

- Unintentional weight loss
- Evidence of inadequate intake
- Loss of muscle mass
- Loss of subcutaneous fat
- Fluid accumulation
- Reduced hand grip strength
*The presence of two or more characteristics is necessary for the diagnosis of malnutrition

--- page 17 ---

# SEVERE MALNUTRITION CRITERIA 

| Characteristic | Acute Illness/Injury | Chronic Illness | Social/ <br> Environmental |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Weight Loss | $>2 \% / 1$ week <br> $>5 \% / 1$ month <br> $>7.5 \% / 3$ months | $5 \% / 1$ month <br> $>7.5 \% / 3$ months <br> $>10 \% / 6$ months <br> $>20 \% / 1$ year | $>5 \% / 1$ month <br> $>7.5 \% / 3$ months <br> $>10 \% / 6$ months <br> $>20 \% / 1$ year |
| Energy Intake | $</=50 \%$ for $>/=5$ days | $</=75 \%$ for $>/=1$ month | $</=50 \%$ for $>/=1$ month |
| Body Fat | Moderate depletion | Severe depletion | Severe depletion |
| Muscle Mass | Moderate depletion | Severe depletion | Severe depletion |
| Fluid Accumulation | Moderate $\rightarrow$ Severe | Severe | Severe |
| Grip Strength | Not recommended in the ICU | Reduced for age/gender | Reduced for age/gender |

![img-12.jpeg](images/2d168e791640e9f6.png)

--- page 18 ---

# PHYSICAL ASSESSMENT 

- Fat loss
- Orbital
- Triceps
- Mid-axillary
- Muscle wasting
- Temporal
- Scapular and clavicular
- Interosseous areas of hand
- Quadriceps and deltoid areas
- Calf muscle
- Biceps

![img-13.jpeg](images/97c37dce0e1ac5ba.png)

## WHY NOT SERUM ALBUMIN OR VISCERAL PROTEINS?

- Body down-regulates albumin synthesis so that needed proteins for immune, clotting, and wound healing functions can be made
- Positive - antibodies, complement, C-reactive protein, and fibrinogen
- Negative - albumin, transferrin, prealbumin, retinol binding protein
- Malnourished individuals (pure semi-starvation) likely will exhibit normal visceral proteins (anorexia nervosa)
- Any degree of inflammation will down-regulate visceral protein synthesis
- Infection, obesity, surgical stress, chronic inflammatory disease, malignancy, etc

--- page 19 ---

# MALNUTRITION ASSESSMENT PROCESS 

- Perform nutrition screen
- If positive screen, refer to nutrition clinician
- Assess for the presence of inflammation
- Determine etiology of potential malnutrition
- Assess for presence of two malnutrition characteristics
- Is the patient malnourished?
- If yes, determine severity via thresholds of specific characteristics

## PATIENT CASE STUDY

- LC, a 70 year old female, was admitted with likely SBO
- Transferred from a critical access hospital (1 week admission)
- LC reports a 2 week history of worsening abdominal pain with nausea and occasional vomiting on admission to the critical access hospital; 3 week history of anorexia and poor eating
- Previous hospital course included NGT placement, IV and NPO status
- NGT removal and diet advancement unsuccessful; patient transferred to regional center
- Admission Ht: 5' 4"
- Admission Wt: 123 lbs, Usual Wt (4 weeks ago): 130lbs

--- page 21 ---

# LC HOSPITAL COURSE 

The admitting nurse performs a nutrition screen using the MST

- What is the MST score for LC?
- Should LC be referred to the RD for a nutrition assessment?


## MALNUTRITION SCREENING TOOL

- Have you recently lost weight without trying?
- No (0) / Unsure (2) / Yes (see below)
- If yes, how much weight have you lost?
- 2-13lbs (1) / 14-23lbs (2) / 24-33lbs (3) / 34lbs (3) / Unsure (2)
- Have you been eating poorly because of decreased appetite?
- No (0) / Yes (1)
- Add response to find MST score
- MST $=0$ or $1 \rightarrow$ not at risk
- MST $=2$ or more $\rightarrow$ at risk

Malnutrition screening tool (MST) adapted from Abbott Nutrition Form.

--- page 22 ---

# LC HOSPITAL COURSE 

The admitting nurse performs a nutrition screen using the MST

- What is the MST score for LC?
- Her score is 2
- Yes to weight loss of 7 lbs $=1$
- Poorly eating $=1$
- Should LC be referred to the dietitian for a nutrition assessment?
- Yes, a score of 2 or higher = automatic referral to a dietitian


## LC NUTRITION ASSESSMENT

| Anthropometric <br> Data | Intake | Physical Assessment <br> and Lab Data |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| - Weight loss of 7 lbs over <br> four weeks <br> - Equates to to <br> approximately $5 \%$ weight <br> loss in one month <br> - Hand grip strength <br> markedly reduced | - Poor appetite $X$ four <br> weeks <br> - Eating about half to $75 \%$ <br> of normal meals over past <br> month | - No evidence of fat loss <br> - No evidence of muscle <br> loss <br> - No edema present <br> - Albumin $-2.9 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L}$ <br> - Prealbumin $-11.2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ |
