- EN tolerance definitions vary considerably
- Defined by Wang et al. as two or more GI symptoms
- $32 \%$ experienced intolerance
- Blaser et al. defined as "a complex assessment of GI symptoms" vs "a single measurement"

--- page 5 ---

Nausea and vomiting:

- Occurrence ranges from 7\%- 26\% of critically ill patients
- Delayed GE most common cause
- Gastroparesis etiologies
- Connective tissue disorders, autoimmune disorders, prior gastric surgery, ischemia, and medications
- Diabetes: Demonstrated 47\% delayed GE in Type I diabetes
- Medications: Narcotics, tricyclic antidepressants, anticholinergics, octreotide, etc.

Wang K et al. JPEN J Parent Enteral Nutr. 2016; 41:959-67.
Blaser AR et al. Clin Nutr. 2015; 34:956-61.

## DELAYED GASTRIC EMPTYING IN THE ICU

- Hyperglycemia
- Medications (opiates, catecholamines)
- Increased intracranial pressure
- Electrolyte abnormalities
- Ischemia, hypoxia
- Sepsis
- Burns, trauma, surgery
- High fat enteral formulas
- Physiology
- Nguyen et al.

--- page 6 ---

# INTERVENTIONS FOR GASTROPARESIS 

- Modification of narcotic medications
- Change enteral formula to a low fiber formula without excessive fat content
- Reduce feeding volume
- Changing feeding administration
- Consider a prokinetic agent

Malone A et al. ASPEN nutrition support core curriculum. 3rd ed. 2017:265-84.

## ABDOMINAL DISTENTION

- Common reason for EN interruption
- May be associated with bloating and cramping
- Etiologies
- Ileus
- Obstruction
- Obstipation
- Diarrhea
- Visual inspection and palpation important for assessment
- Screen GI abnormality with abdominal film
- May require more definitive radiology

--- page 7 ---

# DIARRHEA 

- Most common GI side effect with EN (2\% - 68\% prevalence)
- Standard definition is important
- Normal stool water: $250-500 \mathrm{~mL}$
- $>500 \mathrm{~mL}$ stool/day
- > 3 liquid stools/day
- Often underappreciated
- Disrupts rehabilitation
- Increases risk of skin breakdown
- Increases fluid and electrolyte losses

Brito-Ashurst I et al. JPEN J Parenter Enteral Nutr. 2016; 40:913-23.
Ferrie S et al. Aust Crit Care. 2007; 20:7-13.

## ETIOLOGY OF DIARRHEA

| Osmotic | Secretory |
| :--: | :--: |
| - Undigested nutrients result in a hyperosmolar load <br> - Watery stool is rapidly evacuated <br> - Bloating, gas and distention <br> - Lactose intolerance well known example <br> - Osmotic gap > 100 mOsm <br> - Responds well to fasting | - Watery stools without gas, bloating <br> - Most frequent cause is bacterial invasion of gut <br> - Does not respond to fasting <br> - Stool osmotic gap: 50 - 100 mOsm <br> - Treatment focused on underlying disease process |

--- page 8 ---

# DIARRHEA - TREATMENT STRATEGIES 

- Discontinue offensive medications or diluents
- Hyperosmolar
- Sorbitol - 10-20 grams can lead to GI effects
- Identify source of maldigestion and/or malabsorption and treat accordingly
- Short bowel syndrome, pancreatic exocrine dysfunction, vagotomy
- Alter nutrient form
- Chemically defined nutrients
- Pancreatic enzymes if applicable
- Consider antidiarrheal agent
- Discontinue EN if unable to resolve

Malone A et al. ASPEN nutrition support core curriculum, 3rd ed. 2017:265-84.

## PEPTIDE VS INTACT NUTRIENT FORMULA

- Pilot trial in ICU patients ( $n=49$ )
- RCT comparing peptide (fish oil and MCT) vs standard enteral formula
- Tolerance and EN volume baseline measurements collected and up to 21 days of feeding.
- Results
- Significantly fewer days with adverse events
- Significantly fewer days with undesired GI events
- Significantly fewer days with distention post baseline

--- page 9 ---

- Significantly fewer days with distention post baseline

Seres DS et al. Clin Nutr. 2017; 36:706-09.

## DIARRHEA AND MALABSORPTION

- Does diarrhea equate to malabsorption?
- Wierdsma et al. Crit Care 2011 (pilot study)
- Validate the diagnostic accuracy of fecal weight as a biomarker for fecal loss
- Assess fecal macronutrient contents
- Stool from 48 patients analyzed
- 10 with $>350$ grams/day; 38 with $<350$ grams/day
- More than 350 grams/day feces was statistically significantly associated with an energy-absorption coefficient of less than $85 \%$

--- page 10 ---

# FIBER AND DIARRHEA 

- Multiple small studies have demonstrated improvement in diarrhea
- Meta-analysis of aggregated data (over 400 subjects) in 17 studies
- No difference in diarrhea in ICU patients receiving dietary fiber
- Reduced diarrhea in non-ICU patients receiving dietary fiber
- Short chain fructo-oligo saccharides may contribute to diarrhea (FODMAP's)
- Especially in those receiving antibiotics impacting intestinal microbiota
- Highly osmotic

McClave SA et al. JPEN J Parenter Enteral Nutr. 2016; 40:159-211.

## ANTI-DIARRHEAL AGENTS

- Once Clostridum difficile ruled out
- Loperamide
- Directly acts on the circular and longitudinal muscles of the intestinal wall to slow motility
- Inhibits fluid and electrolyte secretion and/or increase water absorption
- $2-4 \mathrm{mg}$ for each loose stool (or four times daily)
- Max of $16 \mathrm{mg} /$ day
- Greater effectiveness with scheduled doses
- Clinical improvement within 48 hours

--- page 11 ---

# ANTI-DIARRHEAL AGENTS 

- Diphenoxylate
- Acts locally and centrally on the smooth muscle cells of the GI tract to inhibit GI motility and slow excess GI propulsion
- $2.5-5 \mathrm{mg}$ four times daily
- Maximum of $20 \mathrm{mg} /$ day
- Discontinue with clinical improvement
- Tincture of Opium
- Inhibits peristalsis through opioid receptor stimulation in the GI tract
- $3-6 \mathrm{mg}$ one to four times/day
- Maximum of $24 \mathrm{mg} /$ day

Btaiche I et al. Nutr Clin Pract. 2010; 25:32-49.

## CONSTIPATION

- Difficult to define
- Normal defecation patterns vary
- Dependent on residue and absorption of enteral formula
- Clinical definition
- Accumulation of excess waste in the colon, often up to the transverse colon or even the cecum
- Causes
- Dehydration
- Inadequate or excessive dietary fiber
- Stool softener or cleansing enema maybe considered

--- page 12 ---

# CONSTIPATION 

- Addition of fiber to enteral regimen
- Insoluble module or mixed fiber enteral formula
- May need additional fluid to facilitate regular stool output
- Minimum of 1 mL fluid per enteral calorie intake
- Incidence in critically ill patients
- Observational study in 106 ICU patients ( $>3$ days admission)
- Lack of bowel movement for 3 consecutive days
- 70\% experienced constipation
- Early enteral feedings reduced risk of constipation by $16 \%$ ( $p<0.01$ )

Seres DS et al. Clin Nutr. 2017; 36:706-09.
Nassar AP et al. J Crit Care. 2009; 24(4):630-e9.

## ASPIRATION AND ENTERAL FEEDINGS

- Aspiration is the inhalation of material into the airway
- Assumption that pneumonia can develop from aspiration of enteral feeding
- Relationship between enteral feedings and aspiration is associative
- Progression from aspiration to pneumonia depends on the quantity and the acidity of the formula
- Aspiration pneumonia may account for 5\% to 15\% of pneumonia in hospitalized patients
- Incidence of gastric contents in tracheal secretions: $22 \%$ to $31 \%$

--- page 13 ---

# ASPIRATION RISK FACTORS 

- Low HOB elevation
- Gastric feedings
- Low GCS
- Gastro-esophageal reflux disease
- Use of paralytic agents
- High sedation levels
- Feeding tube malposition
- Transportation within the hospital
- Inadequate nursing staff

McClave SA et al. JPEN J Parenter Enteral Nutr. 2016; 40:159-211.

## GASTRIC RESIDUAL VOLUME ASPIRATION RISK MARKER?

- Historical use of measuring gastric volume during feeding
- Highly subjective
- Not physiologically sound
- Often leads to underfeeding
- Accuracy influenced by many factors
- Tube diameter
- Location of the tube's openings
- Patient positioning
- Skill of the clinician

--- page 14 ---

# GRV COMPARISON WITH ABDOMINAL EXAM \& RADIOLOGY 

![img-1.jpeg](images/c8ed6bd8ccfbfe1d.png)

Physical Exam
![img-2.jpeg](images/dc2944d84c27d609.png)

Medominal Radiograph

- Physical exam findings correlate to radiographic findings ( $p=0.016$ )
- GRV failed to correlate with physical exam or radiology findings

McClave SA et al. JPEN J Parenter Enteral Nutr. 1992; 16:99-105.

## GASTRIC RESIDUAL VOLUMES

![img-3.jpeg](images/ecce29c096a37222.png)

- Suggest that GRVs not be used as part of routine care to monitor ICU patients receiving EN (L)
- Those ICUs where GRVs are still utilized, holding EN for GRVs $<500 \mathrm{~mL}$ in the absence of other signs of intolerance should be avoided (L)-ASPEN/SCCM 2016 Critical Care Nutrition Guidelines

--- page 15 ---

# PRACTICE ALERT 

- Maintain HOB 30'- 45 unless contraindicated
- Use sedatives sparingly
- Assess feeding tube placement every 4 hours
- Observe for change in external tube
- Assess GI tolerance every 4 hours
- Assess GRV's and abdominal status
- Avoid bolus feedings for those at high aspiration risk

Metheny, NA. Critical Care Nurse. 2016; 36(1):e20-e24.

## ASPIRATION PREVENTION

## ASPEN/SCCM Critical Care Nutrition Guidelines:

- Mechanical ventilation
- Continuous infusion of sedatives
- Paralytic agents and inotropes
- High nasogastric output
- Gastric resection or altered gastric anatomy
- Severe gastroparesis or gastro esophageal reflux
- Supine position
- Neurological deficits or impaired level of consciousness
- Advanced age

McClave SA et al. JPEN J Parenter Enteral Nutr. 1992; 16:99-105.
"Recommend that the level of infusion be diverted lower in the GI tract in those critically ill patients at high risk for aspiration $(\mathrm{M} / \mathrm{H})$."

--- page 16 ---

# ASPIRATION PREVENTION 

- Monitor patients at least every 4 hours for positioning
- Minimize use of sedatives
- Monitor patient status for tolerance
- Abdominal distention or firmness
- High GRV's
- Bloating or nausea
- Monitor tube position at least every 4 hours
- Metheny, 2006 - 201 ICU patients
- 25 patients with malpositioned tubes after 3 days
- Significantly higher incidence of pneumonia

Metheny NA et al. Crit Care Med. 2006; 34:1007-15.

## MONITORING AND REASSESSMENT OF ENTERAL NUTRITION

- Monitoring schedules should be based on clinical status
- EN intolerance in ICU likely to occur 1-3 days following initiation
- Nutrition risk assessment will likely dictate monitoring schedule

Reasons for Intolerance in Blaser Study ( $n=576$ ):

- Abdominal distention ( $n=96$ )
- Subjective discomfort ( $n=46$ )
- Vomiting/emesis or diarrhea ( $n=211$ )
