- Intestinal Failure: Inadequate absorptive capacity for sustenance


## SELF-ASSESSMENT \#1

SG is admitted to the intensive care unit with a severe intra-abdominal infection following an intestinal resection for Crohn's disease. He is hemodynamically unstable and requires mechanical ventilation due to poor oxygenation of vital organs and tissues. What would be the best approach to nutrition support in this condition?
A. Initiate enteral feeding as soon as possible
B. Initiate parenteral nutrition until enteral feeding access can be obtained
C. Nutrition is not an issue in this patient
D. Withhold nutrition support until the patient stabilizes (within 24-48 hours)

--- page 4 ---

# SELF-ASSESSMENT \#2 

SM is admitted to the intensive care unit with severe acute pancreatitis. What nutrition approach could potentially attenuate the systemic inflammatory response thereby reducing the risk of complications and mortality?
A. Initiate enteral feeding as soon as possible
B. Initiate parenteral nutrition until enteral feeding access can be obtained
C. Nutrition is not an issue in this patient
D. Withhold nutrition support until the patient stabilizes (within 24-48 hours)

## INFLAMMATION

- Inflammation is common to diseases requiring nutrition support and predispose to malnutrition via:
- Anorexia, altered intake
- Increased nutrient losses - gastrointestinal disorders
- Nausea, vomiting
- Fistulas - abnormal communication with two or more organs
- Gastroduodenal - stomach to duodenum
- Nutrient intake may be adequate but poor utilization due to:
- Hyper- or altered metabolism

# METABOLIC RESPONSE TO INJURY 

| Physiologic Function | Response | Nutritional consequence |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Energy expenditure | $\uparrow \uparrow \uparrow$ | Expenditure in excess of energy intake creating Energy deficit |
| Catabolism - protein breakdown | $\uparrow \uparrow \uparrow$ | Breakdown in excess of intake or synthesis creating $\downarrow$ in LBM |
| Protein synthesis | No Change or $\uparrow$ | Change out of proportion with catabolism |

## METABOLIC RESPONSE TO INJURY

| Physiologic Function | Response | Nutritional consequence |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Ureagenesis (protein waste) | $\uparrow \uparrow$ | Limited tolerance to protein doses required to offset protein catabolism |
| Gluconeogenesis | $\uparrow \uparrow \uparrow$ | Glucose difficult to control, creates worse outcomes from illness |
| Response to feeding | $\downarrow \downarrow$ | Nutritional response dictated by injury response - use nutrients as fuel and healing injury rather than sustaining LBM |

# RELATIONSHIP OF INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE AND NUTRITION 

![img-1.jpeg](images/fdca67f5a6069e0e.png)

## CRITICAL CARE AND SURGERY

- Marked elevation of energy expenditure, protein catabolism and mobilization of fat for use as an energy source
- Predisposition to hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia and azotemia
- Poor tolerance to nutrition support
- Metabolic support - provide enough substrate to prevent nutrient deficiency or protein/calorie malnutrition until the patient stabilizes and may better utilize infused nutrients
- Accentuated loss of LBM and shortened time to develop malnutrition

--- page 7 ---

# CRITICAL CARE 

- Severe sepsis - shock
- Dysautoregulation or aberrant metabolism where infusion of nutrients may be harmful
- Clinical application: withhold or withdraw nutrition support
- Unstable ICU patient unable to maintain blood pressure or tissue oxygenation
- Hold nutrition support (EN, PN) during major operative procedures
- Acute emergency requiring resuscitation (code)
- Discontinue EN/PN until condition stabilizes

Martindale RG et al. The ASPEN adult nutrition support core
NUTRITION SUPPORT
curriculum. 3rd ed. 2017:458-59.

## CRITICAL CARE

- Important to recognize transition of care responsibilities when patient moves to or from critical care
- Assume there is a change in the requirement for calories and protein as well as the proportion of calories from carbohydrate, lipid and protein
- Likely increased when transfer to and decreased when discharged from critical care

--- page 8 ---

# CANCER CACHEXIA (PROGRESSIVE INVOLUNTARY WEIGHT LOSS) 

- Metabolic abnormalities
- Carbohydrate
- Protein
- Fat
- Clinical Features
- Tissue wasting
- Anorexia
- Skeletal muscle atrophy
- Anergy
- Fatigue
- Anemia
- Hypoalbuminemia


## CANCER CACHEXIA, CONT.

- Causes
- Anorexia
- Mechanical factors affecting the GI tract from tumors
- Side effects of surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy
- Alterations in intermediary and energy metabolism
- Changes in host cytokine and hormonal milieu
- Lean Body Mass = Survival

--- page 9 ---

# CANCER: PREVALENCE OF MALNUTRITION 

- $50 \%$ of patients with cancer present with weight loss at diagnosis
- Unintentional weight loss depletes the LBM
- Weight loss correlates with decreased performance status and survival following chemotherapy

| Characteristic | \% Wt Loss | Type of Cancer |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Lowest | $31-40$ | Sarcoma, breast, hematologic |
| Intermediate | $54-64$ | Colon, prostate, lung |
| Highest | $>80$ | Pancreas, gastric |

Dewys WD et al. Am J Med. 1980; 69(9):491-97.

## MALNUTRITION IN CANCER

- Affected by:
- Tumor type, location, grade and stage
- Anticancer treatment
- Patient characteristics
- Age, gender
- Comorbidities: diabetes, intestinal disorders
- Associated with longer hospital stay, $\uparrow$ cost and $\uparrow$ morbidity/mortality

--- page 10 ---

# NUTRITION SUPPORT IN CANCER: ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS 

- Due to metabolic abnormalities present in cancer patients, the use of nutrition support in those who no longer respond to cancer treatment usually becomes an ethical issue concerning withholding or withdrawing therapy
- Benefits versus Risk
- Patient - family considerations
- Social situation versus medical benefit
- Informed consent

Schwartz DB et al. The ASPEN adult nutrition support core curriculum. 3rd ed. 2017:785-804.

## ACUTE PANCREATITIS

- Disease progression and phases
- Inflammatory process initiated by intra-acinar activation of proteolytic enzymes causing auto digestion of the pancreatic gland.
- Local or systemic presence of disease relevant to prognosis
- An acute inflammatory reaction involving cytokines
- Initial phase is local and presents as abdominal pain
- Systemic phase induced by the inflammatory response develops over 13 days
- Severity of this phase (SIRS) influences the outcome of acute pancreatitis

--- page 11 ---

# OVERVIEW OF NUTRITION IN PANCREATITIS 

- Severe Acute Pancreatitis usually requires nutrition support
- Disease manifestations complicate the delivery, utilization and beneficial effects of nutrients
- Barriers to implementing best practices for nutrition in pancreatitis
- 'GUT' rest
- Recommendations for specific enteral tube placement
- Metabolic complications of nutrition therapy
- Therapeutic Objectives
- Attenuate Inflammatory response
- Prevent or treat malnutrition


## NUTRITION MANAGEMENT IN SAP

- Metabolic disturbances are common in pancreatitis
- Hyperglycemia - 40-90\%
- Hypertriglyceridemia - 12-15\%
- Hypocalcemia - present due to reduced parathyroid function, increased calcitonin levels, reduced magnesium and possibly saponification with unabsorbed free fatty acids in the GI

--- page 12 ---

# NUTRITION SUPPORT IN SEVERE ACUTE PANCREATITIS 

- 'GUT' rest and NPO is no longer considered the primary treatment.
- PN should be avoided and only used if EN is not feasible
- Persistent gastric ileus or small bowel obstruction and enteral access not possible
- Exacerbation of pancreatic symptoms despite nasojejunal delivery and use of elemental formula
- Gastrointestinal intolerance - abdominal pain, ascites, elevated pancreatic fistula output


## SHORT BOWEL SYNDROME

Surgical Resection

- SB length
- 100-120 cm without a colon
- 50 cm with colon
- Etiology
- Crohn's
- Volvulus
- Trauma
- Malignancy
- Radiation enteritis

--- page 13 ---

# CLINICAL CONSEQUENCES OF SBS 

- Jejunal resection of 50-60\% well tolerated
- $>30 \%$ ileal resection poorly tolerated
- Severe malabsorption with residual bowel $<60 \mathrm{~cm}$
- Deficiencies fluid and electrolytes
- Severe fluid and electrolyte loss with end jejunostomy
- $\mathrm{Mg}, \mathrm{Ca}, \mathrm{Zn}$ deficiencies are common


## NUTRITIONAL ISSUES

- Need for long-term and often life-time nutrition support with parenteral nutrition or combined oral/parenteral nutrition
- Nutrition assessment must be comprehensive with an awareness of increased probability of nutritional deficiencies
- Transitions of care are important when patient moves between healthcare settings (hospital - home, extended care facility, or ICU - general ward, home or extended care facility to hospital or ICU)
- For home parenteral nutrition patients with central venous catheter infections and prolonged periods of no nutrition due to loss of venous access, electrolyte, acid-base and/or micronutrient deficiencies are likely

# CONCLUSIONS 

- Inflammation is common to all disease states which predisposes to malnutrition and impedes the response to nutrient administration
- Individual diseases may elicit unique contributions to the development of malnutrition that require recognition and adjustments to the nutrition care plan
- Certain conditions where nutrition may not be as beneficial and risk is high may warrant either withholding or withdrawing nutrition support
