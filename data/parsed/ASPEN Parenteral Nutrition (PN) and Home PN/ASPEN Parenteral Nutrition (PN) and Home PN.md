  - 3.4 kcal/gram
  - pH ranging from 3.5 – 6.5

--- page 14 ---

# Protein Provision

- Necessary for synthesis of structural protein, growth, enzymatic function
- Amino acid solution (crystalline)
- 4 kcal/gram
- Acetate or chloride load from AA solution
- Assumed to be 16% nitrogen
- 6.25g protein = 1g nitrogen

|  Generation of ILE^{1} | Description | Rationale for design | Other potential benefits  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  First | Single-oil formulation using either SO or safflower oil^{2} | Source of EFA and energy | Compatibility information available with commonly used medications^{16}  |
|  Second | Two-oil formulation including SO and MCT^{6} | Lower SO content | Reducing the ω-6 FA content^{7}  |
|   |  |  | More stable ILE product with MCT oil^{17}  |
|   |  |  | MCTs accumulate less in adipose tissues and liver and are cleared faster with minimal peroxidation^{18}  |
|   |  |  | MCTs do not produce proinflammatory mediators^{18}  |
|  Third | Two-oil ILE using SO and OO, resulting in a reduced amount of EFA (ω-6 FAs) | Reduce SO content but still provide enough EFA | Higher amounts of monounsaturated FAs have a lower amount of peroxides produced during oxidation than PUFAs  |
|   |  |  | Oleic acid in OO is not metabolized to mediators of inflammation and immunity  |
|   |  |  | Potentially well suited for patients who are at risk of immune suppression or are immune compromised^{18}  |
|  Fourth | Four-oil ILE including SO, MCT, OO, and FO | Designed to include an optimal level of ω-6 to ω-3 FAs and includes FO and OO | Lower ratio of ω-6 to ω-3 FA (reduced SO dose)  |
|   |  |  | FO included for critically ill and surgical patient populations  |
|   |  |  | OO may be beneficial in those with immune disorders  |
|   | FO | Source of FAs and energy in infants and children with IFALD | May reverse IFALD  |

# PN Osmolarity

- Provides limits for safe administration of peripheral PN
- Peripheral < 900 mOsm/L
- Central > 900 mOsm/L

## PN Osmolarity

|  PN Component | mOsm  |
| --- | --- |
|  Amino Acids | $1 \mathrm{~g}=10 \mathrm{mOsm}$  |
|  Dextrose | $1 \mathrm{~g}=5 \mathrm{mOsm}$  |
|  IV Lipid Emulsion | $1 \mathrm{~g}=0.71 \mathrm{mOsm}$  |
|  Electrolytes | $1 \mathrm{mEq}=1 \mathrm{mOsm}$  |

- REMEMBER this is an estimate base on the osmolarity of the PN components
- ILE osmolarity is product dependent

--- page 21 ---

# Question 1 

1 LPN is compounded with the following content:

- Amino acid -60 g
- Dextrose - 170 g
- 20\% ILE - 20 g
- Electrolytes - 243 mEq

What is the estimated osmolarity?
a) $1607 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$
b) $1707 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$
c) $1807 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$
d) $1907 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$

## Question 1

Answer b) $1707 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$

Amino acid $60 \mathrm{~g} \times 10 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{g}=600 \mathrm{mOsm}$
Dextrose $170 \mathrm{~g} \times 5 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{g}=850 \mathrm{mOsm}$
ILE $20 \mathrm{~g} \times 0.71 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{g}=14.2 \mathrm{mOsm}$
Electrolytes $243 \mathrm{mEq} \times 1 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{mEq}=243 \mathrm{mOsm}$
$600 \mathrm{mOsm}+850 \mathrm{mOsm}+14.2 \mathrm{mOsm}+243 \mathrm{mOsm}=1707.2 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$

--- page 22 ---

# Initiating PN 

- Dextrose
- Provides $\sim 50 \%$ of total calorie intake or $60-85 \%$ of NPC
- Most PN will have goal doses of $150-350 \mathrm{~g} /$ day
- Initiate at roughly $1 / 2$ of goal dextrose
- $150-200 \mathrm{~g} /$ day (general population)
- $100-150 \mathrm{~g} /$ day (h/o DM or stress hyperglycemia)
- Advance to goal when BG controlled and electrolytes and acid base status stabilized
- Optimal glucose infusion rate $3-5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{min}$ (stressed, hospitalized)
- Reserve $6 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{min}$ in non-stressed, looking for weight gain
- Maximum $7 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day

31

## Initiating PN

- Protein
- Minimal metabolic effects
- Can initiate at goal
- Caution with azotemia (BUN > $100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ )
- Fat (ILE)
- $15-30 \%$ total calories
- Can estimate dose based on body weight
- $<1-2 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day
- Do not exceed $2.5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day
- To prevent EFAD (100 g weekly SO-ILE)
- Give 20\% ILE 250 mL twice weekly or 500 mL weekly
- This is important during shortages

--- page 23 ---

# Question 2 

A 3-in-1 TPN is compounded with the following:

- 440 mL of $15 \%$ Clinisol®
- 340 mL of $70 \%$ Dextrose
- 100 mL of $20 \%$ ILE

How much protein is provided per day?
a) 60 grams/day
b) 66 grams/day
c) 70 grams/day
d) 76 grams/day

## Question 2

Answer b) 66 grams

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{15 \mathrm{~g}}{100 \mathrm{~mL}}=\frac{\mathrm{x}(\mathrm{~g})}{440 \mathrm{~mL}} \\
& 100 \mathrm{x}=15 \times 440 \\
& \mathrm{x}=\frac{6600}{100} \\
& \mathrm{x}=66 \text { grams }
\end{aligned}
$$

# Question 3 

A 3-in-1 TPN is compounded with the following:

- 440 mL of $15 \%$ Clinisol
- 340 mL of $70 \%$ Dextrose
- 100 mL of $20 \%$ ILE

How many total calories are provided per day?
a) 1153 kcal
b) 1173 kcal
c) 1273 kcal
d) 1373 kcal

## Question 3

Answer c) 1273 kcal

$$
\begin{aligned}
& 66 \text { grams Protein } \times 4 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{gram}=264 \mathrm{kcal} \\
& \begin{array}{c}
\frac{70 \mathrm{~g} \text { dextrose }}{100 \mathrm{~mL}}=\frac{\mathrm{x}(\mathrm{~g} \text { dextrose })}{340 \mathrm{~mL}} \\
100 \mathrm{x}=23800 \\
\mathrm{x}=238 \mathrm{~g} \text { dextrose } \\
238 \mathrm{~g} \text { dextrose } \times 3.4 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{gram}=809 \mathrm{kcal}
\end{array} \\
& 100 \mathrm{~mL} \text { ILE } \times 2 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mL}=200 \mathrm{kcal}
\end{aligned}
$$

264 protein kcal +809 dextrose kcal +200 ILE kcal $=1273$ total daily kcal

- "ramp up and down"
- Prevents hyper- and hypoglycemia
- Cycling improves QOL
- May alleviate PNALD


## Monitoring

- Fluid balance
- Daily weights, I/Os
- Acid-base status
- Visceral proteins?
- C-reactive protein
- APR that marks inflammation

# Executive Summary

- Serum albumin and prealbumin are not components of currently accepted definitions of malnutrition.
- Serum albumin and prealbumin do not serve as valid proxy measures of total body protein or total muscle mass and should not be used as nutrition markers.
- The serum concentrations of albumin and prealbumin decline in the presence of inflammation, regardless of underlying nutrition status.
- Serum albumin and prealbumin declines must be recognized as inflammatory markers associated with "nutrition risk" in the context of nutrition assessment rather than with malnutrition per se. Nutrition risk is broadly defined as the risk of developing malnutrition and/or poor clinical outcomes if nutrition support is not provided.
- The role of serum albumin and prealbumin in monitoring delivery and efficacy of nutrition support remains undefined. Their normalization may indicate the resolution of inflammation, the reduction of nutrition risk, a transition to anabolism, or potentially lower calorie and protein requirements.

[^0]Table 6. ASPEN Consensus Recommendations for Avoidance and Treatment of RS in At-Risk Adults.

| Aspect of Care | Recommendations |
| :--: | :--: |
| Initiation of calories | - Initiate with $100-150 \mathrm{~g}$ of dextrose or $10-20 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{dk} \mathrm{g}$ for the first 24 hours; advance by $33 \%$ of goal every 1 to 2 days. This includes enteral as well as parenteral glucose. <br> - In patients with moderate to high risk of RS with low electrolyte levels, holding the initiation or increase of calories until electrolytes are supplemented and/or normalized should be considered. <br> - Initiation of or increasing calories should be delayed in patients with severely low phosphorus, potassium, or magnesium levels until corrected. <br> - Calories from IV dextrose solutions and medications being infused in dextrose should be considered in the limits above and/or initiated with caution in patients at moderate to severe risk for RS. If a patient has received significant amounts of dextrose for several days, from maintenance IV fluids and/or medications in dextrose, and has been asymptomatic with stable electrolytes, calories from nutrition may be reintroduced at a higher amount than recommended above. |
| Fluid restriction | - No recommendation. |
| Sodium restriction | - No recommendation. |
| Protein restriction | - Check serum potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus before initiation of nutrition. |
| Electrolytes | - Monitor every 12 hours for the first 3 days in high-risk patients. May be more frequent based on clinical picture. <br> - Restrict low electrolytes based on established standards of care. <br> - No recommendation can be made for whether prophylactic dosing of electrolytes should be given if prefeeding levels are normal. <br> - If electrolytes become difficult to correct or drop precipitously during the initiation of nutrition, decrease calories/grams of dextrose by $50 \%$ and advance the dextrose/calories by approximately $33 \%$ of goal every 1-2 days based on clinical presentation. Recommendations may be deemed based on practitioner judgment and clinical presentation, and cessation of nutrition support may be considered when electrolyte levels are severely and/or life-threateningly low or dropping precipitously. |
| Thiamin and multivitamins | - Supplement thiamin 100 mg before feeding or before initiating dextrose-containing IV fluids in patients at risk. <br> - Supplement thiamin 100 mg/d for 5-7 days or longer in patients with severe starvation, chronic alcoholism, or other high risk for deficiency and/or signs of thiamin deficiency. <br> - Routine thiamin levels are unlikely to be of value. <br> - MVI is added to PN daily, unless contraindicated, as long as PN is continued. For patients receiving oral/enteral nourishment, add complete oral/enteral multivitamin once daily for 10 days or greater based on clinical status and mode of therapy. <br> - Recommend vital signs every 4 hours for the first 24 hours after initiation of calories in patients at risk. <br> - Cardiorespiratory monitoring is recommended for unstable patients or those with severe deficiencies, based on established standards of care. <br> - Daily weights with parenteral intake and output. <br> - Evaluate short- and long-term goals for nutrition care daily during the first several days until the patient is deemed stabilized (eg, no requirement for electrolyte supplementation for 2 days) and then based on institutional standards of care. |

# Managing PN Associated Liver Complications

- **Rule out non-PN factors**
  - Medications, herbal supplements, biliary obstruction, hepatitis
- **Consider PN modifications**
  - Decrease dextrose, decrease ILE, balanced calories, cycle PN infusion
- **Maximize enteral intake**
  - Encourage oral intake if possible, slow rate EN
- **Treat SIBO**
  - Enteral antibiotics
- **Pharmacotherapy**
  - Ursodiol, antihistamines
- **Intestinal transplantation**

# Hypertriglyceridemia 

- Can occur with dextrose overfeeding or rapid ILE administration rates
- Review risk factors increasing intolerance
- Disease states, medications
- Hold ILE if Serum TG > $400 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$
- Fat intolerant - reduce ILE
- $<30 \%$ of total calories or $1 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day
- Can administer twice weekly


## Essential Fatty Acid Deficiency (EFAD)

- At risk patients
- ILE free PN > 2 - 4 weeks
- Poor nutritional status
- Manifestations
- Scaly dermatitis, alopecia, poor wound healing, thrombocytopenia
- Triene to tetraene ratio of more than 0.2
- How to avoid
- $1-2 \%$ of energy should be from linoleic acid
- $0.5 \%$ of energy should be from linolenic acid
- 20\% SO ILE 250 mL twice a week
- Trial topical safflower oil in those intolerant to ILE

# Medicare Coverage for Home PN 

- September 2021 new Local Coverage Determination (LCD)
- Prosthetic Device Benefit within the Durable Medical Equipment benefit
- PN is covered for beneficiaries who qualify under the Prosthetic Device Benefit defined in the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 15, Section 120

--- page 39 ---

|  Considerations | Yes | No  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  1. Does the patient require home PN for a long and indefinite duration? |  |   |
|  Has this been documented clearly in the medical record by the treating practitioner prior to discharge? |  |   |
|  2. Daily PN is considered reasonable and necessary for a patient with severe pathology of the alimentary (GI) tract which does not allow absorption of sufficient nutrients to maintain weight and strength commensurate with the patient's general condition. |  |   |
|  Does the medical record provide clear documentation that supports this? |  |   |
|  3. Has the treating practitioner documented in the medical record that enteral nutrition has been considered and ruled out, tried and been found ineffective, or that EN exacerbates gastrointestinal tract dysfunction? |  |   |
|  4. Does the home PN prescription provide 20–35 calories/kg/day? |  |   |
|  If NO: has the treating practitioner documented in the medical record the medical necessity for a caloric intake outside this range? |  |   |
|  5. Does the home PN prescription provide 0.8–2.0 gm/kg/day of protein, dextrose concentration above 10%, and lipid use as prescribed in the FDA approved dosing information? |  |   |
|  If NO: has the treating practitioner documented the medical necessity for protein orders outside of the range of 0.8–2.0 gm/kg/day, dextrose concentration less than 10%, or lipid use outside of the FDA approved dosing information? |  |   |

## Stability

- The degradation of nutritional components that change their original characteristics.
- Also, additives maintaining chemical integrity and pharmacologic activity.
- Maillard reaction - brown discoloration
- Photodegradation
- Vitamins

--- page 45 ---

# TNA Stability 

The following will compromise TNA stability.

Amino Acids

- Final concentration < 4\%

Dextrose

- Final concentration < 10\%

ILE

- Final concentration < 2\%

High cation concentrations

- More than $20 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ of divalent cations $(\mathrm{Ca}++$, Mg++)
- Addition of iron dextran

Admixture of dextrose with ILE
before adding amino acids

## Stability of ILE and TNA

- ILE consists of interior oil phase dispersed in external water phase
- There is a negative charge on the surface of the fat droplet
- When the charge becomes less negative, fat globules form that can lodge in the pulmonary vasculature
- $\mathrm{pH} 6-9$ is most favorable
- When pH is $<5$ or $>10$ this can cause cracking
- Monitor crystalline amino acid solution use
- Do not add concentrated dextrose directly to ILE
- Combine dextrose with amino acid first

--- page 46 ---

# Compatibility 

- Involved the formation of precipitates
- Most studies evaluate only physical compatibility
- Review physical compatibility charts (Y-site)
- This does not mean a medication can be added to PN


## Calcium and Phosphorus Stability

- Lower pH favors the more soluble monobasic calcium phosphate
- Calcium gluconate preferred
- L-cysteine can decrease pH
- Minimize large calcium doses
- Confirm doses > 2 times RDA
- Hypoalbuminemia, fluid status, acid-base status
- Add phosphate first, add calcium last
- Store refrigerated

## Visual Inspection

- 2 in 1 PN
- Able to see solid precipitates
- 3 in 1 PN
- Cracking
- Creaming
- Coalescence
- Aggregation

--- page 49 ---

|  Phase of Destabilization | Definition | Visual appearance | Consequences  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Aggregation (flocculation) | Process by which dispersed droplets come together but do not fuse | Particle size may be too small to visualize but may begin to reach the USP threshold | May be redispersed with gentle agitation and used safely  |
|  Creaming | Formation of a layer of aggregates at the emulsion surface | A translucent phase appearing at the bottom of the emulsion | May be redispersed with gentle agitation and used safely  |
|  Coalescence | A fusion of droplets leading to fewer droplets and increase in droplet size | Contains large droplets from 5 to 50 µm. Visualized as a presence of yellow-brown oil droplets at or near the TNA surface. Free oil may exist as individual spherical droplets or as segmented discontinuous oil layers | Cannot be fully redispersed. Unsafe to use  |
|  Oiling out (crack) | Coalescence continues to a point of complete separation—oily layer is seen at the top | Appears as a yellow-brown liquid at the surface of the TNA readily discernible from the remainder of the TNA; can be accompanied by marbling or streaking of the oil throughout the formula | Unsafe to use  |

D. All of the above
5. Question 5: Which of the following lipid injectable emulsions (ILE) contains the highest amount of phytosterol?
A. FO-ILE
B. OO-SO-ILE
C. SO-MCT-OO-FO-ILE
D. SO-ILE

# Learning Assessment Answers: 

1. Answer = False; Rationale: Peripheral PN is a short term option for the provision of nutrition support. It is limited by large amounts of fluids required to deliver adequate nutrition. Those who have significant malnutrition, severe metabolic stress, large nutrient needs, fluid restrictions, or the need for prolonged PN are not candidates for Peripheral PN.
2. Answer $=$ B; Rationale: Current recommendations state that ILE within a TNA should have a maximum hang time of 24 hours. Recommendations also state than ILE piggybacked into a 2-in-1 PN solution should have a maximum hang time of 12 hours. Tubing should also be changed every 12 hours when ILE is piggybacked with 2-in-1 PN. These recommendations also state that if ILE is to be infused separately over $>12$ hours, the dose should be divided into two parts with a new container and tubing every 12 hours.
3. Answer $=$ B; Rationale: To minimize extravasation and pheblitis risk, the recommended osmolarity limit for peripheral PN is $<900 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$.
4. Answer $=$ D; Rationale: TNA stability is compromised by the following: amino acid final concentration $<4 \%$, dextrose final concentration $<10 \%$, ILE final concentration $<2 \%$, high cation concentrations ( $\mathrm{Ca}++$, Mg , iron), and admixture of dextrose directly with ILE.
5. Answer $=$ D; Rationale: SO-ILE contains the highest amount of phytosterol when compared to the other ILEs available in the US market.
