# Calculating Fluid Requirements

- 65 year old male – 70 kg

|  **Holliday-Segar formula** | **Adjusted Holliday-Segar formula** | **Weight and age based formula**  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  100 mL/kg x 10 kg = 1000 mL | 1500 mL for first 20 kg | Since 65 years old,  |
|  50 mL/kg x 10 kg = 500 mL | Since > 50 year old, ADD | 30 mL/kg x 70 kg = 2100 mL/day  |
|  20 mL/kg x 50 kg = 1000 mL | 15 mL/kg x 50 kg = 750 mL | Divide by 24 hours for infusion rate  |
|  Add together = 2500 mL/day | Add together = 2250 mL/day |   |
|  Divide by 24 hours for infusion rate | Divide by 24 hours for infusion rate |   |

- Major extracellular cation functions in regulation of extracellular fluid volume, osmolarity and membrane potential of cells

Sodium Disorders

- Disorders are a result of alterations in water balance
- Hyponatremia
- Serum Na less than 135 mEq or mmol / Liter
- Common electrolyte disorder
- Hypernatremia
- Serum Na greater than 145 mEq or mmol / Liter
- Much less common

# Calculation of Water Deficit 70 kg male with a serum Na of 160mEq/L 

- Water deficit (L) $=$ TBW $\times[($ serum $\mathrm{Na}-140) / 140]$
$=70 \times 0.6[(160-140) / 140]$
$=42[20 / 140]$
$=6$ Liters
- TBW $=0.6 \times$ wt (males)
- Administer 50\% within first 24 hours, remainder over next 24-48 hours
- Can give as free water oral/enterally or hypotonic fluid intravenously (5\% dextrose, $0.2 \% \mathrm{NaCl}, 0.45 \% \mathrm{NaCl}$ )

Hypernatremia Management

# Fluids and Electrolytes 2025 

## Anne M. Tucker, PharmD, BCNSP

Clinical Pharmacy Specialist - Critical Care / Nutrition Support
The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX

## Disclosures

Consultant for Up To Date, Inc.

## Presentation Overview/Summary

Parenteral Nutrition (PN) management demands not only assessment and monitoring calorie and protein needs but also careful management of the patient's fluid and electrolytes. Water, sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphorus and magnesium are essential components on PN administration. Nutrition support clinicians must be aware of normal requirements and how to prevent and treat disorders related to fluids and electrolytes. Refeeding syndrome is a severe manifestation of altered electrolyte and mineral requirements that can occur with feeding severely malnourished patients and understanding of its pathophysiology will help to prevent adverse outcomes.

## Learning Objectives

At the conclusion of the presentation, the learner will be able to:

1. Assess fluid and electrolyte needs of a patient
2. Develop a therapeutic plan for fluid and electrolyte requirements
3. Prevent and manage complications of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities

## Key Takeaways/Fast Facts

- Body fluid composition correlates with muscle mass
- Hyponatremia is most commonly associated with an excess of intravascular fluid
- Hypo and hyperkalemia can affect the electrocardiogram
- Refeeding syndrome can lead to severe electrolyte disorders in patients at moderate to high risk.


## Learning Assessment Questions

1. Which of the following sodium concentrations ( $\mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ ) is the most appropriate choice to use when formulating a parenteral nutrition plan for a patient with high output ileostomy output?
a. 38.5 mEq sodium per Liter
b. 77 mEq sodium per Liter
c. 115 mEq sodium per Liter
d. 154 mEq sodium per Liter

--- page 49 ---

2. A patient presents with hypotonic hyponatremia and is currently on sertraline. What subtype of hyponatremia would you suspect?
a. Hypovolemic
b. Euvolemic
c. Hypervolemic
d. None of the above
3. Which of the following sodium concentrations ( $\mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ ) is the most appropriate choice to use when formulating a parenteral nutrition plan for a patient with SIADH?
a. 38.5 mEq sodium per Liter
b. 77 mEq sodium per Liter
c. 115 mEq sodium per Liter
d. 154 mEq sodium per Liter
4. Which of the follow is/are important considerations when ordering parenteral potassium supplementation?
a. Location of patient
b. Type of intravenous access
c. Renal function
d. All the above
5. Which of the following is used in the treatment of hyperkalemia with the mechanism of increased potassium elimination?
a. Furosemide
b. Calcium gluconate
c. Albuterol
d. Insulin
6. A patient is noted to have a serum magnesium of $1.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$. Serum creatinine is 2.2 $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$. What is an appropriate recommendation for magnesium sulfate IV?
a. Magnesium supplementation is not indicated
b. 16 mEq magnesium sulfate
c. 24 mEq magnesium sulfate
d. 48 mEq magnesium sulfate

# Learning Assessment Answers: 

1. Answer $=$ D; Since ileostomy output is isotonic, the parenteral nutrition plan should be formulated to replace these losses which would be approximately normal saline concentration ( $\sim 154 \mathrm{mEq}$ sodium per Liter).
2. Answer $=\mathrm{B}$; Sertraline is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) which is a known drug class associated with SIADH, a type of euvolemic hypotonic hyponatremia.
3. Answer $=$ D; In SIADH, there are significant sodium losses in the urine and an inappropriate secretion of ADH relative to fluid status (euvolemia). It is recommended to formulate the parenteral nutrition as a concentrated formula (fluid restrict) and use approximately normal saline concentration ( $\sim 154 \mathrm{mEq}$ sodium per Liter).

4. Answer= D; All the above are considerations related to the ordering, compounding and administration of parenteral potassium to prevent untoward adverse effects.
5. Answer= A; Furosemide and other loop diuretics increase renal potassium elimination. Calcium works to stabilize the myocardium during hyperkalemia and does not have any effect on serum potassium levels. The other agents listed produce a reduction in potassium concentration through intracellular potassium shift (albuterol, insulin).
6. Answer= B; The patient has hypomagnesemia and renal impairment (serum creatinine $2.2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ). An accepted magnesium dose for normal renal function for a serum magnesium of 1-1.5 mEq/dL is 8-32 mEq (up to $1 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{kg}$ ). In patients with renal impairment, it is recommended to decrease the magnesium dose by $50 \%$ which would be 4-16 mEq (up to $0.5 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{kg}$ ).
