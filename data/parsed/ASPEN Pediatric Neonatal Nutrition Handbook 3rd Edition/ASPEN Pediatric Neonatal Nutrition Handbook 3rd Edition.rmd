# Preface 

The period from infancy through adolescence is a time of rapid growth and development filled with many critical milestones, which if missed, cannot be overcome. This rapid growth leads to higher metabolic needs. Nutrition plays an essential role in optimizing growth and developmental outcomes during these life stages, putting children at high risk for malnutrition.

To provide the best care for children, practitioners must know how to recognize malnutrition and identify children who are at risk to provide appropriate evidenced-based nutrition support for both prevention and treatment. There is no single parameter that reflects nutritional status. Therefore, nutrition support for pediatric patients requires comprehensive screening, assessment, intervention, and follow-up. It is important to recognize the complex and changing nature of nutrition and nutrition support in this young population and to understand the importance of timely assessment and clear communication between families, patients, and the health care team in all settings.

This handbook is divided into three sections to guide clinicians as they provide nutrition support-related care for neonates, infants, children, and adolescents. Part I, "Nutrition Status," outlines how to assess the nutritional status of neonatal and pediatric patients. Part II, "Nutrition Care Plan," addresses how to develop parenteral and enteral nutrition care plans for neonates, infants, children, and adolescents. Part III, "Disease-Specific Nutrition," reviews nutrition considerations for pediatric patients with acute and chronic illness.

--- page 24 ---

The handbook is meant to supplement the ASPEN Pediatric Nutrition Support Core Curriculum, ASPEN guidelines, and ASPEN position statements, so readers should refer to these resources for more in-depth discussions of covered topics.

# Nutrition Screening and History

## Overview

Nutrition assessment lies at the heart of the nutrition care process, which involves developing a nutrition diagnosis, creating a nutrition care plan, and monitoring progress. ${ }^{1}$ Nutrition assessment is the "systematic process of collecting and interpreting information to make decisions about the nature and cause of nutritionrelated health issues that affect an individual." ${ }^{2}$ Assessment of nutrition involves a detailed history of cooccurring medical conditions and clinical considerations, a meticulous history of the food intake pattern, anthropometric variables, monitoring growth and weight gain velocity, and appropriate laboratory evaluation. These factors are all incorporated into a nutrition diagnosis that defines the chronicity and cause of the nutrition problem. A nutrition intervention plan follows with a clear outline of the goals and establishes which parameters will be used to define a positive outcome. ${ }^{1}$

This chapter focuses on the nutrition assessment of infants and children, including ancillary conditions, factors, and indicators that come into play when assessing a child's nutrition and diagnosing malnutrition.

## Nutrition Screening

Nutrition "screening" and "assessment" are different processes. The former indicates risk factors for a nutrition condition and the latter provides the nutrition diagnosis. ${ }^{3}$ Nutrition risk screening should be completed upon presentation to all health care settings to ensure opportunities for remediation of malnutrition are not lost.

--- page 27 ---

Early identification of nutrition risk facilitates timely nutrition intervention, potentially limiting malnutrition-related complications. Nutrition screening is an important preliminary step that identifies the risk of a nutrition problem. Nutrition screening also initiates entry into the nutrition care process. It identifies the need for additional nutrition assessment and the need for referral to a registered dietitian (RD) for a potential diagnosis of nutrition-related problem(s).

Nutrition screening tools are used to identify the risk of malnutrition or change in the risk of malnutrition, which can occur during periods of illness. Nutrition screening tools should make screening quick and easy to complete. They should allow the process to be completed by staff without formal nutrition training. The most common parameters included in the tools to identify malnutrition risk are the following:

- Appetite or dietary intake
- Clinical information, such as the presence of a medical condition that impacts nutrition status or medical treatment
- One or more anthropometric measures and/or concerns about weight or growth ${ }^{4}$

Nutrition screening tools that have demonstrated moderate to high validity, reliability, and agreement are preferred. The use of tools that have low or undemonstrated validity and reliability may result in missing individuals at risk for malnutrition. It may also result in referral for nutrition assessments for those who are not at risk.

Tools used to identify malnutrition risk should be valid and reliable for the population and setting. Although no screening tool can be $100 \%$ accurate, pediatric nutrition screening tools should have at least moderate to high validity and reliability based on grade 1 (good/strong) or grade 2 (fair) evidence. Although there are gaps in validation for pediatric nutrition screening tools for use in the outpatient setting, simple tools such as the Pediatric Nutrition Screening Tool (PNST), ${ }^{5}$ which consists of 4 questions, can be used in these settings. ${ }^{4}$ Exhibit 1-1 lists the questions in the PNST and its scoring. ${ }^{5}$

EXHIBIT 1-1. Pediatric Nutrition Screening Tool Questions

| Questions | Yes | No |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Has the child lost weight unintentionally lately? |  |  |
| Has the child had poor weight gain over the past few months? |  |  |
| Has the child been eating/feeding less over the past few weeks? |  |  |
| Is the child obviously underweight? |  |  |
| Scoring: If yes to 2 or more of the above, refer the child for <br> - further nutrition assessment <br> - measurement of weight and length for height <br> - food or diet intake record |  |  |

There are several other tools besides the PNST that have moderate-to-high validation in the pediatric population in both acute care and ambulatory settings:

- Screening Tool for Assessment of Malnutrition in Pediatrics
- Screening Tool for Risk of Nutrition Status and Growth

# Nutrition Assessment and Interpretation 

Upon completion of the nutrition risk screen, children who are deemed to be at nutrition risk should be referred for further nutrition assessment. The purpose of nutrition assessment is to determine whether a nutrition problem or diagnosis exists and whether nutrition intervention is indicated. The nutrition assessment includes the following detailed data collection:

- The child's health and wellbeing
- The child's intake
- Anthropometric measures
- Weight gain and growth velocity and appropriate growth charts
- A nutrition-focused physical examination
- Laboratory evaluation


## Data for the Nutrition Assessment

The nutrition providers who complete the nutrition assessment should ensure that all available information pertaining to the child's nutrition status is reviewed as part of this process. There are several data sources for nutrition assessment:

- The health record
- Biochemical data
- Medical/surgical history
- Vital signs
- Medical procedures/consultations
- Medication
- Route of delivery
- Recorded anthropometric measurements/growth history

--- page 30 ---

- Data created during the assessment
- Client interview

- Mode of delivery
- Obtained anthropometric measurements

- Birth history
- Feeding history
- Developmental history
- Achievement of developmental milestones
- Social and family environment ${ }^{9}$

Assessing nutrition status enables health professionals from a variety of disciplines to identify whether children are growing appropriately or whether they are at risk of under- or overnutrition or inadequate growth or weight gain. See also chapter 3, "Clinical Considerations," "Feeding, Eating, and Drinking Difficulties, Including Swallowing Problems (Dysphagia)" section for specific questions related to children with eating and drinking difficulties.

# Diet Assessment Methods 

Assessing the adequacy and appropriateness of a child's nutrient intake is essential to nutrition assessment, and should include a comprehensive review of the key elements of the child's diet history.

## Key Elements of a Pediatric Diet History

The key elements of a pediatric diet history include the following:

- Type and amount of food, beverages, formula, and human milk consumed and route of intake
- Methods of food or formula preparation
- Feeding history/introduction of solids
- Meal/snack frequency/duration
- Use of/skill with eating utensils/cups
- Gastrointestinal function/gastroesophageal reflux, constipation
- Urinary output, quality/quantity
- Sleep schedule
- Caregiver/child interaction at meals/meal location/setting


## Approaches to Quantify Nutrient Intake

There are several approaches to quantify nutrient intake data:

- Diet history is designed to determine the pattern of usual food intake. This type of history queries the types and frequency of foods eaten and includes the intake of nutrition supplements. The diet history is generally a detailed interview conducted by a registered dietitian nutritionist. An estimate of nutrient intake can then be calculated from the collected data.

--- page 31 ---

- 24-hour recall provides an estimate of nutrient intake based on the child's or their caregiver's recollection of food consumed over the previous day. This method has been used successfully for groups of individuals; however, it is less valid in evaluating diet adequacy for an individual because the 24-hour period assessed may not represent the usual diet. Nutrient intakes calculated from 24-hour recalls may be lower than those based on dietary histories or food records. This method has many online applications for use with caregivers and older children. ${ }^{10}$
- 3-7 day food records provide prospective food intake data. These are recorded by the parent, child, or other caregiver. These types of records require literacy. They must be returned to the nutrition care provider for analysis. Food records encompassing 7 days may provide more accurate information than those of shorter duration, as they include both weekend and weekday meal patterns. However, accuracy of diet recordkeeping can deteriorate over time. When a 7-day food record is not possible, use of shorter time periods including selected days of the week is an alternative. ${ }^{11}$
- Nutrient intake analysis (calorie count) is frequently ordered in inpatient facilities to assess a child's food intake. These are used to determine a child's ability to consume enough food for growth or to verify the achievement and adequacy of a prescribed feeding regimen. These records, however, do not provide data representative of intake within the home environment.
- Food frequencies estimate the frequency and amounts of specific foods eaten. These often consist of questionnaires that can be self-administered and therefore reduce professional interview time. The questionnaire generally cannot retrieve unique details of an individual's diet unless designed to do so. Overreporting of food intake is common with this method. ${ }^{12,13}$ Table 1-2 outlines the advantages and disadvantages of food intake collection methods. ${ }^{14}$


# TABLE 1-2. Advantages/Disadvantages of Food Intake Collection Methods ${ }^{\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b}}$ 

| Data Collection <br> Method | Advantages | Disadvantages |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Diet record | - Intake quantified <br> - Does not require recall <br> - Provides typical food intake and <br> mealtime pattern information <br> - Requires repeated records for <br> accuracy | - Can influence and change <br> eating behavior <br> - High patient burden <br> - High staff cost and burden <br> - Requires patient literacy |
| 24-h recall | - Intake is quantified <br> - Does not influence eating behavior <br> - Low patient burden <br> - Does not require patient literacy | - High staff cost and burden <br> - Multiple recalls required for <br> accurate habitual intake <br> - High reliance of patient recall |
| Food frequency <br> questionnaire | - Low patient burden <br> - Does not alter eating behavior <br> - Low staff burden <br> - Captures habitual intake <br> - Does not reflect short term intake | - Relies on patient recall <br> - Requires patient literacy <br> - Not quantifiably precise <br> - Does not provide mealtime <br> pattern information |

# Nutrition Analysis Programs 

After a food or nutrition intake history is obtained, there are several options for performing a nutrient analysis. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference ${ }^{15}$ is a major source of food composition data in the United States and provides the foundation for most food composition databases in the public and private sectors. FoodData Central provides expanded nutrient data and links to related agricultural and experimental research. Other food analysis options include software programs that are available for purchase. Some of the most popular options for health professionals include the following:

- The USDA food and nutrient database (FoodData Central: https://fdc.nal.usda.gov)
- Food Processor (https://esha.com/products/food-processor)
- Nutritionist Pro (https://nutritionistpro.com)
- Nutrihand (https://www.nutrihand.com/Static/index.html)
- Information for families and caregivers regarding food and nutrition:
- "Nutrition Resources for Parents, Caregivers, and Teachers"
(https://www.nutrition.gov/topics/nutrition-age/teens/parents-caregivers-and-teachers)
- USDA MyPlate (https://www.myplate.gov)
- American Academy of Pediatrics (https://www.healthychildren.org/english/healthyliving/nutrition/pages/default.aspx)
- CalorieKing (for calories in common "fast foods" (https://www.calorieking.com)


## Assessing Intake in Infants

For infants who are exclusively breastfed, adequacy of intake is based on the duration of feeding, hydration status, and growth as reflected in weight gain velocity. Table 1-3 provides information based on age for infants who receive human milk at the chest. For information on how much to feed an infant, refer to the American Academy of Pediatrics website (https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/How-Often-and-How-Much-Should-Your-Baby-Eat.aspx). Table 13 outlines the approximate frequency of feedings and volumes, the urinary and stool output, and the expected weight gain per day or week. ${ }^{16}$

${ }^{\text {b }}$ First foods are generally pureed or blended single foods. Iron-containing foods such as infant cereal, legumes and meats should be offered first.

When discussing nutrient intake with caregivers, it is important to determine how the food and formula are prepared. Asking what product is used, how much is made, and how it is made can assist with the assessment of nutrient intake of the child. The following are examples of questions regarding infant and pediatric formula preparation:

- What is the name of the pediatric or infant formula the child is receiving?
- Is the formula being used as a ready-to-serve product?
- How and where is the formula prepared and stored?
- Is there a special recipe for mixing the formula or is it made as per can instructions?
- What is the exact recipe?
- How much water is used?
- How much powder or liquid concentrate is being used?
- Is water or powder added first?
- How much liquid concentrate is used and how much water is added?

--- page 34 ---

- Is anything else being added to the formula (eg, thickeners, medications, vitamins)?


# Anthropometric Measurement 

Anthropometric measures followed longitudinally are integral to the nutrition assessment. All anthropometric measurements are most useful as serial measurements, taken by the same person, whenever possible.

Weights, length, or height are standard measurements for all children. Head circumference should be measured in infants and children under 2 years of age. If the child has a head circumference that does not match the child's other parameters, the weight for length can be impacted. For example, a very small head circumference, as is seen in microcephaly, can skew the weight for height downward making a child who may be adequately nourished plot low on the weight-for-length curve. A plateauing head circumference can be an indicator of severe chronic malnutrition, as weight and length measurements are generally impacted before the head circumference plateaus. Each of the measurements must be compared with another measurement to see whether the child's weight is proportional to their length or height. Any anthropometric measurement in isolation does not provide valid information.

Mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC), triceps skinfold (TSF), and midarm muscle circumference are measurements used to evaluate body fat and muscle stores and thereby are proxies for body composition. These measurements are useful in further evaluating the nutrition status of infants and children who fall into a wasted or overweight status or who have altered body composition due to NI.

In children who are acutely ill, fluid shifts and edema may make the weight unreliable. In this situation, the MUAC and TSF are important indicators, as they are less sensitive to fluid shifts. In the critical care setting, MUAC may be a more sensitive indicator to identify acute malnutrition in children. ${ }^{17-22}$

## Measurement Techniques

Obtaining accurate anthropometric measurements is crucial to the assessment of the nutrition status of children. The use of the correct equipment and thorough training of personnel are essential to ensuring accurate measurements are performed. The following information provides guidelines for obtaining accurate measurements. Table 1-4 provides details on measuring anthropometrics in children and references values to use in the assessment of the values. ${ }^{23-27}$

# Segmental Measurements of Height in Children 

For children who are unable to stand or who have skeletal deformities because of underlying NI, segmental measures are validated for proxy measurements for height. ${ }^{24}$ Table 1-5 outlines the techniques for performing segmental measures and the equations for calculation of extrapolated height. ${ }^{24,26}$

--- page 41 ---

TABLE 1-5. Segmental Measurement Techniques and Equations to Calculate Extrapolated Lengths

| Measurement | Age | Equipment | Technique ${ }^{a}$ | Calculation |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Knee height $(\mathrm{KH})$ | All ages | KH calipers | With the child sitting, place the bottom blade of the caliper under the heel. With the knee and ankle joint at $90^{\circ}$, position the top blade of the caliper just behind the patella on the end of the femur. | The KH (in centimeters) is the distance between the blades of the caliper. <br> - For children up to 12 y with NI, use the following: Estimated height $=(2.69) \times \mathrm{KH}$ in $\mathrm{cm}+24.2^{b}$ <br> - For youth $>12 \mathrm{y}$, use age-specific formulas stratified by age and sex. ${ }^{\text {c }}$ |
| Tibial length (TL) | $2-12 y$ | Tape measure | The tibia is measured on the inside of the leg (medial side). With the child sitting or supine, find and mark the joint space between the tibia and the femur. Then mark the distal edge of the medial malleolus. | The TL is the distance between these points in centimeters: Estimated height $=3.26 \times$ TL in cm +30.8 |

| Arm span | All ages | Tape measure | - With the child recumbent lying on paper with horizontal lines or a measuring tape, the arms are positioned flat against the measuring tape/paper. The recorder pushes the elbows flat against the tapes. Measure the distance between the 2 middle fingers. <br> - Or, with the child standing, heels together, against a wall with lined paper, the arm span is measured with the arms straight and parallel to one of the horizontal lines on the paper; the distance between the tips of the middle fingers is measured. ${ }^{d}$ | - This can be used in children without shoulder or arm contractures. Arm span correlates strongly with length or height in children, but different equations are required for different ethnic populations for better height and arm span matches. <br> - Arm span and ulnar length are reliable and accurate estimates of recumbent length and height in a multiethnic population of infants and children under 6 y of age. ${ }^{\text {e }}$ |
| Upper arm length | All ages | Anthropometer | The child should be sitting up with their arm relaxed at their side. Measure from the lateral edge of the acromion to the head of the radius, which is the forearm bone on the side of the thumb. | Estimated stature in centimeters $=(4.35 \times$ upper arm length in cm$)+21.8^{b}$ |

# Interpreting Anthropometric Measurements 

Anthropometric measures are an integral part of the nutrition assessment. They allow comparison with other children's growth patterns through reference standards and are therefore important for assessing and monitoring nutrition goals.

## Interpreting Weight

Like any anthropometric measure, a weight cannot be interpreted without understanding how it compares with a child's other anthropometric measures and in the context of the child's health and nutrition history. method of understanding weight gain is to look at the weight gain velocity, which assesses whether a child is meeting weight gain goals for age compared with other children.

Table 1-6 demonstrates weight gain velocity at different percentiles and their approximate $z$ score equivalents on the World Health Organization (WHO) growth standards, ${ }^{18}$ whereas Tables 1-7 and 1-8 look at weight and height gain stratified by age and sex. ${ }^{18,28,29}$ See also chapter 2, "Malnutrition in Preterm Infants and Neonates" section

Recovery Growth. Recovery or "catch-up" growth can be seen when an acceleration in weight gain velocity occurs after a period of weight loss or poor weight gain. In general, recovery growth happens in a stepwise fashion of weight gain, MUAC gain, and, finally, height gain, a reverse of the order in which the losses occur.

# Interpreting Length and Height 

Well-nourished children who meet their nutrient needs should follow a stable growth trajectory on a percentile or $z$ score curve [see discussion of $z$ scores in "Use of $z$ Scores (SDs vs Percentiles)" section in this chapter]. Plotting a single data point allows the provider to compare the child's growth to the reference standard. When sequential plots are recorded, the child's growth trajectory can be described. Multiple recorded data points allow the child's growth to be tracked over time.

Although downward trends of height percentiles on growth charts can be indicators of poor nutrition status, height is also influenced by hereditary factors, and, therefore, in children aged 2-9 years, interpretation of the height status can be improved by assessing the midparental height. ${ }^{30}$

A child's height percentile before pubertal growth should fall within 2 SDs or 8.5 cm of midparental height, which is calculated as follows ${ }^{31}$ :

--- page 46 ---

Males: [(father's height in centimeters + mother's height
in centimeters) +13 ]/2
Females: [(father's height in centimeters + mother's height
in centimeters) -13 ]/2

Health and wellness, nutrition intake, and pubertal status all impact growth. A detailed chart of the assessment of pubertal status can be found in the ASPEN Pediatric Nutrition Support Core Curriculum. ${ }^{30}$ Pubertal development can also be classified by using a child and parent reporting algorithm (Pubertal Development Scale), ${ }^{32}$ which may be adequate for most applications for nutrition reasons. This tool compares favorably to traditional visual staging done according to the Tanner staging of puberty. ${ }^{33}$

# Interpreting Body Mass Index 

Body mass index (BMI) correlates with body fat, and a high BMI has been linked to future obesity. Age-related increases in BMI are associated with increases in fat mass and fat-free mass, depending on the age, sex, and pubertal maturation of the child. The BMI $z$-score for age is the recommended nutrition indicator to screen children ages 2 years and older to identify individuals who are underweight, overweight, or have obesity. To calculate BMI, use one of the following equations:

Weight in kilograms/height in meter squared
(Weight in kilograms/height in meters)/height in meters

BMI can be difficult to interpret in children who have skeletal deformities or are unable to stand because of NI, as height measurement errors are magnified by BMI calculation.

Comparing the weight and height by using weight for length or BMI plays an important role in assessing nutrition status and making a nutrition diagnosis. Table 1-9 outlines the WHO cutoff points for various nutrition states based on weight for length or BMI. The values are expressed in terms of $z$ scores, which are an expression of SDs above or below the mean in a normal distribution of values. ${ }^{34}$ [For a discussion of $z$ scores, see "Use of $z$ Scores (SDs vs Percentiles)" section in this chapter].

# Growth Charts 

Growth Charts for All Children. All anthropometric measures should be compared with appropriate reference standards. The WHO growth charts ${ }^{18}$ were developed by using measurements of children of many ethnic backgrounds. They demonstrate how children with access to good nutrition will grow when raised in environmental conditions favorable to growth. At under 24 months, growth should be analyzed with the WHO international growth standards for weight, length, weight for length, and head circumference, regardless of the feeding method. Healthy breastfed infants typically gain weight faster than healthy formula-fed infants during the first 34 months. Growth after 2 years of age should be monitored on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) growth reference charts published in 2000 for children in the United States, as these are national growth references. ${ }^{19}$ Some countries use the WHO growth charts for all ages. Exhibit 1-3 is a comparison of WHO and CDC growth charts and when to consider use of the growth standards and growth reference charts. ${ }^{18,19,34}$

EXHIBIT 1-3. Comparison of WHO and CDC Growth Charts
2006 WHO Child Growth Standards From Birth to 5 Years ${ }^{a}$

--- page 48 ---

- A growth standard defines a recommended "model" pattern of growth associated with specified health outcomes and minimization of long-term risks of disease. It represents the best description of physiologic growth for children from birth to 5 years.
- These prescriptive standards are based on term, singleton babies receiving optimal health care, with a nonsmoking mother, predominantly breastfed for at least 4 months, at least partially breastfed until 12 months, and with introduction of complementary foods between 4 and 6 months. Children that were excluded include preterm and very low birth weight infants $(<1500 \mathrm{~g})$.
- In addition, they are based on international sample population in 6 different countries (Brazil, Ghana, India, Norway, Oman, and the United States).


# 2007 WHO Growth Reference Charts From 5 to 19 Years ${ }^{b}$ 

- A growth reference describes the growth pattern of a defined population without making claims about health status.
- They are updated to address the obesity epidemic and are therefore closer to being considered growth standards than the CDC growth charts.
- Data fitted to an almost perfect match of measurements at 5 years of age between the growth standards and growth references. At 19 years of age, BMI for age at the 85th percentile (overweight) and the 97th percentile (obesity) match almost perfectly with adult cutoffs for BMI of 25 and 30, respectively.
- Set 1 of the WHO child growth standards and growth references includes the third, 15th, 50th, 85th, 97th, and 99.99th percentiles, which closely correspond to $z$ score cutoff points that define pediatric malnutrition.
- Set 2 of the WHO Child Growth Standards include the third, 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th and 97 th percentiles.


## 2000 CDC Growth Charts ${ }^{c}$

- The CDC growth charts represent the standard growth reference for American children describing how children grew in a particular place and time. The CDC recommends using the WHO growth charts before 2 years of age and using the CDC growth charts from 2 to 20 years.
- The clinical charts for infants and older children were published in 2 sets:
- Set 1 contains 10 charts ( 5 for boys and 5 for girls), which include the fifth, 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th, and 95th smoothed percentile lines for all charts and the 85th percentile for BMI for age and weight for stature.
- Set 2 contains 10 charts ( 5 for boys and 5 for girls), which include the third, 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th, and 97th smoothed percentile lines for all charts and the 85th percentile for BMI for age and weight for stature.

Specialized Growth Charts. Specialized growth charts are available for children with genetic or neurodevelopmental conditions; often, they are developed by using small historical samples that predate optimized nutrition care. Specialized growth charts should always be used together with standard WHO or CDC growth charts.

When assessing specialized growth charts, check the following:

- What are the sources of the data, sample size, and age of participants?
- How was the data collected?
- What measurements were collected?
- Are the curves "smoothed?"
- Are weights and heights collected appropriately?
- Was the information generated before treatment for the condition or nutrition support was available?

Trisomy 21 is the most common chromosomal variation. Growth charts have been developed and should be used to plot children with this genetic condition. Two trisomy 21 growth charts are in common usage. ${ }^{35,36}$

Cerebral palsy (CP) is a neuromuscular condition that affects motor function and tone. It is the most common of the neuromuscular/neurodevelopmental conditions, and it impacts motor functioning and is often used as a prototype for children with NI. Specific growth charts for children with CP are available online (see https://www.lifeexpectancy.org/articles/GrowthCharts.shtml), although their use is not without controversy, as they have not been clinically validated. They are representative of how a large cohort of children with CP grew but do not tell us how the children "should grow." They are descriptive, not prescriptive.

The CP-specific growth charts are stratified by sex, tube feeding, and functional severity by using the Gross Motor Function Classification Scale (GMFCS). By using the GMFCS, children can be classified according to their motor function before their second birthday to 18 years. ${ }^{37}$ Table 1-10 provides a brief description of GMFCS levels. Team members from disciplines not regularly using the GMFCS should rely on the disciplines on their teams for help with this classification to enable plotting on the CP growth charts. GMFCS level 5 is the only level stratified by tube feeding status.

--- page 50 ---

TABLE 1-10. Gross Motor Function Classification Scale for Children With Cerebral Palsy

| Level | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| 1 | Walks without limitations |
| 2 | Walks with limitations |
| 3 | Walks with hand-held mobility device |
| 4 | Self-mobility with limitations; may use powered mobility |
| 5 | Transported in a manual wheelchair |

ER_English.pdf

Plotting under the 20th percentile for weight for age on the CP growth charts places children in the "zone of concern," which is demarcated on the charts. Plotting in this region places children at increased risk of morbidity and mortality based on their nutrition status alone. Plotting above the zone of concern does not mean the child's nutrition has been optimized; it simply reflects how they plot with respect to other children similarly affected by motor impairment. Despite their limitations, these growth charts are valuable tools for discussions regarding nutrition rehabilitation with families and the possible need for a significant change in their child's nutrition care plan. ${ }^{38}$

# Interpreting Patterns of Growth 

The following scenarios trigger a deeper look into a child's nutrition and general health status:

- sharp inclines or declines in weight gain or growth,
- plateau of weight or growth percentiles or $z$ scores, and/or
- unexpected movement downward from a previously established growth pattern on weight or growth percentiles or $z$ scores.

Investigation of changes in weight and height should occur before a child has crossed 2 percentiles on a growth chart or has experienced a decline in BMI-for-age $z$ score or weight for length for age $z$ score of 2 . In the first $2-3$ years of life, children may cross percentiles as they are finding their own growth trajectory. ${ }^{39}$

## Use of z Scores (SDs vs Percentiles)

--- page 51 ---

Percentiles are commonly used and indicate the child's position within the context of the reference population (ie, when measurements are within the third and 97th percentiles [2 SDs]). Percentiles indicate what percentage of the population will be less than or greater than the individual being compared with the reference standard. This is a descriptive standard.

Values expressed as $z$ scores describe how far, in SDs or SD units, the child's measurement is from the mean (average). Values expressed as $z$ scores are more precise in describing anthropometric status than percentiles, as they compare actual numbers (vs percentiles).

The use of $z$ scores is beneficial when the child plots far from the expected growth percentiles on a standard growth chart. Changes in weight gain or growth may be seen more clearly when they are expressed as $z$ scores instead of percentiles. A $z$ score $<-2$ SDs indicates a growth pattern of concern requiring close monitoring and investigation.

Table 1-11 shows percentiles from set 1 of the WHO child growth standards and the corresponding $z$ score. This references percentiles that closely correspond to $z$ score cutoff points that define pediatric malnutrition. ${ }^{18,34}$

There are several mobile device and online applications that can be used to assist with nutrition assessments:

- PediTools Home (https://www.peditools.org and mobile app)
- WHO growth charts including weight, length/height, weight for height and BMI, head circumference, arm circumference, subscapular skinfold for age, TSF for age and weight, length and head circumference velocity (https://www.who.int/tools/child-growth-standards/standards)

- Olsen growth charts for preterm infants (https://www.peditools.org/olsen2010)


# Nutrition-Focused Physical Examination 

The nutrition-focused physical examination (NFPE) is an important part of the overall nutrition assessment of the child. It is the subjective assessment by the nutrition provider of the presence of malnutrition in children. The techniques of inspection and palpation are used to identify both macronutrient and micronutrient deficiency.

The clinical signs of malnutrition due to potential nutrient deficiency and the clinical data that support these physical findings can be assessed through a thorough hands-on examination of the child. Table 1-12 provides details on NFPE clinical signs of potential nutrient deficiency, physical signs of those deficiencies, and potential clinical support data. ${ }^{23,40,41}$

Using a checklist format (as shown in Table 1-13) when performing a NFPE allows the practitioner to select signs and symptoms present during the examination, for further consideration following the exam. ${ }^{42,43}$ These indicators of malnutrition can then be recorded in the medical record to support the diagnosis.

# Assessments of Muscle Wasting and Strength 

Malnourished children can have muscle wasting, fatigue, and decreased muscle strength. ${ }^{44-46}$ This change in functional status can be measured by handgrip strength which is a good indicator of overall muscle strength. ${ }^{47}$ However, the handgrip strength test can be more difficult to perform and interpret in children than in adults, in whom it is more studied. Because considerable cooperation is required, young children and those with neurodevelopmental challenges may have trouble with performance and cooperation. Figure 1-5 demonstrates the technique for using a handgrip dynamometer. ${ }^{41}$

A 6-minute walk test measures how far an individual can walk in 6 minutes. It has broad applications in assessing pulmonary function in children with chronic cardiorespiratory illness (eg, cystic fibrosis, congenital heart lesions, or pulmonary hypert enson) and in endurance in children with neuromuscular conditions like CP, spinal muscular atrophy, and muscular dystrophies. It is thought to reflect capabilities in the activities of daily living. However, reference levels for interpretation of the 6 -minute walk test vary widely, and its use as a nutrition indicator is not validated, which makes interpretation challenging. ${ }^{48}$

If children are undergoing regular 6 -minute walk tests for other reasons, the results could be used in conjunction with other nutrition data to assess changes in muscle function and strength, which can be an important indicator of nutrition status. (See "Subjective Global Nutrition Assessment" section in this chapter.) It may be difficult to tease out whether cardiopulmonary function, primary muscle dysfunction, or nutrition status was the cause of a change in distance walked in a 6minute walk test.

# Assessments of Fluid Status 

Fluid status and hydration in children should be assessed as part of the overall nutrition assessment. In general, fluid intake and fluid output should be in balance. Decreased intake or increased losses can lead to dehydration, just as increased intake and/or decreased output can lead to fluid retention and overhydration. Table 1-14 provides information that can be used to assess hydration status in children. ${ }^{49}$

# Subjective Global Nutrition Assessment 

The Subjective Global Nutrition Assessment (SGNA) is an assessment tool that has been validated for the assessment and diagnosis of malnutrition in the pediatric population including children with developmental differences and growth rates. ${ }^{50-52}$ This tool can be used to assess for the presence of malnutrition and is often used as the reference standard against which other tools are validated. Table 1-15 shows all the assessment components of the SGNA to identify normal nutrition status or moderate or severe variation in the expected nutrition status for age.

--- page 58 ---

# Laboratory Evaluation 

Laboratory evaluation of nutrition-related factors depends on the child's cooccurring medical conditions, their nutrition status, and the route of intake. There is no single indicator that can be used to determine nutrition status. Prealbumin and albumin were traditionally used as such markers; however, they are not useful nutrition indicators but instead are more important markers of inflammation. ${ }^{53}$ The NFPE or the SGNA may help point the way to laboratory evaluation based on the targeted history and clinical signs that it encompasses. Although there is some debate about whether children on stable enteral nutrition require regular laboratory evaluation, Romano et al suggest that for children with NI, assessment of their blood counts, iron status, zinc, and bone health status (vitamin D, calcium, and phosphate) is warranted. ${ }^{54}$ (See chapter 13, "Neurological Impairment and Developmental Disabilities.") They also note that in children with NI, micronutrient status may need to be monitored because of restrictions in dietary intake.

The same applies for all children with limited dietary repertoires. Deficiencies in iron (especially if vitamin C intake is limited), zinc, copper, calcium, phosphorus, carnitine, folic acid, vitamin $B_{12}$ (when using anticonvulsant medications), and vitamin D (if there is limited sunlight exposure) all need to be considered. ${ }^{52}$

## Summary of Nutrition Assessment

All children should be screened for nutrition risk in all settings, including inpatient (acute care), outpatient (ambulatory care), and community care settings. Simple pediatric nutrition risk screening tools are available that can be used in all settings. These can be administered by trained staff or by caregivers under the instruction of trained staff. A thorough nutrition assessment that is a follow-up to a positive score on a nutrition risk screen has been shown to lead to improved delivery of care for pediatric patients.

The assessment of nutrition status that includes all the information from the dietary and medical history, serial anthropometric measurements, NFPE, and laboratory data should be used to diagnose the nutrition problem(s) present. These data should be compared with accepted reference standards or established goals for

--- page 60 ---

the child. This information should be documented and communicated to the medical team to ensure that appropriate treatment, coding, and billing are provided for the care of the child. Once a nutrition plan is developed, the process continues with monitoring, reassessment, and adjusting of the plan as needed to ensure appropriate growth and wellbeing for the child.

## Malnutrition in Children

In the assessment for malnutrition in children, it is beneficial to use established standards to identify and diagnose the presence of the condition and to document its severity. In the United States, the most commonly used set of criteria for malnutrition are the Pediatric Academy of Nutrition and Dietetic and ASPEN consensus-derived "Indicators of Malnutrition" (pAAIM). ${ }^{1}$ Table 2-1 provides the pAAIM and the billing codes associated with the various indicators and gradations of malnutrition. ${ }^{1,2}$ When assessing a child for malnutrition using the pAAIM, it is recommended to include all the indicators in the assessment for which information or data for the child is available. A thorough nutrition assessment helps ensure accurate identification of the cause and acuity of malnutrition. Table 2-2 identifies the age-based criteria for children. ${ }^{1}$

Weight gain velocity assessment for malnutrition is based on an average daily or monthly weight gain required children to remain stable on the growth curve. These rates are determined by the trajectory of the growth curve, and they vary by age. The reference standard for ages 1 month to 24 months are the World Health Organization (WHO) velocity standards for weight. They are presented as a 1-month increment

table from birth to 12 months, and as 2- to 6-month increment tables from birth to 24 months. The calculation of weight gain velocity percentage of normal is based on the WHO weight gain velocity 1- to 2-month interval charts. Charts for weight gain velocity percentage of the norm in $\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{d}$ for mild, moderate, and severe malnutrition are provided for girls and boys in Tables $2-3$ and $2-4 .{ }^{3}$ There are other criteria for diagnosing malnutrition, including the WHO recommended criteria for diagnosis of severe acute malnutrition (undernutrition):

- Weight-for-height/length $z$ score (WHZ) of less than -3 of the WHO 2006 standard
- Mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) of less than 115 mm
- Edema related to nutrition status

Children identified with severe acute malnutrition by a low MUAC $(<115 \mathrm{~mm})$ and those identified by a low WHZ ( $z$ score $<-3$ ) have a similar mortality hazard, which is about 4 times higher than those without an anthropometric deficit. Having a low MUAC and a low WHZ was associated with an 8 times higher hazard of dying compared with children within the normal range. ${ }^{4,5}$

# Coding and Billing for Malnutrition

--- page 69 ---

The use of terms such as "failure to thrive" (FTT) to diagnose growth failure are less beneficial in documenting and communicating information regarding the child's nutrition state. FTT is a nonspecific, poorly defined term used to describe poor growth or the inability to maintain growth, usually in early childhood. It lacks the descriptive information required to diagnose malnutrition. ${ }^{1}$
"Malnutrition Matters: A Call to Action for Providers Caring for Pediatric Patients" provides information on documentation, coding, and reimbursement for malnutrition. ${ }^{6}$ It states that early recognition and intervention can reduce length of hospital stay and readmission, and that accurate coding improves reimbursement for the costs of care. ${ }^{7-10}$

Inflammation related to malnutrition leads to adverse outcomes through poor appetite and decreased food intake. It causes increased energy expenditure and increased muscle catabolism. It can lead to derangements of micronutrient function of vitamin D, iron, and zinc. Inflammation interferes with a child's response to nutrition interventions and may render medical therapies less effective. ${ }^{11}$ For children, inflammation also affects growth. It suppresses hepatic production of insulin-like growth factor and causes growth factor resistance at the growth plate. ${ }^{12}$ Being aware of the presence of inflammation in the assessment, identification, and treatment of malnutrition in children is a critical part of the nutrition plan of care. Biochemical markers of inflammation in pediatric patients are described in Table 2-5. ${ }^{1,10,13}$

# Malnutrition in Preterm Infants and Neonates 

Malnutrition in the preterm infant and neonate can have a lifelong negative impact. The data used to assess the presence of malnutrition of the preterm infant or neonate are like those used for the pediatric population. Evaluations of nutrient intake, anthropometric measurements, and growth velocity are used to determine if an infant is malnourished. The 2013 Fenton preterm growth chart ${ }^{14}$ or the 2010 Olsen intrauterine growth curves ${ }^{15}$ are the reference standards and should be used for infants born earlier than 37 weeks' gestation (both are available at https://www.peditools.org). The WHO child growth standards should be used for infants born at $370 / 7$ weeks' gestation and older. ${ }^{16}$

Growth assessment begins at birth by identifying whether an infant is small for gestational age (SGA), appropriate for gestational age (AGA), or large for gestational age, or has experienced intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). SGA is defined as a $z$ score below -1.25 (less than the 10th percentile) for gestational age, AGA is a $z$ score between -1.25 and 1.25 (10th to 90th percentile). IUGR is defined as a pathological process that causes weight to be less than the genetically predicted weight. IUGR is diagnosed by intrauterine growth failure with normal head circumference. ${ }^{17,18}$

Criteria for the diagnosis of preterm and neonatal infant malnutrition were suggested in an article published in $2018^{16}$ and are used for this population in the neonatal intensive care unit setting. Two sets of malnutrition indicators are available:

1. Those that require only a single indicator for diagnoses:

--- page 72 ---

a. "Adequacy of nutrient intake": preferred indicator for diagnosing malnutrition in the first 2 weeks of life
b. Decline in weight-for-age $z$ score and weight gain velocity lower than expected
2. Those that require 2 indicators for diagnosis of malnutrition in preterm infants and neonates:
a. Number of days to regain birth weight
b. Length gain velocity
c. Decline in length-for-age $z$ score.

In general, these indicators are used in combination with inadequate nutrient (energy and/or protein) intake as outlined in Table 2-6. ${ }^{16}$

--- page 73 ---

${ }^{a}$ Expected weight growth velocity and $z$ scores can be determined using the online calculator PediTools (https://www.peditools.org).

${ }^{\text {b }}$ Use with a second indicator and an accurate length measurement.

# Regain of Birth Weight 

Most infants, both term and preterm, demonstrate an initial postnatal weight loss. This usually results in a loss of $7 \%-10 \%$ of birth weight during the first few days of life. It is generally expected that infants will regain birth weight by $7-14$ days of age. ${ }^{19}$ When used in conjunction with adequacy of nutrient intake, the length of time required for the infant to regain birth weight, when longer than usual, suggests malnutrition, as delineated in the preterm/neonatal criteria.

## Weight Gain Velocity

The growth goal for the infant to maintain a weight gain velocity that will allow them to improve or maintain stability of their weight-for-age $z$ score ranges from $15-30 \mathrm{~g}$ per day. ${ }^{20}$ As with older children, weight gain velocity that is less than the weight gain needed to maintain stable growth is an indicator of malnutrition. ${ }^{21}$ The rate of weight gain velocity needed to maintain a stable weight-for-age $z$ score varies with weight, age, and sex; therefore, weight gain velocity goals are adjusted frequently. Weight gain goals can be established using preterm growth charts or a preterm growth calculator program or application such as PediTools (https://www.peditools.org).

## Change in Weight-for-Age z Score

Faltering growth as indicated by a decline in weight-for-age $z$ score is one of the recommended indicators for the identification of malnutrition in the preterm/neonatal population. The indicator for decline in weight-for-age $z$ score is based on a large, international, longitudinal, observational study that reported infants with uncomplicated postnatal adaptation transitioned to a weight gain trajectory 0.8 SD below birth at day of life 21 . The cutoffs for mild, moderate, and severe malnutrition also reflect the expected rate of weight gain of preterm infants and

--- page 75 ---

neonates. ${ }^{22}$ Rates of weight gain vary depending on the infant and need to be calculated based on growth charts, weight gain velocity charts, or using a growth calculator such as PediTools.

# Length 

The indicators related to length include less-than-expected linear growth velocity and decline in length-for-age $z$ score. Linear growth is dependent on fat-free mass accretion and adequate protein and micronutrient intake. Therefore, it is recommended that the indicators related to linear growth be used in conjunction with nutrient intake in the identification of malnutrition. ${ }^{23}$

The publication "Applying the Recommended Indicators for the Diagnosis of Preterm and Neonatal Malnutrition: Answers to Frequently Asked Questions" offers some additional guidance for the use of the indicators. ${ }^{24}$ There are a few simple steps to follow to diagnose malnutrition in an infant: ${ }^{22}$

1. Determine which set of criteria to use to diagnose the infant.
a. Is the infant preterm-is the infant term and less than 30 days old?

- Use the preterm/neonatal indicators.
b. Is the infant a term baby and/or are they 1 month of age or older?
- Use the pediatric criteria.

2. Assess all criteria for which data are available.
a. Preterm-neonatal criteria
b. Pediatric criteria for $1-24$ months of age
3. Select the criteria with the highest acuity/severity on which to base the diagnosis.
a. Mild vs moderate vs severe malnutrition
4. Document the diagnosis and the assessment on which the diagnosis is based.
a. State the diagnosis, the criteria, and the severity
5. Communicate the diagnosis and treatment to the medical provider responsible for the care of the child.

## Developmental Feeding Stages

As part of the nutrition assessment, noting the child's achievement of their developmental milestones related to feeding skills is an essential part of the process. This information will help the provider in developing an appropriate treatment plan for the child. Table 3-1 outlines important features of feeding development and transitions to age-appropriate foods. ${ }^{1-4}$ Useful guidance on breastfeeding can be found in the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Policy statement, "Breastfeeding and the Use of Human Milk." ${ }^{5}$

# Feeding, Eating, and Drinking Difficulties, Including Swallowing Problems (Dysphagia)

--- page 82 ---

Feeding oneself or feeding someone else involves more than just swallowing. Food is imbued with a tangle of emotions and meaning for all of us. It is how we celebrate, relate, and communicate and how we learn about our cultures. For infants, the most important developmental task is learning how to eat because it lies at the heart of communication.

The same holds true for children with feeding, eating, and drinking difficulties. They and their families want the same shared sensory and social experiences, although these may be more difficult to achieve. Because of the broad range of challenges with food consumption, the help of a multidisciplinary team in the assessment of feeding, eating, and drinking difficulties is invaluable.

Dysphagia is difficulty swallowing. It has different connotations for different people; hence, we will refer to "feeding, eating, and drinking difficulties" because the phrase is more inclusive of some of the ancillary problems associated with eating. "Penetration" means that swallowed material enters the upper airway but does not pass below the vocal cords, whereas "aspiration" means that food or liquid has passed below the vocal cords when a child swallows. Aspiration can occur before, during, or after swallowing, as well as from gastroesophageal reflux (GER).

# Three Phases of Swallowing 

The process of swallowing is usually divided into three phases: oral, pharyngeal, and esophageal phases, all of which can be impacted by anatomic or physiologic variation, thereby impacting food intake. ${ }^{2}$ Although reflexively driven in early infancy, as the oral phase matures, it is voluntary. Once it is volitional, food is to be put closer to the front of the mouth for more manipulation of texture.

Once triggered, the pharyngeal phase is involuntary. It involves the following:

- Moving food or liquid through the pharynx
- Automatic closures of the
- Nasopharynx with the uvula and soft palate rising
- Larynx and the epiglottis retroflexing over the airway
- Brief cessation of breathing followed by an exhalation

--- page 83 ---

The esophageal phase is also involuntary. The upper esophageal sphincter opens, and food is propelled to the stomach by peristaltic action. The delicate, millisecond choreography among the neurological, gastrointestinal (GI), and respiratory systems is important in every swallow. That is why eating and drinking are difficult tasks and why swallowing safety can be so easily disrupted by developmental, physiologic, or anatomic variation.

Feeding, eating, and swallowing difficulties include ${ }^{6}$ food processing issues occurring in the preparatory and oral stages of swallowing, also known as oromotor problems, which are most common in children with neurological impairment (NI). Children with NI may be completely dependent on others and unable to signal hunger or thirst, thereby limiting their intake. Swallowing difficulty and aspiration are problems related to the pharyngeal and esophageal stages and are most often present in children with disabilities or anatomic variations in the aerodigestive tract.

Oral-sensory problems occur most often in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), although they can be present with any developmental disability, and are one of the reasons for food selectivity in children with ASD. The sensation, smell, texture, presentation, and viscosity of food can result in aversive behavior in some children and limit their food intake. Behavioral challenges that impact intake and increase stress in caregivers can occur in any child, whether they are typically developing or have NI. Self-feeding difficulties may be related to behavioral challenges, NI, or anatomic variation of their limbs.

# Conditions Causing Feeding, Eating, and Swallowing Difficulties 

Feeding, eating, and swallowing difficulties may occur in children with any of the following conditions.

## Craniofacial Anomalies

- Choanal atresia may cause difficulties because infants are obligate nasal breathers.
- A cleft lip may also cause difficulties, so consider using a nipple with a broad base or alternating different positions during breastfeeding so that the baby gets a good seal.

--- page 84 ---

- A cleft palate can impact food/liquid intake, processing, and swallowing, so special bottle systems with a one-way valve can help infants who cannot develop suction because of the open palate.
- Chiari malformations may impact swallowing function because of brain stem effects.


# Aerodigestive Tract Anomalies 

- Laryngomalacia: It is important to pay close attention to infants' respiratory effort expended for drinking by monitoring weight gain.
- Vocal cord dysfunction: Can occur congenitally or after cardiothoracic surgery and can impair airway protection, so consider the following:
- liquid modification,
- adjusting liquid flow, and
- alternative positions for breastfeeding may help.
- Tracheolaryngeal clefts: Success of feeding depends on the depth of the cleft. Some require surgical intervention. Swallowing can be affected long after the surgical repair.
- Tracheoesophageal fistula with or without esophageal atresia: Requires surgical intervention and there can be ongoing challenges with swallowing after repair.
- Vascular rings
- Tumors/growths


## Neurological Conditions, Developmental Variation, and Genetic Conditions

Any condition impacting the nerves or muscles can affect the complex choreography between swallowing and breathing that is required for successful eating and drinking, from accepting food to swallowing. Children benefit from a concerted look at all the factors that affect feeding, from co-occurring medical conditions, their oromotor and swallowing skills, their nutrition status, and the feeding environment to their families' values around feeding or eating.

## Chronic Lung Disease and Cardiovascular Disease

Chronic lung disease can impact the respiratory rate and effort during eating or feeding, which can impact swallowing safety. Changes in the respiratory rate and effort can impact swallowing safety. Cardiovascular disease can also impact feeding, eating, and swallowing. The energy required during the process of food consumption can be high in children

--- page 85 ---

with heart disease. This can result in the energy cost of drinking/eating exceeding their caloric intake.

# GI Tract Disturbance 

GER disease can impact swallowing function by affecting the esophageal phase of swallowing. It can also cause aspiration of refluxate. Allergic phenomena such as food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome, eosinophilic esophagitis, or IgE-mediated food allergies can all affect intake and change a child and family's approach to food. Limited dietary repertoires may have to be initiated. Constipation can also have significant negative impact on intake of food.

## Preterm Birth

Preterm birth can affect the feeding process because preterm infants often have chronic lung disease, which can be associated with feeding difficulties. They may have difficulties transitioning from enteral nutrition (EN) support to oral feeding, so consider the following:

- oromotor work,
- positioning, and
- flow control from the nipple.

A lot of patience with very cautious increases in intake can facilitate safe feeding.

## An Approach to Feeding, Eating, and Drinking Difficulties

The International Classification of Function, Disease and Disability ${ }^{7}$ can be used to map feeding difficulties regardless of the underlying problems. If one can identify a barrier to oral intake, then it is potentially amenable to intervention by one of the multidisciplinary team members, the family, or other players involved in the child's care and feeding.

The following are considerations for approaching feeding, eating, and drinking difficulties. All the factors are interdependent.

1. Fitness to eat
a. Cognition, awareness, and sensing hunger and thirst

--- page 86 ---

b. Strength, control, and endurance
c. Impact of illness and hospitalization on intake
2. Health
a. Nutrition and hydration
b. Secretion management
c. Aspiration
d. Respiratory illness

- Chronic lung disease
- Obstructive sleep apnea
e. Cardiovascular disease
f. GI disturbances
- Food protein-induced syndromes
- GER
- Constipation
g. Pubertal status affecting weight gain and growth rates ${ }^{8}$

3. Functional motor ability to consume food
a. Sensory factors affecting intake
b. Positioning challenges for children with skeletal deformities
c. Oromotor skills
d. Swallowing competence
4. Adaptation of the environment to foster participation in eating
a. Safety of eating across all environments
b. Training all caregivers
c. Participation in the "activity of eating," when possible, with family, at school, and in community settings
5. Environmental factors
a. Family values around food
b. Adequate time to eat
c. Appropriate utensils
d. Access to appropriate, affordable food
e. Food preparation for appropriate texture and viscosity
f. Air quality affecting lung health and thereby affecting oral intake and swallowing competence
6. Personal factors
a. Behavioral issues interfering with intake
b. Food preferences

# Medical Tests in the Assessment of Eating and Drinking Difficulties 

A good history, physical examination, and feeding observation lie at the heart of a complete feeding assessment. Instrumental swallowing assessments such as a videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS) or a

--- page 87 ---

fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) are extensions of the clinical information obtained in the feeding observation and are the only way to definitively diagnose swallowing dysfunction and aspiration.

Other common tests for children with eating and drinking difficulties include the following:

- Chest x-ray to assess chronic signs of aspiration.
- VFSS, also known as a "modified barium swallow," can be used to assess all phases of swallowing and assist in the decisions about making the oral feeding experience safer.
- Food and liquids of different skill level-appropriate consistencies, viscosities, and textures are mixed with contrast and offered to the child sitting in a chair that supports them well.
- The VFSS is not the same as an upper GI series, which is also sometimes called a "barium swallow." Whereas the VFSS focuses on the path of a food bolus from the mouth, through the pharynx and esophagus, an upper GI series looks more broadly at the upper GI anatomy.
- FEES, an evaluation in which a laryngoscope is placed above the larynx while feeding is observed. Although the FEES can determine aspiration by direct visualization, part of the swallowing process cannot be seen because the food/liquid bolus envelopes the scope.
- A salivagram is a nuclear medicine test showing the transit of saliva from the mouth to the stomach or, if not swallowed correctly, into the lungs. A small amount of tracer is placed on the child's tongue, and the progress of the tracer is followed to see if any saliva enters the lung.
- In an upper GI series, an x-ray contrast study is often done when reflux is suspected and one wants to clarify the anatomy to ensure that there are no factors predisposing the child to GER (ie, outflow obstruction of the stomach or malrotation of the intestine). Although the study does not quantitate GER, it does provide valuable information about the upper GI tract, through which the food boluses must travel.
- Endoscopy of the otorhinological system, respiratory system, and the GI tract may be required to fully diagnose complex conditions involving all 3 systems (anatomic and physiologic).


# Interventions for Swallowing Dysfunction 

Swallowing safety is impacted by a host of factors, which have been mentioned in previous sections. One of the mainstays of managing swallowing dysfunction is ensuring that the food texture and viscosity are appropriate for the child's skill level. In small infants for whom thickening may not be appropriate (see the following list), swallowing safety may be improved by positioning, pacing the feeding, and changing the flow from the nipple. In older children, texture changes may be

--- page 88 ---

required to ensure that the bolus is homogeneous because of poor oral processing skills or because a cohesive food bolus is required to prevent the bolus from dividing in the pharynx and causing aspiration.

Improving swallowing safety may involve thickening the liquids, which changes the swallowing mechanics and improves pacing as the bolus moves through the oropharynx. ${ }^{9}$

- The effect of thickening may lie in the inherent properties of a thickened liquid being more cohesive.
- Thickening may, however, result in more residual food in the pharynx that a child is unable to clear because of pharyngeal muscle weakness. This residual material causes a risk of aspiration.
- Thickening may also decrease liquid palatability and increase the risk of dehydration. ${ }^{10}$ AVFSS or FEES can help determine the most appropriate food consistency, texture, and viscosity for a child and help improve swallowing safety.


# The International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative 

The International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative (IDDSI) ${ }^{11}$ was founded with the goal of developing new international standardized terminology and definitions to describe texture- and viscosity-modified foods and thickened liquids. Aligning our vocabulary with the IDDSI terms in our clinical assessments and in commercial and home kitchens where food modification is required will result in a common language that improves our understanding and communication of a child's needs with colleagues and members of assessment teams. Figure 3-1 illustrates the IDDSI categorization of food and liquid viscosities and consistencies.

The IDDSI group also developed the "syringe flow test" to measure the consistency, thickness, and flow properties of foods by using utensils that can easily be sourced for home. The tool allows families to try different thickeners to improve palatability and thereby increases adherence to the use of thickened liquids, which may mitigate the aspiration risk.

However, the IDDSI syringe flow test does not always match the viscosities as measured by a viscometer. ${ }^{12}$ The testing is impacted by the degree of blending and, among other factors, the residual fiber size after the blending process has been completed and whether a kitchen strainer has been used to remove them. These fiber particulates can clog the test syringe and thus overestimate the thickness or viscosity of the preparation tested. ${ }^{13}$ The IDDSI syringe test is illustrated in Figure 3-2.

--- page 91 ---

# THE IDDSI Flow Test is used to classify liquid thickness 

IDDSI uses an objective measurement tool for liquid thickness, 10 mL syringe. In the near future funnels that have been specifically designed for IDDSI testing may be available.

Sometimes, viscosity, consistency, or texture changes achieved by using blenderized tube feeding is recommended for the treatment of retching, GER, or GER-related aspiration events. In that case, the IDDSI syringe flow test may need to be carried out after using a kitchen strainer to minimize the impact of the particulates on the flow measurement.

## Thickening Agents

--- page 92 ---

Commercial thickeners need to be used with caution in preterm infants, especially before they reach 44 weeks' corrected gestational age. In these small infants, there is a risk of late-onset necrotizing enterocolitis. ${ }^{14}$ Most commercial thickeners carry a warning not to use them before certain ages. Thickeners can negatively impact gastric emptying and the palatability and digestibility of the infant formula or breast milk. When considering thickener use, close teamwork among dietitians, swallowing specialists (speech language pathologists, occupational therapists, or feeding team pediatricians), and the medical team is invaluable in achieving a nutritious diet that is safer for infants and children to swallow. Table 3-2 outlines the use of thickening agents for children with dysphagia. ${ }^{14,15}$

--- page 93 ---

TABLE 3-2. Potential Thickening Agents and Considerations

| Thickener | Approved Age of Use | Special Considerations |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Infant cereal | - Preterm infants must be $>44$ wk of corrected age. <br> - Term infants should be $>37$ wk. <br> - If infants are $<48 \mathrm{wk}$ (preterm and term), cereal use as a thickener should be approved by attending physician to ensure that the medical benefits outweigh potential risk (such as necrotizing enterocolitis). ${ }^{a}$ | - Ensure that the upper tolerable limit of iron is not exceeded because of the high iron content of infant cereal. <br> - Calorie concentration of the formula is increased by $5 \mathrm{kcal} /$ teaspoon of cereal. <br> - 10 mL of cereal per 30 mL of formula may make a viscosity similar to "mildly thick"; however, all thickened formula must be checked at various temperatures/times to see how much postmixing thickening occurs. <br> - Infant cereal will not thicken breast milk. ${ }^{\text {b }}$ <br> - If using rice cereal, the arsenic content may need to be considered. |
| Commercial thickened infant formula (rice starchadded infant formula) | - Preterm infants must be $>44$ wk of corrected age. <br> - Term infants $>37 \mathrm{wk}$ (term infants). <br> - If $<48 \mathrm{wk}$ (preterm and term), thickener use should be approved by attending physician to ensure that the medical benefits outweigh potential risk such as necrotizing enterocolitis. ${ }^{a}$ | - Slightly thick viscosity is similar to rice starch-added formula made at $0.68 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mL}$. <br> - Concentrating the added starch formula will increase viscosity, but is variable because commercially thickened formulas are meant to be thickened when exposed to acid. |
| Gum-based thickeners | - Carob bean gum thickener is used in preterm infants $>42 \mathrm{wk}$ of corrected age. | Will thicken breast milk. ${ }^{\text {b }}$ |
|  | - Xanthan gum thickeners <br> - Gels and powders are not recommended for infants $<1 \mathrm{y}$ of age. ${ }^{\text {C }}$ | - Will thicken breast milk. <br> - Some products contain milk. |
|  | - Tara gum thickener for children $>1 \mathrm{y}$ |  |

# Options for Route of Intake 

When oral feeding is unsafe or insufficient to meet the nutrition requirements, enteral feeding may be required. Family considerations are very important when discussing the move from oral to enteral feeding. In general, families value oral feeding and eating because they are so important to all cultures and heritages. It is around the table that we learn

--- page 95 ---

communication skills, where we learn about celebrations and family traditions.

When introducing the concept of enteral feeding, it is important for team members to explore the family values around eating and drinking. Family goals about oral feeding should be discussed, and when there are foods with textures or viscosities that are safe for the children to continue eating, these should be incorporated into an overall nutrition care plan.

It is important for team members evaluating oral feeding to appreciate that skills do change over time for many children, and therefore, enteral feeding may only be required temporarily. Thus, developing an "exit strategy" from EN support may be appropriate early during enteral feeding, whether by nasogastric tube, gastrostomy tube, or postpyloric tube. Table 3-3 describes the various types of enteral access devices (EADs) for nutrition support and the advantages and disadvantages for use. ${ }^{16-21}$ (See also chapter 5, "Enteral Nutrition," for more information on various types of EADs.)

TABLE 3-3. Description of Enteral Access Devices and Their Advantages and Disadvantages

| Enteral <br> Access <br> Devices | Usage | Advantages | Disadvantages |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| OG tube | When NG tube is difficult to place (choanal atresia) or infant is unable to breathe easily with NG tube | Easily placed by skilled staff | Unstable for home use |
| NG tube | - Generally thought of as "short-term usage" (<12 wk) but can be used for longer periods <br> - Can be used in the home setting with appropriate safety teaching and support ${ }^{a}$ <br> - Parents need to demonstrate the ability to measure and mark the tube position, insert the tube, verify position of the tube, and secure it ${ }^{a}$ | - Can be used for months <br> - Relatively inexpensive <br> - Can facilitate hospital discharge <br> - Parents can be taught safe tube usage and replacement | - With long-term usage ( $>6 \mathrm{mo}$ ), the passage of tubes may become more difficult <br> - Nose bleeds, sinusitis, and septal erosion can occur with prolonged usage |
| NJ tube | Short-term usage for children with intractable emesis (eg, those undergoing chemotherapy) |  | Needs skilled bedside or fluoroscopic placement |
| GT | - Tubes are placed directly into the stomach by endoscopic, laparoscopic, or open procedure <br> - Usually placed when children are not making any progress toward oral feeding after several months of NG feeding | - Tubes are relatively stable <br> - Parent satisfaction generally high <br> - Education for families needed to ensure that they are well supported | Placement of GT increases cost, emergency room visits, and hospitalization ${ }^{b}$ |

# PART II 

## Nutrition Care Plan

--- page 102 ---

# Infant to Adolescent 

Mary Pat Turon-Findley, Med, RD, CMHIMP, LD

## Introduction

Health status and a fundamental nutrition base start at the level of conception, with the support of a healthy and nourished fetus throughout gestation and continue throughout the lifespan. Nutrition support practice should include use of evidence-based practices, acknowledged growth/nutrient guidelines, monitoring for malnutrition, and the use of outcomes from timely research and references. Synthesis of this information should guide any required treatment and nutrition interventions for clinical professionals. Key communication within the interdisciplinary team and family will create continuity of care following the nutrition support journey from infancy to adolescence. ${ }^{1}$

## Determining Nutrient Needs

Determining nutrient and fluid needs is a critical step in developing an enteral nutrition (EN) plan, as energy and protein needs change with age and vary by sex (see Tables 4-1 and 4-2).

| $<6$ mo | $85-105$ |
| 6-12 mo | $80-100$ |

# Energy Needs 

Indirect calorimetry (IC) is the gold standard for estimating resting energy expenditure (REE). ${ }^{2}$ It measures oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production to determine REE. Given equipment needs and patient requirements, IC is not always clinically feasible. IC devices may include devices that can be used with patients who are mechanically ventilated or smaller devices that are use a hood canopy, mouthpiece, or

--- page 104 ---

handheld unit. ${ }^{2}$ See chapter 11, "Critical Care," for further discussion of IC.

To estimate energy needs for children without IC available, calculate basal metabolic rate (BMR), assess growth goals, and consider increased needs related to illness. Predictive equations can be helpful in determining BMR using the Schofield equation (Table 4-3) and REE using the World Health Organization (WHO) equation (Table 4-4). ${ }^{1}$ Infants and children who are below their expected growth patterns may require higher energy provision to allow for catch-up growth. Not attaining catch-up growth may lead to additional medical issues, permanent stunting, and cognitive delays. ${ }^{1,2}$ For hospitalized children whose energy needs may be altered with metabolic stress, the following stress factors may be used to better estimate energy needs:

- Starvation: $0.7-0.85$
- Surgery: $1.05-1.5$
- Sepsis: $1.2-1.6$
- Closed head injury: 1.3
- Trauma: $1.1-1.8$
- Growth Failure: $1.5-2$
- Burn: $1.5-2.5^{3}$

# Fluids 

Adequate hydration is essential for maintenance of health. The HolidaySegar method allows for calculation of baseline fluid needs (Table 4-5). Baseline hydration status and the presence of dehydration or fluid overload should be assessed and used to guide the nutrition care plan (see chapter 1, "Nutrition Screening and History," Table 1-14). Children with acute and chronic illness may have special nutrition and fluid considerations. See disease-specific chapters for more information.

${ }^{a}$ This may underestimate fluid requirements by about $5 \%$ in young children; 5 $\mathrm{mL} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{h}$ is often used to avoid this.

## Acid-Base Status

Acid-base balance is maintained by the lungs, kidneys, and endogenous buffers. Acid-base disorders include acidosis and alkalosis of either

--- page 107 ---

metabolic or respiratory origin. Many of these imbalances may be attributed to chronic health issues, organ issues, medications, parenteral nutrition (PN), diarrhea, and other electrolyte/metabolic changes. Careful attention to fluid losses is important when developing a nutrition care plan. See chapter 6, "Parenteral Nutrition," Table 6-8 for the electrolyte composition of different body fluids. ${ }^{2,5}$

# Vitamins and Minerals 

Vitamins and minerals are essential for growth and development in infants and children. Ensuring adequacy is a key component of the nutrition care plan. Key terms to know when assessing the vitamin and nutrient needs of a patient include the following:

- Estimated average requirements (EAR): The intake value that is estimated to meet the requirement defined by a specified indicator of adequacy in $50 \%$ of an age- and sexspecific group. ${ }^{2}$
- Recommended dietary allowance (RDA): The intake level that is sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all healthy persons and includes a wide safety margin to prevent deficiency. ${ }^{2}$
- Adequate intake (AI): The recommended daily average intake from observed estimates that is assumed to be adequate for the population. AI should be used as a goal for intake when no RDAs exist. ${ }^{2}$
- Upper intake limit (UL): The maximum level of daily nutrient intake that is unlikely to pose risk of adverse health effects. ${ }^{2}$
- Daily dietary reference intake (DRI): Intake amounts based on contemporary studies that not only address preventing nutrition deficiencies but also reducing the risk of chronic disease, promoting optimal health, and preventing toxicities. ${ }^{2}$

See Tables 4-6 through 4-10 for vitamin and mineral references.

# Nutrition Diagnosis 

Ascertainment of information is critical to support an accurate and descriptive nutrition diagnosis. The interview/screen or gathering of information should include growth and anthropometric history, intake history, supplements, cultural needs, food barriers/challenges, economic concerns, family systems, food insecurity issues, home environment, avoidances/food beliefs, medical issues, medications, laboratory values,

--- page 113 ---

gastrointestinal (GI) issues/concerns, physical activity/interests, sleep patterns, signs and symptoms of malnutrition, and the nutrition-focused physical examination. ${ }^{1,2,6,7}$

# Terminology 

In the nutrition care plan, it is important to document the presence of malnutrition, chronicity, and etiology. ${ }^{8}$

- Acute malnutrition: Present $<3$ months
- Chronic malnutrition: Present $>3$ months
- Illness-related malnutrition: Occurs as the result of a disease process leading to increased nutrient losses such as with diarrhea or vomiting, altered nutrient use, and/or increased energy needs
- Non-illness-related malnutrition: Occurs as the result of environmental or behavioral factors that lead to decreased nutrient intake. Underlying causes of non-illness-related malnutrition include economic issues such as food insecurity, decreased nutrient provision or intake, and behavioral issues.

Chapter 1, "Nutrition Screening and History," and chapter 2, "Malnutrition," further discuss malnutrition diagnostic criteria.

## Billing and Coding

The nutrition diagnosis should reflect specific criteria to align with the billable diagnosis. ${ }^{1,2,8,9}$ International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes were developed by WHO and were adapted by the US health care system for billing purposes. Codes vary greatly and the clinical nutrition professional should consult the hospital billing codes that reflect the criteria of the nutrition diagnosis. The following are examples ofICD, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification, codes:

- E44.1: Mild protein-calorie malnutrition
- E44.0: Moderate protein-calorie malnutrition
- E43: Severe protein-calorie malnutrition


## Nutrition Interventions

Nutrition interventions should be patient- and disease-specific with a nutrition care plan that addresses the specific issues identified by the

--- page 114 ---

clinical nutrition professional and team. ${ }^{1,2,6,9}$

# Nutrition Care Plan 

The basic nutrition care plan for nutrition support should include the following:

- Route of administration
- Type of diet or formula
- Schedule of administration
- Starting rate, advancement plan, and target rate
- Monitoring frequency
- Details of nutrient goals (energy, protein, carbohydrates, fat, fluid, vitamin, and minerals as applicable)
- Weight gain and growth targets

The ASPEN Pediatric Nutrition Care Pathway guides the nutrition care professional through all steps of the nutrition care pathway, including screening, assessment, classification, documentation, intervention, monitoring, and discharge planning (see Figure 4-1; fullsize color version available on the ASPEN website: https://www.nutritioncare.org/uploadedFiles/Documents/Malnutrition/Pe diatric-Nutrition-Pathway_9.14.22.pdf).

--- page 119 ---

Frequency of monitoring the nutrition care plan depends on the age and severity of malnutrition present and is outlined in Table 4-11. Infants have higher expected growth and weight gain velocity than older children and therefore require more frequent assessment of their growth. See chapter 1, "Nutrition Screening and History," for expected rates of weight gain and linear growth.

ASPEN Pediatric Nutrition Support Core Curriculum. 3rd ed. American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition. Forthcoming 2024.

# Route of Administration 

Whenever possible, the GI tract should be used. If a patient is able to take any or all oral feeds safely, this should be promoted. ${ }^{1,2,9}$ If the oral route cannot be used, enteral feeding via tube may be used. An initial tube feeding plan should include starting and goal volumes, rate of administration, and feeding schedule. Patients should be monitored for

--- page 122 ---

tolerance, refeeding syndrome if applicable, changes in malnutrition status, and medical stability.

For cases in which oral and enteral tube feeding are not available or tolerated, parenteral feeding can be used. With any form of nutrition support, long-term goals may include returning to oral intakes as medically appropriate, even if only to promote quality of life. ${ }^{1,2,9}$

# Feeding Advancement 

Initiate feeds and advance to the anticipated goal taking into consideration medical status, tolerance, growth needs, physical activity, developmental status, and malnutrition status. Enteral feeding rate, concentration of formula, and schedule of feeds may be adjusted as feedings increase. When advancing oral feeds, it is important to consider the rapid development in feeding skills of infants and children as outlined in chapter 3, "Clinical Considerations," Table 3-1.

## Transitions

Managing transitional feedings is the process of transitioning nutrition support from one modality to another or weaning a patient off nutrition support to oral eating and should be individualized with goals and timing reflective of patient's clinical status. ${ }^{5}$

Parenteral Nutrition to Tube Feedings. When transitioning from PN to tube feeding, begin tapering PN when tube feedings are providing $33 \%-50 \%$ of patient's nutrient requirements. Progress with decreasing PN and increasing EN until tube feedings are tolerated and provide $60 \%-75 \%$ of nutrient requirements; PN can then be discontinued. ${ }^{5}$ It is important to continuously meet assessed nutrition needs for children who may be weaning slowly off PN to EN or may continue to require small amounts of supplemental PN long-term.

--- page 123 ---

Tube Feeding to Oral Intake. As oral intake increases, supplement EN to meet needs at a reduced rate. Maintain placement of temporary access device until meeting nutrient requirements and showing consistent growth. ${ }^{5}$ Long-term enteral access devices may remain in place for several months to ensure the patient continues to meet weight gain and growth goals.

Ways to help increase oral intake include the following:

- Offer meals in an age-appropriate seat.
- Schedule meals and snacks to prevent grazing.
- Ensure that there are no distractions during mealtime., 1,2,6,7
- Offer oral foods before tube feeds.
- Give tube feeds while offering oral foods.


# Communication With the Patient and Family 

Communication is key to improved assessment, treatment, intervention, outcomes, and continuity of care. The clinical nutrition professional needs to communicate with both the patient and family as well as the patient care teams in medical and ancillary areas such as the kitchen, formula room, home care, or food service providers.

It is important to address barriers to communication, including the following:

- Cultural differences and beliefs
- Language
- Educational levels, including understanding of health and medical terms
- Cognitive issues, including past trauma, substance use, and neurological losses
- Religious beliefs
- Economic or family stressors
- Geography and location
- Grief
- Surrogate decision makers
- Shortages in staffing and/or supplies
- Insurance
- Any additional barriers to care. ${ }^{1,2,9}$

Taking time to address the individualized communication needs of patients and their families will aid in the monitoring process and the ability to offer targeted nutrition education and support when needed, improving outcomes and the continuum of care.

## Enteral Nutrition

Laura Gearman, MS, RD, LD, CNSC

## Enteral Nutrition Access

Enteral nutrition (EN) support is a nutrition intervention that can provide full or partial nutrition support to patients with a functional gastrointestinal (GI) tract. To supply nutrition, an enteral access device (EAD) is required. Temporary EADs are intended to be used for 12 weeks or fewer. ${ }^{1}$ The feeding tube type should be selected for each individual patient considering the intended use of the tube, the diameter or French size, and the insertion length. Long-term EADs are placed when it is determined that nutrition support will be needed for more than 3 months. ${ }^{2}$ Patients should meet one of the following criteria to proceed with the placement of a long-term EAD:

- Not safe or unable to feed by mouth
- Not able to eat enough by mouth
- Unable to consume special medical diet by mouth
- Adequate support for management of a short-term device not available
- Require gastric decompression ${ }^{2}$

Tables 5-1 through 5-5 further discuss EADs.

# Enteral Nutrition Complications 

## Clogged Tubes

Any feeding tube may become clogged; however, smaller-bore and longer EADs are most implicated. Feeding tubes may become clogged from inadequate tube flushing with medication administration or feedings. To prevent clogged tubes, use the following guidelines:

- Provide adequate flushing with sterile water before and after administering medications.
- Avoid providing crushed medications.
- Provide scheduled flushing of jejunal tubes. ${ }^{2}$

If a tube does become clogged, a pancreatic enzyme activated with a $650-\mathrm{mg}$ tablet of sodium bicarbonate may be used to attempt to unclog the tube. Avoid cola soda and juice as they may lead to further worsening of the clog because of pH changes in the mixture. ${ }^{3}$

--- page 131 ---

# Skin Complications 

Caring for the skin around an EAD is essential to maintaining skin integrity. Skin breakdown around a tube site may cause drainage and leaking from the tube site, which can further damage the skin and interrupt feedings. Proper hygiene and protecting the skin from moisture, friction, and trauma are the most important steps to prevent skin breakdown. ${ }^{2}$ Patients requiring EN should have an interdisciplinary team to provide comprehensive care and treat complications. ${ }^{2}$ Clinicians and families can find more resources on feeding tubes on the Feeding Tube Awareness Foundation website (https://www.feedingtubeawareness.org/). ${ }^{4}$

## Formula Selection

## Human Milk

Human milk is the optimal feeding choice for most infants. Mother's milk or donor human milk may be used in feeding infants.

## Human Milk Fortification

Human milk can be fortified for both preterm and term infants. Liquid human milk fortifiers, powdered infant formulas, concentrated infant formulas or modulars may be used. See chapter 7, "Neonatal Nutrition," for more details.

## Infant Formulas

Infant formulas are regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with specifications regarding labeling, quality control, formula recalls, new product notifications, exempt products, and nutrient levels. Infant formulas are intended to meet the nutrition needs of healthy infants from birth to 1 year of age. Manufacturers are required to declare the levels of each nutrient and analyze each batch of formula to ensure those

--- page 132 ---

levels are present in the product. There are established minimal levels for 29 nutrients and maximum levels for 9 nutrients. ${ }^{5}$

# Standard Infant Formulas 

Standard infant formulas have the following characteristics (see Appendix 5-2):

- They are made from cow's milk and suitable for most term infants.
- Composition of macronutrients and micronutrients varies among manufacturers.
- Higher in protein and some essential nutrients than breast milk, in which these nutrients are more bioavailable.
- Varieties include organic formulas, formulas targeted for breast milk supplementation, and formulas with additional prebiotics or probiotics.


## Reduced-Lactose/Lactose-Free Formulas

Reduced-lactose and lactose-free formulas are similar to standard milkbased formulas in both macronutrient and micronutrient content, but polysaccharides are used instead of lactose for the carbohydrate source. This may be done in formulas with hydrolyzed protein to reduce the osmolality. Formulas with reduced-lactose and/or partially hydrolyzed protein are not appropriate for infants with cow's milk protein intolerance. Congenital lactase deficiency is extremely rare because most babies make adequate amounts of lactase. See Appendix 5-3.

## Soy-Based Formulas

Soy-based formulas are fortified with iron and are lactose free. They contain higher calcium and phosphorous content than standard infant formulas because of decreased bioavailability. They may be used with galactosemia, hereditary lactase deficiency, or if a vegan human milk substitute is desired. See Appendix 5-4.

## Extensively Hydrolyzed Protein Formulas

Extensively hydrolyzed protein formulas are considered hypoallergenic and can be used for infants with cow's milk or soy protein intolerance

--- page 133 ---

because of the protein content of free amino acids and small peptides. These formulas have similar macronutrient distribution among them but differ in sources of carbohydrates and fats. They may also be used for infants with malabsorption. See Appendix 5-5.

# Amino Acid-Based Formulas 

Amino acid-based formulas contain free amino acids as the protein source with varying carbohydrate and fat sources. They may be indicated in allergic infants and infants who do not respond to extensively hydrolyzed protein formulas, eosinophilic GI disorders, or short bowel syndrome. See Appendix 5-6.

## Added Rice Starch Formulas

Formulas with added rice starch are designed to thicken in the acidic environment of the stomach to reduce episodes of spit up. The macronutrient distribution is similar to standard milk-based formulas. If rice or oat cereal is added to a standard formula in attempt to reduce spit up, the macronutrient distribution is disturbed, resulting in increased carbohydrate intake. See Appendix 5-7.

## Preterm Formulas

Preterm or low birth weight formulas as well as preterm discharge formulas are discussed in chapter 4, "Infant to Adolescent."

## Other Infant Formulas

Other types of infant formulas include the following (see Appendix 5-8):

- Carbohydrate free: Designed for infants with carbohydrate metabolism disorders or carbohydrate malabsorption and require the addition of a carbohydrate source for use.
- Modified fat: Used in conditions of fat malabsorption, lymphatic disorders, chylothorax, or long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency and require monitoring for essential fatty acid (EFA) deficiencies.
- Reduced mineral: Designed to mimic mineral content of human milk to support infants with calcium disorders or impaired renal function and require additional supplementation of iron if indicated.

--- page 134 ---

# European Formulas 

European formulas for infants have several differences compared with formulas produced in the United States and regulated by the FDA. First, the labels of European formula may not be in English. Mixing of European infant formulas can vary from formulas manufactured in the United States, including units of measurement, which presents a concern for appropriate mixing and safety. There are generally 2 stages of formulas for ages $0-6$ months and $6-12$ months. Both stages require docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)/arachidonic acid (ARA) to be added per the European formula guidelines. The iron content required in European formula is 0.2 mg per serving, compared with 1 mg per serving required in the United States by the FDA. ${ }^{5,6}$ Families should be cautious when purchasing European formula from third-party vendors because the consumer protections of the FDA are bypassed, which increases safety risks such as tampering, contamination, and suboptimal nutrient composition. ${ }^{7}$

## Concentration

Infants may require concentrated infant formula if their fluid volume is limited and/or energy needs are increased. Table 5-6 provides recipes for many powdered infant formulas. Formula concentrates may come in various volumes; the use of Table 5-7 is appropriate with 13-oz cans of formula concentrate. Recipes should always be verified before using in an institution or supplying to a patient.

# Functional Ingredients 

## Docosahexaenoic Acid/Arachidonic Acid

DHA and ARA are long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids that are synthesized from the dietary EFAs $\alpha$-linolenic acid and linoleic acid. DHA and ARA are present in human milk and added to infant formulas voluntarily in the United States.

## Prebiotics

Prebiotics are fermentable carbohydrates that are not fully digested in the small intestine and promote the growth of normal gut flora and limit

--- page 136 ---

pathogenic bacteria. Fermentation produces short-chain fatty acids that can be used for energy by colonocytes. Short-chain galactooligosaccharides and long-chain fructo-oligosaccharides are studied the most and have demonstrated benefits of stool softening, reduced infections, and modulation of the immune system.

Human milk oligosaccharides are prebiotics that may be added to infant formulas. ${ }^{8}$

# Probiotics 

Probiotics consist of nonpathogenic bacteria that change microflora in the intestine and may promote the development of the infant's immune system and decrease inflammation. ${ }^{8}$

## Synbiotics

Synbiotics are a combination of both probiotics and prebiotics. They may be beneficial, but more studies are needed. ${ }^{8}$

## Postbiotics

Postbiotics consist of inactivated microbial cells with demonstrated health benefits. They are more stable than probiotics in industrial process and storage because they are not sensitive to heat or oxygen.

Formulas fermented withBifidobacterium breve C50 andStreptococcus thermophilus are available in some parts of the world. There is no clear evidence of the benefit of one formula over another. The recommendation for health care providers is to determine whether the potential benefits outweigh costs. ${ }^{9}$

## Human Milk Oligosaccharides

More than 100 human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) have been identified in human milk. They are the third most abundant solid component in human milk after lactose and lipids. A trisaccharide consisting of glucose, galactose, and fructose, 2'-fucosyllactose (2'-FL),

--- page 137 ---

is the most abundant HMO in most human milk analyzed. The HMO 2'FL is thought to act as a prebiotic with additional gut, immune, and cognition benefits. A structurally identical $2^{\prime}$-FL has been synthesized and added to infant formulas to support immune and gut health. ${ }^{10}$

Lacto- N -neotetraose is a tetra-saccharide also added to infant formulas. ${ }^{8}$

Pediatric enteral product options continue to increase as alternative formulas for specific disease states, nutrient content, and consumer desire are created. Most standard pediatric enteral formulas that include vitamins and minerals meet the micronutrient needs of children ages 110 in $1000 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{d}$. Adult formulas may be considered for children when deemed appropriate for disease state or nutrient needs.

## Oral Supplements

Oral supplements are intended to supplement insufficient oral diets and may not be appropriate for sole-source nutrition intakes. They are available in standard pediatric, adult, semi-elemental, and elemental varieties.

## Pediatric Elemental Enteral Formulas

Pediatric elemental enteral formulas are the sole-source nutrition indicated for malabsorption or multiple food allergies. They are a protein source of $100 \%$ free amino acids and the macronutrient content varies among formulas within the category. See Appendix 5-9.

## Pediatric Semi-Elemental/Hydrolysate Enteral Formulas

Pediatric semi-elemental/hydrolysate enteral formulas are the sole-source nutrition designed for malabsorption or intolerance to polymeric formula. See Appendix 5-10.

- Protein content of peptides derived from hydrolyzed whey or soy protein

--- page 138 ---

- Higher amount of fat from medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) than polymeric formula
- Available in $1 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mL}$ and $1.5 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mL}$


# Pediatric Polymeric Complete Enteral Formulas 

Pediatric polymeric complete enteral formulas are sole-source nutrition indicated for tube feeding for children with normal GI function. See Appendix 5-11.

- May be flavored or unflavored
- Milk-based, lactose-free, soy, and pea protein option
- Available with and without fiber
- Caloric densities: $0.67 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mL}, 1 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mL}, 1.5 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mL}$


## Pediatric Whole Food-Based Enteral Formulas

Some pediatric whole food-based enteral formula varieties are tailored to sole-source nutrition, whereas others are only supplemental and require micronutrient analysis and supplementation. See Appendix 5-12.

- The protein source may be plant or meat based.
- They differ in caloric densities: 1.1 to $1.4 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mL}$
- They may need to be diluted to be thin enough to be safely and effectively administered.


## Other Specialized Pediatric Enteral Formulas

For other specialized pediatric enteral formulas, consider the following:

- Ketogenic: Ratios of 3:1 and 4:1 available in standard protein or semi-elemental varieties (see chapter 23, "Seizures," for more information)
- Altered fat content: Increased MCTs and low long-chain triglycerides (LCTs)
- Renal disease: Liquid and powdered formulas available (see chapter 19, "Renal Disease")
- Metabolic diseases: Modified amino acid content, altered fat content, and protein-free formulas (see chapter 17, "Inborn Errors of Metabolism," for more details)


## Adult Formula

Adult formulas may be indicated for use in pediatric patients with increased protein needs because of the higher protein content than most pediatric formulas. Additionally, adult formulas may be used in pediatric patients with certain disease states because of differing macronutrient or

--- page 139 ---

micronutrient content. When adult formulas are used in pediatric patients, total micronutrient intakes should be evaluated. See chapter 4, "Infant to Adolescent," for dietary reference intakes. Adult formulas, like pediatric formulas, are available in the categories of polymeric, semi-elemental, elemental, and specialized formulas. See Appendixes 5-13 through 5-16.

# Modular Macronutrients 

Modulars can be used to increase the calorie, protein, and/or fat content of formula.

- Protein:
- Liquid or powder
- Intact or extensively hydrolyzed
- Pureed baby food meats
- May alter osmolarity of formula significantly
- Carbohydrate:
- Liquid or powder
- Table sugar, juice, corn starch
- May significantly alter osmolarity of formula
- Fat:
- MCTs or LCTs

Combination products with varying contents of carbohydrate, protein, or fat available

## Formula Safety

Enteral formulas are shelf stable. Once the container is opened, it can be covered and stored for 24 hours in the refrigerator. Formula mixed from powder can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours.

## Recommended Hang Time

Recommended hang times for enteral formulas are as follows:

- Formula from powder, formula with additives, and human milk: 4 hours
- Sterile, ready-to-feed formula: 8 hours
- Closed system: 24 hours
- Home blended: 2 hours ${ }^{11}$

--- page 140 ---

# Administration 

## Bolus Feeds

Bolus feeds can only be administered into the stomach via a nasogastric (NG) tube or gastrostomy tube because the stomach provides a reservoir for the feeding, and feeds should not be administered into the jejunum.

## Gravity Feeds

In gravity feeds formula is placed into a feeding syringe and allowed to flow into the tube.

- Minimal equipment is required.
- The rate of administration can be changed by how far the feeding is from the patient. Holding the syringe higher will achieve faster flow, and holding the syringe near the patient will slow the flow.


## Syringe Feeds

In syringe feeds, formula is put into the feeding syringe, and a plunger is used to administer the feeds from the syringe into the patient.

- The rate of administration can be controlled.
- Syringe feeds may be required for the administration of blended tube feeds because of the viscosity.


## Pump-Assisted Feeds

Pump-assisted feeds require a pump, pole, and necessary supplies.

- Required for jejunal feedings
- More options for feeding rate and duration


## Continuous Feeds

Continuous feeds require a feeding pump and can be administered in the stomach or small intestine. If patient is mobile, may also require a backpack or bag to transport feeding pump and formula. Pump may be cycled to allow time off.

--- page 141 ---

# Initiation of Formula 

EN schedules and delivery methods are patient dependent and should be adjusted based on tolerance of feedings, demonstrated growth, and family preference if the patient is to have home tube feedings. Clinicians should consider the risk of refeeding syndrome when designing the initiation and advancement plans for EN. Slower initiation and advancement and monitoring of electrolytes and physical examination are advised. Table 58 discusses the initiation, advancement, and potential goal volumes of enteral feedings. See Appendix 5-1 for EN regimen examples.

## TABLE 5-8. Initiation, Advancement, and Proposed Goal Volumes of Enteral Feedings

| Age | Continuous Feeds |  |  | Bolus Feeds |  |  |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |

## Tolerance of Formula

Diarrhea, constipation, delayed gastric emptying, and vomiting may all be signs of formula intolerance. It is important to examine all potential

--- page 142 ---

causes and interventions to improve the symptoms. See Table 5-9 for common interventions for symptoms of tube feeding intolerance.

# TABLE 5-9. Common Enteral Nutrition-Related Complications and Interventions 

| Problem | Potential Interventions |
| :--: | :--: |
| Constipation | - Evaluate fluid intake to ensure meeting goals <br> - Change to formula with fiber <br> - Evaluate medications for bowel regimen |
| Delayed gastric emptying | - Position patient upright <br> - Change to lower fat formula <br> - Decrease rate of infusion and/or extend time of bolus <br> - Change to continuous feeds <br> - Use room-temperature formula <br> - Consider postpyloric tube placement |
| Diarrhea | - Look at medications that may be causing diarrhea (especially liquid medications that contain sorbitol) <br> - Decrease osmolality <br> - Evaluate fiber intake, considering providing a mix of fiber <br> - Assess for infection/illness <br> - Consider peptide-based formula with evidence of malabsorption |
| Nausea/vomiting | - Position patient upright or elevate head of bed <br> - Provide room-temperature formula <br> - Decrease rate of bolus feeds or transition to continuous feeds <br> - Reduce volume by concentrating formula <br> - Trial peptide-based or elemental formula <br> - Consider postpyloric feedings |

Changes in tolerance of formula may also indicate acute illness or changes in chronic illness management, which should be evaluated if interventions do not improve symptoms.

--- page 143 ---

# Nutrition-Focused Physical Examination Related to Enteral Nutrition 

Nutrition-focused physical examination (NFPE) is an important tool for clinicians' evaluation of patients receiving EN. Following a head-to-toe assessment method, practitioners should assess for muscle wasting, fat loss, hydration status, and signs of micronutrient deficiencies. Anthropometric measurements should be evaluated to see whether what is recorded in the medical record matches a visual assessment. Additionally, measurements such as mid-upper arm circumference or triceps skin fold may be completed. ${ }^{12}$

For infants and children without known malabsorption issues who are receiving adequate volumes of formula appropriate for sole-source nutrition to meet micronutrient intakes, a physical examination should be tailored to signs of muscle wasting, fat loss, and hydration status while observing for any signs of micronutrient deficiencies (see chapter 1, "Nutrition Screening and History," for further discussion on NFPE). NFPE should also include a more thorough evaluation of signs and symptoms of micronutrient deficiencies in the following situations:

- Volume of feeds not adequate to meet minimum micronutrient requirements for age without additional supplementation
- Use of home-blended tube feeds, formulas that are not FDA regulated, or formulas that do not have added micronutrients
- Enteral regimens with low provisions of any macronutrients (low fat, low carbohydrate, low protein)
- Known malabsorptive condition or chronic GI losses
- Receiving micronutrient supplementation or other dietary supplements
- Patients with unknown or inconsistent total intakes of enteral formula
- Partial enteral feeds with oral or parenteral nutrition intakes

See chapter 1, "Nutrition Screening and History," Table 1-12 for physical examination findings associated with nutrient deficiencies.

## Medication Administration

Consider the following for medication administration in patients receiving EN:

--- page 144 ---

- Site, size, and type of feeding tube
- Formulation of medication
- Drug-nutrient interactions
- Safety


# Feeding Tube Sites 

## Gastric Access

Gastric access is the preferred administration site if a patient is unable to take medication orally. Generally, larger-bore tubes decrease the risk of clogging.

- The stomach is more tolerant of hypertonic medications than the jejunum.
- A bolus feeding schedule may be used, allowing medication and feeds to be separated for fewer concerns with drug-nutrient interactions and tube clogging. ${ }^{13}$
- EN should be held 30 minutes before and after administration of ketoconazole, penicillin, and tetracyclines that should be administered on an empty stomach. ${ }^{14}$


## Jejunal Access

The following are considerations for jejunal access:

- Hypertonic medications should be diluted with $10-30 \mathrm{~mL}$ of sterile water before administration to avoid bloating, nausea, cramping, and diarrhea. ${ }^{13}$
- Medications with minimal effects if not administered into the stomach include calcium carbonate, sucralfate, and bismuth.
- There is decreased bioavailability if ketoconazole and itraconazole are not administered into the stomach as a result of the need for acidic activation.
- Some medications may have increased absorption and greater systemic effects when administered into the jejunum, including opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, betablockers, and nitrates. ${ }^{13,14}$
- There is decreased bioavailability of iron, warfarin, and tacrolimus if administered into the jejunum as a result of usual absorption in the duodenum or proximal to the jejunum. ${ }^{14}$


## Medication Formulation

## Liquid Preparations

The preferred method of administering medications via enteral tubes in most scenarios is by using a liquid preparation. Table 5-10 discusses liquid medication preparations.

--- page 145 ---

TABLE 5-10. Liquid Medication Preparation

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| :-- | :-- |
| Less likely to cause to <br> cause tube occlusions | Syrups may cause clumping when exposed to formula. <br> c |
| Readily absorbed | Large volumes may be needed for older children or adult <br> patients, especially if dilution is needed. <br> a |
| Less preparation <br> required. <br> a | May be hyperosmolar or contain sorbitol leading to GI <br> discomfort or diarrhea. <br> a-c |

If a liquid preparation is not available or inappropriate with enteral feedings, certain solid-dose forms of medications can be used.

# Tablets 

Medications that are immediate release and sugar or film coated may be crushed with minimal pharmacokinetic changes to the drug. Tablets should be crushed with a mortar and pestle, then mixed with $15-30 \mathrm{~mL}$ of water for administration.

## Capsules

Hard gelatin capsules may be opened and the contents diluted in 10-15 mL of water to make a slurry for administration. ${ }^{13-15}$ Soft gelatin capsules may be dissolved in warm water and all of the contents given to ensure the entire dose of medication is provided. The undissolved gelatin portion of the capsule should be removed prior to administration. ${ }^{13,14}$

--- page 146 ---

# Dose Forms Not Appropriate for Enteral Administration 

Dose forms not appropriate for enteral administration include the following:

- Enteric-coated products should not be crushed because it may cause adverse effects in the stomach, decreased drug effectiveness from destruction by gastric acid, or clumping of enteric pieces and clogging of the feeding tube. ${ }^{13,14}$
- Buccal or sublingual preparations should not be administered via EADs because they are not designed for absorption in the GI tract and may cause reduced absorption and decreased efficacy.
- Medications with carcinogenic, teratogenic, or cytotoxic properties should not be crushed because of the risk of aerosolized particles that could harm the person administering the medication.
- Extended-release capsules may be opened and the contents administered via an EAD if appropriate; however, crushing the capsules is not recommended because it may lead to toxic peaks and low troughs of medications. ${ }^{15}$


## Safety

Medications should only be drawn up and dispensed in oral syringes to avoid accidental parenteral administration of an oral formulation of medication. ${ }^{13,15}$ If the formulation of the medication is changing, attention should be paid to need for adjusting dose or frequency.

## Drug-Formula Incompatibilities

Medications (other than liquid electrolytes) should not be added to enteral formula because of the following risks:

- Physical incompatibilities with acidic syrup and elixirs denaturing the protein in formula (seen more often with intact protein formulas than hydrolyzed or free amino acid formulas) ${ }^{13-15}$
- Decreased drug absorption
- Increased risk of tube occlusions
- Potential microbial contamination
- Suboptimal drug dosing if tube feeding is interrupted ${ }^{13}$


## Administration of Medication

Medications should be given as a bolus and separated from EN when possible, using the following procedure:

--- page 147 ---

1. Flush feeding tube with $15-30 \mathrm{~mL}$ water.
2. Administer medication after diluting with water if appropriate.
3. If multiple medications are being provided, flush with $5-10 \mathrm{~mL}$ water between each medication.
4. Flush feeding tube with $15-30 \mathrm{~mL}$ water.

Adequate flushing of an EAD maintains patency of the tube, reduces risk of occlusion, and ensures drug delivery. ${ }^{13,14}$ In smaller children, smaller water flush volumes are recommended. ${ }^{13,15}$ Dilution of medication should also be with smaller volumes in pediatric patients. A minimum of 50:50 medication and water should be used with a $5-\mathrm{mL}$ water flush if not restricted in volume. ${ }^{15}$

When administering medication with continuous feeding, EN may need to be interrupted multiple times per day depending on the frequency of dosing. It may be necessary to alter the feeding rate to compensate for time that formula was held during drug delivery, particularly if the medications provided require administration on an empty stomach. With bolus and intermittent feeding schedules, medication can generally be scheduled around feedings.

# Drug-Nutrient Interactions 

ASPEN recommends stopping feeds for 30 minutes before and after administration of drugs whose absorption properties are affected by EN, such as the following.

- Ciprofloxacin
- Doxycycline
- Isoniazid
- Levofloxacin
- Ofloxacin
- Penicillin
- Rifampicin
- Phenytoin
- Carbamazepine
- Theophylline
- Strontium
- Aluminum
- Magnesium
- Calcium-containing preparations ${ }^{14}$

--- page 148 ---

Other studies suggest a longer duration of feeding interruptions of 12 hours before and after administration. ${ }^{16}$ Collaboration with a pharmacist should occur when starting new medications or initiating EN to ensure the appropriate safety and administration of medications with EN.

# APPENDIX 5-1. Sample Enteral Nutrition Plan for Pediatric and Infant Patients 

## Pediatric Patient

Patient: 8-year-old female with a history of complex congenital heart disease. She has a gastrostomy tube in place that has not been used for fluid or nutrition in several years. No malnutrition noted on admission for cardiac surgery, and parental report is that patient ate 3 meals per day plus snacks. She included all food groups and consumed portions sizes similar to her peers, although parents could not quantify. Beverages commonly consumed included water and $1 \%$ milk. No known food allergies or intolerance. When a gastrostomy tube was used in the past, a standard milk protein-based pediatric formula was tolerated. Postoperative course was complicated by bleeding, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, seizures, and spinal cord injury resulting in paralysis from the waist down.

- Height: $129 \mathrm{~cm}, 29$ th percentile, $-0.57 z$ score
- Weight: $28 \mathrm{~kg}, 45$ th percentile, $-0.13 z$ score
- Body mass index: $16.83 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{2}, 60$ th percentile, $0.27 z$ score


## Assessed Nutrition Needs

- Basal metabolic rate (BMR) (Schofield): 1063 kcal (38 kcal/kg)
- Estimated energy needs: $38-46 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{kg}$ [BMR - (BMR × 1.2)] with critical illness
- Estimated protein needs: $1.5-2 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg}$ with critical illness
- Estimated fluid needs: per team
- Micronutrient needs: recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for age

Trophic feeds initiated postoperative day 5 with standard non-fiber-containing formula at 15 mL every 3 hours via gastrostomy tube. Registered nurse noted formula coming out of orogastric tube when tube unclamped. With desire to advance feeds more rapidly, nasojejunal (NJ) tube was placed under fluoroscopy. Feeds resumed and advanced by $5 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{h}$ every 6 hours to goal of $50 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{h}$ for 1200 $\mathrm{mL}(43 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg}), 1200 \mathrm{kcal}(43 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{kg})$, and 36 g protein $(1.3 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg})$ with consideration of adding a protein modular once at goal feeds. Patient was monitored for signs and symptoms of refeeding syndrome. There was no change noted in electrolytes or nutrition-related physical examination.

After 6 days on NJ feeds, patient was noted to have improved bowel sounds and motility, with decreasing gastrostomy tube output and subsequent tolerance of gastrostomy tube clamped. Feeds were transitioned from NJ to gastrostomy tube continuous feeds. Bowel regimen started with MiraLAX, Senna, daily glycerin suppositories, and as-needed enemas because of difficulty stooling. Once full feedings were tolerated via gastrostomy tube, the formula was transitioned to standard fiber-containing formula, and protein modular was added to formula to increase protein intake, with slow-healing wound requiring a wound vac. By this time, patient had undergone diuresis postoperatively and was maintaining weights $27-29 \mathrm{~kg}$. Total fluid volume was still restricted, with numerous intravenous (IV)

--- page 151 ---

medications still providing additional fluid as well as clinical status not appropriate for additional fluids.

Patient proceeded to have tracheostomy placed. Postoperatively, feeds were transitioned from continuous to bolus feeding via gastrostomy tube: 240 mL over 2 hours for 5 feedings per day. Over the next several days, the time feeds were given over was decreased by $30 \mathrm{~min} / \mathrm{d}$ until feeds were given over 30 minutes 5 times per day. Patient passed a video fluoroscopic swallow study and was allowed to take liquids with the speech language pathologist, and she drank 60 mL of water twice daily. As IV medications were weaned, water flushes of 60 mL after each of 5 feedings were provided for a total volume of 420 mL water daily in addition to the 1200 mL of formula. Additional protein was continued until wounds were healed. Micronutrient supplementation was not needed because patient was receiving great than $1 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{d}$ of pediatric formula, which met the RDAs for age.

# Infant Patient 

Patient: 5-month-old female admitted with respiratory distress due to respiratory syncytial virus requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. Physical examination reveals well-nourished-appearing infant with no nutrition-related physical findings. Parents report home intakes of 5.5-6 oz 6 times per day of standard, milk-based infant formula for approximately $33-36 \mathrm{oz} / \mathrm{d}$ of total intakes when well. Intakes have been decreased to about $20 \mathrm{oz} / \mathrm{d}$ for the past 2 days. Parents confirm they follow the instructions on the can to mix the formula to 20 cal/oz. Infant has not trialed any other foods or beverages. Parents report no micronutrient supplementation.

- Length: $60 \mathrm{~cm}, 5$ th percentile, -1.68 z score
- Weight: $6 \mathrm{~kg}, 15$ th percentile, -1.04 z score
- Head circumference: $40 \mathrm{~cm}, 15$ th percentile, -1.02 z score
- Weight for length: 59th percentile, 0.23 z score

Review of the growth chart reveals age-appropriate weight gain and linear growth for age.

## Assessed Nutrition Needs

- RDA for age: $108 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{kg}, 2.2 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg}$ protein, home intakes reported at 110-120 $\mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{kg}$
- Estimated energy needs: $90-100 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ (while intubated)
- Estimated protein needs: $2.2-3 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$
- Estimated fluid needs: $100 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ minimum

Nasogastric (NG) bolus feeds begin the day of intubation with home infant formula of standard dilution at 30 mL every 4 hours and advanced by 30 mL every feeding to goal of 150 mL to provide $100 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$. Feeds are well tolerated.

Patient is extubated after 3 days and is cleared by speech language pathologist to start taking formula via bottle with every other feed. Patient is transitioned to a by

--- page 152 ---

mouth/NG bolus schedule, and feedings are increased to home intakes of 180 mL per feeding. She is able to take $40 \%-50 \%$ of feedings offered by mouth and is liberalized to take a bottle at each feeding time. After 2 days, intakes are consistently greater than $85 \%$ of feeding volumes with demonstrated weight gain meeting goals for age, and NG tube is removed. No micronutrient supplementation was added because patient was meeting needs with more than 1 L of infant formula intakes.

## Parenteral Nutrition

Elaina Szeszycki, PharmD

## Indications for Parenteral Nutrition

Parenteral nutrition (PN) is a therapeutic option for patients who are unable to tolerate an enteral diet. Prior to the initiation of PN, a complete evaluation of enteral delivery options should be considered. Consensus guidelines published by ASPEN in 2017 outlined appropriate PN use as follows ${ }^{1}$ :

- Identify clinical indicators for PN such as impaired gastrointestinal (GI) absorption, mechanical bowel obstruction, or motility disorders.
- Identify clinical scenarios in which PN may not be indicated.
- Ensure appropriate selection of vascular access devices.
- Take measures to ensure safe use of PN and decrease adverse effects.
- Ensure continual PN evaluation, including ongoing need.
- Transition to oral nutrition or enteral nutrition (EN) when feasible.
- Collaborate with multiple disciplines to ensure appropriate therapy decisions and outcomes.

The focus of this chapter is to provide a concise review of PN therapy including vascular access selection, initiation of PN, doses of macro- and micronutrients, PN monitoring, and long-term management.

## Vascular Access for PN

--- page 168 ---

Selection of a vascular access device for PN requires careful consideration that should account for length of catheter use, patient characteristics, vascular access history, location of PN administration (hospital vs home), and family input. ${ }^{1}$ Different peripheral and central access devices are available that carry their own risks and benefits. To assist with selection of a catheter, The Michigan Appropriateness Guide for Intravenous Catheters in Pediatrics (miniMAGIC) was developed to provide clinical guidance for selection of a vascular access device based on length of catheter use and type of intravenous (IV) solution. ${ }^{2}$ The miniMAGIC guidelines are summarized in Table 6-1. Table 6-2 highlights each catheter type, access location, advantages, and disadvantages. ${ }^{1,3-5}$ Figure 6-1 provides a pictorial representation of a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) and nontunneled and tunneled central venous catheters.

# PN Ordering and Safety Considerations 

PN is a complex IV solution that requires specialized expertise to ensure that the order is both safe and effective. Although PN can improve

--- page 171 ---

nutrition status, EN is still preferred over PN because of decreased complications and cost. ${ }^{6}$ The indication for PN must be carefully considered to determine appropriateness as use can expose patients to unnecessary procedures, potential harm, and increased costs. Assessment, prescription, and review are 3 important steps in the PN ordering process.

1. Assessment

- Evaluation of patient history
- Physical and caloric requirements
- Access options

2. Prescription

- Indication for PN
- Patient weight
- Macronutrients ordered as $\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ or $\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{d}$
- Order based on access (peripheral or central)
- Desired PN volume
- Nutrition goals for macronutrients
- Choice of electrolytes including decision for selection of cations and anions as determined by the patient's acid/base status ordered as $\mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ or $\mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{d}$
- Micronutrients (use of a commercially available trace metal package vs prescribing each individually)
- Multivitamins
- Additives (Carnitine, heparin, etc)

3. Review

- Appropriate route of administration
- Appropriate weight
- Current date and time
- Correct PN prescription form for weight and age
- Infusion rate within usual limits for weight and age ( $\mathrm{mL} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ or $\mathrm{mL} / \mathrm{h}$ )
- Macronutrients, micronutrient, medication additives within usual dosing limits
- Multivitamin ordered based on weight and age
- Trace minerals ordered based on weight and age
- Appropriate ordering units (grams, milligrams, micrograms, millimoles, etc)
- Calcium and phosphorus solubility within limits
- Formulation within all stability limits
- Osmolarity not exceeded if peripheral PN ordered

All disciplines should be involved in assessing, prescribing, ordering, administering, evaluating, and monitoring PN prescriptions daily. A multidisciplinary team review process creates an environment that allows each discipline to use their expertise to provide excellent patient care and outcomes. ${ }^{7}$

--- page 172 ---

# Access Considerations 

The type of access will determine whether a peripheral or central PN can be ordered. Central access is preferred for PN administration, especially for those patients who will require long-term IV nutrition. The use of peripheral nutrition is limited by the osmolarity of the solution that in turn limits the calorie content of the PN. Exhibit 6-1 lists the considerations for use of peripheral PN when this is the only access available. ${ }^{8}$

## EXHIBIT 6-1. Considerations for Peripheral Parenteral Nutrition

- Limited by osmolarity ( $60-900 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$ [institution specific])
- Generally, will not meet $100 \%$ of estimated calories and protein
- Used for short-term nutrition support (3-7 d) until transitioned to CPN or EN
- Maximum dextrose concentration $12.5 \%$
- Osmolarity driven by amino acids, dextrose, sodium, potassium, and calcium
- Monitor closely for phlebitis or infiltration of intravenous line

Abbreviations: CPN, central parenteral nutrition; EN, enteral nutrition.

## Use of 2-in-1 vs 3-in-1 PN

The PN can be ordered as amino acid/dextrose solution with the lipids co-infused (2-in-1) or all 3 macronutrients added to one bag (3-in-1). These types of PN can be customized for the needs of the individual patient. Commercially available premade solutions can be considered in select situations as an option, especially in times of product shortages. ${ }^{9}$ Advantages of the 3-in-1 PN includes compounding efficiency, less contamination risk during administration, and potential cost savings. ${ }^{8}$ Disadvantages of the 3-in-1 include potential for emulsion destabilization and medication incompatibility with the solution. ${ }^{8}$ When considering a 2-in-1 vs 3-in-1 formulation, the choice of formulation type may be dictated by the amount of access available for nutrition (number of lumens), current stability, compatibility information for PN, lipid formulation, and patient medications. ${ }^{10}$

--- page 173 ---

# Use of Filters and Photoprotection 

## Filters

Filters are available in a variety of sizes and are essential for trapping particulate matter, microbes, air, and large lipid droplets. Particulate matter can include rubber, silicone, fibers, and drug/mineral precipitates. Highlights of ASPEN's best practices for use of filters with PN include the following ${ }^{11}$ :

- Ensure pharmacist review of the stability and compatibility of the PN solution.
- Perform a visual inspection of the PN.
- If a 2-in-1 PN solution is ordered, the amino acids and dextrose should be set up first, and the infusion pump should be programmed before setting up the lipid infusion.
- Avoid co-administration of medications if possible.
- Ensure use of appropriate flushing techniques before and after medication administration.
- If a medication must be co-administered with the PN, the medication tubing should be attached at a Y-site above the filter.
- Medications that cannot be filtered should not be given with PN.
- Use a $1.2-\mu \mathrm{m}$ filter for all PN admixtures.


## Photoprotection

Components of the PN including lipid injectable emulsions (ILEs) can undergo oxidation when exposed to light, which leads to production of free radicals. ${ }^{12}$ Infants, especially those born prematurely, are at highest risk. Photoprotection recommendations from ASPEN include both the bag and infusion sets. ASPEN also recommends complete PN light protection starting during the compounding of the PN and continuing until the bag is completely infused. Complete implementation of these recommendations may not be feasible, but individual health care organizations should bring together experts to discuss how these recommendations could be achieved. ${ }^{12}$

## Calculating PN Fluid Requirements

The PN fluid volume is usually based on the patient's maintenance requirements. Other clinical factors can impact how much fluid the patient will require. For example, the volume may need to be increased

--- page 174 ---

for patients who have an increased amount of ostomy output or diarrhea. A volume less than maintenance fluid may be ordered for those patients with decreased renal, liver, or cardiac function. The Holliday-Segar method is frequently used to estimate maintenance fluid requirements in pediatric patients (see chapter 4, "Infant to Adolescent," Table 4-5). ${ }^{13}$

Individualized patient assessment, especially in the critically ill child, is necessary to determine if fluid needs are above or below maintenance fluid requirements because of changes in energy expenditure and electrolyte requirements. ${ }^{14}$

# Macronutrient Requirements 

## General

The amounts of amino acids, dextrose, and ILEs are based on individual requirements. Table 6-3 provides guidance on starting dose, advancements, and general requirements for each macronutrient. ${ }^{15}$ It may take up to $2-3$ days to reach goal calories and protein based on the patient's estimated nutrition requirements. The duration of time to goal may be even longer if a patient presents moderately to severely malnourished because these patients would require a slower increase to avoid refeeding.

Macronutrients are generally ordered in weight-based units such as $\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$, but in pediatric patients weighing greater than 40 kg , it may be acceptable to order them as $\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{d}$ to avoid overfeeding. Initial goals for calorie needs and protein requirements are listed in chapter 4, "Infant to Adolescent," Tables 4-1 and 4-2 These goals may need to be modified based on routine nutrition assessment by a multidisciplinary team. ${ }^{16}$

# Amino Acids 

Pediatric amino acid products are usually reserved for neonatal patients based on the original research but may still be used in younger pediatric patients and those with intestinal failure-associated liver disease (IFALD). ${ }^{17}$ The pediatric amino acid product decreases the risk of abnormal plasma amino acid levels due to reduced metabolism by

--- page 176 ---

immature and damaged livers. Standard amino acids are routinely used in the remainder of our pediatric patients similarly to adult patients. Amino acids provide energy of $4 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{g}$. Table 6-4 lists the differences in essential and nonessential amino acids between 2 currently available amino acid products. ${ }^{18,19}$

# TABLE 6-4. Amino Acid Variations Between Pediatric Amino Acids and Adult or Standard Amino Acids 

| Amino Acid Type | Pediatric Amino Acid | Standard Amino Acid |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Essential amino acids |  |  |
| Leucine (branched chain) | Higher | Lower |
| Isoleucine (branched chain) | Higher | Lower |
| Valine (branched chain) | Slightly higher | Slightly lower |
| Lysine | Similar | Similar |
| Histidine | Slightly lower | Slightly higher |
| Phenylalanine (aromatic) | Slightly lower | Slightly higher |
| Threonine | Similar | Similar |
| Methionine (sulfur containing) | Lower | Higher |
| Tyrosine (aromatic) | Higher | Lower |
| Tryptophan (aromatic) | Slightly higher | Slightly lower |
| Cysteine (sulfur containing) | Small amount | None |
| Nonessential amino acids |  |  |
| Arginine | Higher | Lower |
| Proline | Slightly higher | Slightly lower |
| Alanine | Lower | Higher |
| Glutamic acid | Similar | Similar |
| Serine | Similar | Similar |
| Glycine | Lower | Higher |
| Aspartic acid | Slightly higher | Slightly lower |
| Taurine (sulfur containing) | Small amount | None |

## Dextrose

--- page 177 ---

Carbohydrate calories are ordered as dextrose, which provides energy or $3.4 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{g}$. It is preferred to order dextrose using glucose infusion rate (GIR; $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{min}$ ) in neonates and young pediatric patients or $\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{d}$ in older pediatric patients. Use of percent final concentration should be avoided to prevent concentration errors and provide appropriate carbohydrate intake. ${ }^{20}$ The dextrose is advanced daily until the goal is reached as long as adequate blood glucose levels are maintained. Blood glucose levels should be monitored by daily serum or capillary glucose. Dextrose usually constitutes $60 \%-70 \%$ of nonprotein calories while lipid constitutes $30 \%-40 \%$ of nonprotein calories. The ratio or dose may vary based on blood glucose levels, triglyceride levels, carbon dioxide retention as a byproduct of carbohydrate metabolism, or development of IFALD. ${ }^{21,22}$

# Lipid Injectable Emulsions 

Lipid injectable emulsions (ILEs) provide a concentrated source of calories and essential fatty acids that are required for pediatric growth and development. ${ }^{23}$ ILEs provide $10 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{g}$ of energy. The first ILEs consisted of soybean oil, which contains a high concentration of omega-6 fatty acids, and phytosterols, which are thought to contribute to the development of IFALD. The availability of newer lipid emulsions has allowed clinicians to customize therapy based on individual patient needs. The choice of an ILE product should consider oil source, anticipated duration of PN use, and patient comorbidities. ${ }^{23}$ Use of soybean oil-based ILE (SO-ILE) should be limited to patients receiving short-term PN. Use of multi-oil ILEs (soy, medium-chain triglyceride [MCT], olive, fish oil-based ILE [SO,MCT,OO,FO-ILE]) should be considered for use in patients that require PN for a prolonged period of time. A fish oil-based ILE (FO-ILE) is indicated in patients who have established IFALD. ${ }^{23}$ Neonatal use of lipid emulsions will be discussed in chapter 7, "Neonatal Nutrition." Table 6-5 is a compilation of the available lipid emulsions and US Food and Drug Administrationapproved indications. Table 6-6 provides the composition of the various

--- page 178 ---

lipid emulsions. Table 6-7 provides dosing recommendations for the ILE products.

The maximum lipid infusion rate is not clearly established for pediatric patients, but there are studies to suggest an increased risk of hypertriglyceridemia when the infusion rate exceeds $0.15 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{h} .{ }^{23}$ It is recommended to not exceed this infusion rate and reevaluate the rate with each dose change or when cycling the PN to ensure that the infusion rate remains near or below the adult maximum.

# Micronutrients: Electrolytes 

Electrolytes play a large role in many physiologic functions and are added to PN solutions to maintain appropriate concentrations when the patient is unable to meet their needs enterally. The function of electrolytes is elaborated next ${ }^{24,25}$ :

- Sodium is the main cation in the extracellular fluid and is responsible for maintaining intravascular and interstitial fluid volumes and also supports growth and weight gain ${ }^{48}$.
- Potassium is the major intracellular cation and is responsible for neuromuscular function and protein/glycogen synthesis.
- Chloride and acetate are the 2 main anions that are responsible for acid/base balance and osmotic pressure. Typically, the dose of sodium in the PN is matched to the dose of chloride with the rest added as acetate. These 2 anions can be manipulated in the PN as acid/base status changes. One needs to be cautious when using only chloride or acetate in the PN as this could cause large shifts in acid-base balance.
- Calcium and phosphorus are very important for bone mineralization and growth. ${ }^{8}$ In addition, phosphorus is an important component of adenosine triphosphate. The optimal ratio for neonatal bone mineralization is a calcium to phosphorus ratio of $1.7: 1(\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{mg})$ or $1.3: 1(\mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{mmol}) .^{7}$ Both calcium and phosphorus are important for the maintenance of electric impulses.
- Magnesium is important for coenzyme activation and calcium and potassium homeostasis.

Abnormal fluid losses as the result of diarrhea, vomiting, high nasogastric tube, or ostomy output can impact serum electrolytes. Table 6-8 provides the estimated electrolyte concentrations for different GI body fluids, which may be helpful in determining electrolyte replacement dosing. ${ }^{24,26}$ Medications can also impact serum electrolytes. ${ }^{25}$ Any changes to the patient's medication regimen needs to be evaluated for any potential impact on electrolyte dosing. Table 6-9 provides some of the medication classes that can impact serum electrolytes.

Monitoring of drug interactions with PN electrolytes and adjustment is an important role of the pharmacist. Electrolyte dosing for pediatric patients is based on weight and should not exceed adult starting doses (Table 6-10). Metabolic monitoring will constitute the most frequent monitoring (Table 6-11), especially early on in PN therapy, so that tolerance can be established. Electrolyte monitoring should occur daily

--- page 186 ---

for new PN starts. Once the patient is on a stable formulation, weekly or twice weekly electrolyte monitoring is possible. ${ }^{27}$

# Micronutrients: Multivitamins 

IV multivitamins provide the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K; watersoluble B vitamins; and ascorbic acid. Multivitamins are a routine addition to daily PN solutions. A dose of $2 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ (maximum 5 mL ) is used for pediatric patients up to 11 years of age. An adult multivitamin dose of 10 mL is used for patients greater than 11 years. Table 6-12 provides a comparison of both pediatric and adult multivitamin IV products currently available. ${ }^{28}$

# Micronutrients: Trace Metals 

Trace metals represent a very small component of normal dietary intake. ${ }^{29}$ These micronutrients play an essential role in a variety of physiologic processes such as immune support, bone growth, and wound healing. Deficiencies of trace metals can occur when intake is inadequate or abnormal losses (GI tract) are present, which lead to adverse effects (see Table 6-13). ${ }^{27,30}$ If acute deficiencies are suspected, trace metal levels should be obtained. See "Long-Term PN Management" section in this chapter for recommendations on monitoring trace metals for patients on long-term PN. Trace metals can be provided in the PN solution as either individual components or as a trace metal package. Trace metals should be provided within a few days on PN initiation. ${ }^{31}$ Table 6-14 lists the ingredients for the currently available trace metal packages in the United States. ${ }^{32,33}$ The package insert lists the dose in $\mathrm{mL} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ or $\mathrm{mL} / \mathrm{d}$

--- page 189 ---

based on weight, or institutions may develop a standardized protocol for ease of ordering. Manganese and chromium are contaminants of other IV products used to compound PN , so the need to supplement may not be required. In patients who are on long-term PN or neonates who are at risk for accumulation of these minerals, the use of the individual trace element products may be more appropriate for some patients. Individualized dosing will also allow for higher doses based on serum levels or increased need in certain populations. ${ }^{34}$ Dosing of the individual trace metals can be found in Table 6-15. ${ }^{15}$ A sample case with subsequent PN recommendations is outlined in Appendix 6-1.

# Other Micronutrients and Additives: Heparin, Carnitine, and Iron 

Medication additives may be added to a PN solution based on patient need and compatibility with other PN ingredients. Heparin can be added at lower concentrations $(0.5-1 \mathrm{U} / \mathrm{mL})$ to central neonatal and pediatric PN solutions to aid in maintaining patency. Central venous line patency

--- page 192 ---

issues are common in neonatal and pediatric patients because of the small inner lumens of pediatric central line catheters, low infusion rates, and frequent infusion interruptions or co-infusion of medications based on compatibility information. ${ }^{35,36}$

Carnitine is a quaternary ammonium compound that is synthesized from lysine and methionine and is responsible for the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria. It is present in a general diet but not in PN unless added separately. It is considered an essential nutrient in patients with renal disease on a dialysis modality, liver disease, preterm infants, metabolic disorders resulting in carnitine deficiency, and patients dependent on PN. The dose ranges from 5 to $20 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ depending on the indication and can be monitored periodically to ensure that the dose does not need to be adjusted. ${ }^{37,38}$

Patients dependent on PN routinely develop iron deficiency anemia (IDA) because of inadequate enteral intake, inability to absorb enough iron, blood loss related to mucosal inflammation or iatrogenic blood draws, and no iron in the injectable multivitamin. Once IDA is diagnosed, based on the severity, parenteral iron may be a reasonable solution to improve iron stores and subsequent anemia status. IV iron, although effective, can be associated with a variety of side effects from nausea to anaphylaxis. Allergies and comorbidities such as asthma and prior infusion history should be evaluated before ordering IV iron. Administering IV iron in a health care setting is ideal so that appropriate monitoring and necessary supportive care can be performed. If the patient has received multiple infusions without incident, infusions of IV iron in the home may be considered with close monitoring by home nursing. Product selection is dependent on the age, weight, total dose required, convenience for the patient and family, insurance coverage, and prior infusion history. ${ }^{39,40}$ See Table 6-16 for comparison of frequently used IV products. ${ }^{41}$

# Medication Compatibility With PN 

Compatibility questions are a frequent occurrence with PN to pediatric patients because of limited vascular access and volume concerns. Although infusing PN with or without lipids in a dedicated lumen is ideal as an infection prevention strategy, it may be impossible. It may be necessary to determine what medications and fluids can be added to PN or co-infused with PN. If there is no information available, or there is an incompatibility present, the nurse, pharmacist, and physician will need to

--- page 196 ---

discuss alternatives, which may include more access, brief PN pause, change to enteral, change to compatible fluid, and so forth. Exhibit 6-2 lists a variety of considerations when reviewing medication and fluid compatibility with PN. ${ }^{42}$

# EXHIBIT 6-2. Considerations When Reviewing Medication Compatibility With PN 

- Medication concentration tested as a Y-site, additive, or in a syringe
- Diluent of medication
- Concentration of amino acid and dextrose in PN
- Total nutrient admixture (3-in-1 or 2-in-1)
- Electrolyte, mineral, vitamin, trace mineral additives, and medications (ie, heparin) in PN
- Organic or inorganic salts in PN
- Type, pH , inactive ingredients, salts, in amino acid product
- Type, pH , globule size in lipid product
- Temperature of testing conditions
- Duration of testing conditions
- Container used for testing

Abbreviation: PN, parenteral nutrition.

## Drug and Enteral Formula Shortages

Awareness of drug and enteral formula shortages are a part of the medical and nutrition support team's responsibility to ensure that appropriate alternatives are prescribed and increased monitoring is ordered as needed to identify deficiencies or toxicities early on in the shortage period. All PN ingredients have been affected at one time or another so communication among pharmacists, dietitians, nurses, care managers, home infusion providers, and medical providers is critical to avoid shortage related complications. The ASPEN website (www.nutritioncare.org) contains useful information regarding what ingredients are short and how they might be managed. ${ }^{43}$

## Assessing Tolerance to PN

--- page 197 ---

Once the PN is at goal, constant monitoring and evaluation of PN adequacy begins. Exhibit 6-3 lists the parameters used to accomplish this evaluation. The rate at which these parameters change will vary based on age but should still be increasing over time because of the expectation of growth in children. Mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC), wound healing, and functional capacity are helpful measures when weight is not useful as in our patients with critical illness, liver disease, renal disease, or cardiac failure. Assessment of weight change may be difficult to interpret based on a patient's clinical status or disease process, but it is still of utmost importance to determine the etiology of weight variance and if PN volume requires adjustment. Table 6-17 lists signs and symptoms that may assist in this evaluation.

# EXHIBIT 6-3. Parameters to Evaluate Adequacy of PN Order 

- Weight
- Length or height
- Head circumference
- Weight gain
- Linear/occipital frontal circumference gain
- MUAC
- Skin or wound healing
- Functional capacity (energy and strength)

As macronutrients are advanced, monitoring for hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and azotemia will determine if advancement to goal can continue or if modification is required. Electrolyte and mineral laboratory monitoring along with evaluation of intake and outputs (see Tables 6-11, 6-17, and 6-18) will guide the need for adjustments. Once electrolytes and calories are stable, the frequency of metabolic monitoring can be reduced. Baseline liver and coagulation numbers are useful to determine if there is any cholestasis, hepatic inflammation, or

--- page 199 ---

vitamin K deficiency present prior to initiation of PN and any need for consistent monitoring of these parameters early in PN therapy.

# Refeeding Syndrome 

Refeeding syndrome (RS) occurs in patients who have had prolonged undernutrition, especially with continued electrolyte losses. ${ }^{44}$ Patients who may be at increased risk of RS include those with anorexia nervosa, malabsorption, failure to thrive, mental disorders, or critical illness. ${ }^{44}$ Hallmark features of RS include hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia. ${ }^{44}$ Thiamine deficiency can also be caused by RS as its demand increases dramatically during the transition from starvation to feeding. Thiamine is a cofactor for glucose dependent metabolic pathways. Thiamine deficiency can manifest as neurological abnormalities or oculomotor abnormalities. ${ }^{44}$ ASPEN has published consensus recommendations for identifying and management of pediatric patients with RS (see Tables 6-19 and 6-20).

# TABLE 6-20. ASPEN Consensus Recommendations for Avoidance and Management of RS in At-Risk Pediatric Patients 

| Aspect of <br> Care | Recommendations |
| :-- | :-- |
| Initiation of <br> nutrition | - Initiate nutrition at a maximum of 40\%-50\% goal, but usually <br> starting the glucose infusion rate around $4-6 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{min}$ and <br> advancing by $1-2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{min}$ daily as blood glucose levels allow <br> until you reach a max of $14-18 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{min}$. This includes enteral <br> as well as parenteral glucose. <br> - Calories from IV dextrose solutions and medications being infused <br> in dextrose should be considered in the aforementioned limits <br> and/or initiated with caution in patients at moderate to severe risk <br> for RS. If the patient is already receiving IV dextrose for several <br> days and/or medications in dextrose and has been asymptomatic <br> with stable electrolytes, calories from nutrition may be reintroduced <br> at a higher amount than recommended here. |
| Fluid <br> restriction | No recommendation |
| Sodium <br> restriction | No recommendation |
| Protein <br> restriction | No recommendation |
| Electrolytes | - Check serum potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus before <br> initiation of nutrition. <br> - Monitor every 12 h for the first 3 d in high-risk patients. May be <br> more frequent based on clinical picture. <br> - Replete low electrolytes based on established standards of care. <br> - No recommendation can be made for whether prophylactic dosing <br> of electrolytes should be given if prefeeding levels are normal. <br> - If electrolytes become difficult to correct or drop precipitously <br> during the initiation of nutrition, decrease calories/grams of <br> dextrose by 50\% and advance the dextrose/calories by <br> approximately 33\% of goal every 1-2 d based on clinical <br> presentation. Recommendations may be changed based on <br> practitioner judgment and clinical presentation, and cessation of <br> nutrition support may be considered when electrolyte levels are <br> severely and/or life-threateningly low or dropping precipitously. |

--- page 203 ---

| Aspect of <br> Care | Recommendations |
| :-- | :-- |
| Thiamin and <br> multivitamins | - Thiamin $2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ to a max of $100-200 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ before feeding <br> commences or before initiating IV fluids containing dextrose in <br> high-risk patients. <br> - Continue thiamin supplementation for 5-7 d or longer in patients <br> with severe starvation, chronic alcoholism, or other high risk for <br> deficiency and/or signs of thiamin deficiency. <br> - Routine thiamin levels are unlikely to be of value. <br> - MVI is added to PN daily, unless contraindicated, as long as PN is <br> continued. For patients receiving oral/enteral nourishment, add <br> complete oral/enteral multivitamin once daily for 10 d or greater <br> based on clinical status and mode of therapy. <br> - Once patient is within adult weight ranges, refer to adult <br> multivitamin recommendations. |
| Monitoring <br> and long- <br> term care | - Recommend vital signs every 4 h for the first 24 h after initiation in <br> those at risk. <br> - Cardiorespiratory monitoring is recommended for unstable patients <br> or those with severe deficiencies, based on established standards <br> of care. <br> - Daily weights with monitored intake and output. <br> - Estimation of energy requirements as needed for oral feeding <br> patients. <br> - Evaluate short- and long-term goals for nutrition care daily during <br> the first several days until the patient is deemed stabilized (eg, no <br> requirement for electrolyte supplementation for 2 d) and then <br> based on institutional standards of care. |

# Managing Discontinuation of PN 

As EN intake improves, PN can be decreased in a stepwise fashion. The volume and rate, macronutrient doses, and micronutrient doses can be decreased by a percentage based on EN advancement until the PN is less than $30 \%-50 \%$ intake. The doses should be low enough to allow for

--- page 204 ---

discontinuation. Cyclic PN can be considered in patients who are able to eat but experience poor appetite while receiving PN or for those who will be discharged on home PN . PN can be transitioned from 24 to 12 hours over 3-4 days based on amount of EN intake and blood glucose levels measured at the high rate of PN cycle and when off PN. There are a variety of methods to taper up and taper down, but generally, a smaller rate is infused for $30-60$ minutes for $1-2$ hours at the beginning of the infusion and at the end of the infusion with a higher rate for the middle hours. As the infant grows and receives more EN, the PN infusion time can be decreased as mentioned previously. ${ }^{45}$ A general rule of thumb is to not exceed twice maintenance volume for any hourly rate. If blood glucose is greater than $150 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$, consider decreasing the GIR or if hypoglycemia is present when patient off PN, consider increasing PN hours or tapering PN over a longer period at the end of the cyclic infusion. ${ }^{46}$

# Nutrition-Focused Physical Examination for PN 

Nutrition-focused physical examination (NFPE) is an important piece of the nutrition evaluation of patients receiving PN. Following a head-to-toe assessment method, evaluation of muscle wasting, fat loss, hydration status, and signs of micronutrient deficiencies is essential. Recorded anthropometrics should be evaluated against physical examination to assess accuracy. Additional measurements of MUAC and triceps skinfold may be completed. Patients receiving PN should have hair, eyes, mouth, skin, and nails evaluated, paying particular attention to signs of copper, selenium, zinc, iron, vitamin A, and vitamin D deficiencies. See chapter 1, "Nutrition Screening and History," for more details on NFPE.

## Long-Term PN Management

If PN continues for weeks to months, then it is considered long-term PN, and metabolic monitoring frequency may be adjusted based on stability of the patient. Increasing the interval between blood draws may decrease

--- page 205 ---

the anemia associated with chronic disease and iron-deficient anemia. The need for nutrition-related monitoring as listed in Tables 6-11 and 618 will now be required in prolonged PN because of the risk of vitamin and mineral deficiencies. ${ }^{47}$

# TABLE 6-18. Frequency of Long-Term Nutrition-Related Monitoring 

| Parameter | Initial | Follow-Up |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Iron studies | 3 mo | Every 3-6 mo |
| Zinc | $2-3$ mo | Every 3-6 mo |
| Selenium | $2-3$ mo | Every 3-6 mo |
| Copper | $2-3$ mo | Every 3-6 mo |
| Manganese | $2-3$ mo | Every 6-12 mo if in PN |
| Chromium | $2-3$ mo | Every 6-12 mo if in PN |
| Vitamin D | $2-3$ mo | Every 3-6 mo |
| Prothrombin/INR | Baseline if <br> indicated | Every 1-3 mo |
| Essential fatty acid panel | $3-6$ mo | Every 6-12 mo |
| Carnitine profile | 3 mo | Every 6-12 mo |
| Thyroid function tests and urine <br> iodine | 3 mo | Every 3-6 mo |

Patients on long-term PN generally receive no to minimal EN or are unable to adequately absorb enough EN for enteral autonomy and therefore are at risk for a variety of nutrition deficiencies. Multivitamin and trace minerals are added to PN but may provide too much or too little supplement, which is why periodic monitoring is required with

--- page 206 ---

subsequent additive modification. If individual injectable vitamins, minerals, and other nutrient additives are not available from a manufacturer or are in short supply, enteral supplements can be initiated with close monitoring.

Growth and development are monitored routinely by a multidisciplinary team through clinic, virtual, or phone visits with subsequent adjustments in PN with the goal of EN autonomy as able. Monitoring for mechanical complications such as infiltration, catheter dislodgement, thrombus, embolism, and catheter-related blood stream infections are continuous through the therapy. Clinicians rely on home infusion nurses and caregivers to monitor for signs and symptoms of these complications with immediate notification so that appropriate care can be administered. ${ }^{48}$ Education about sterile technique, limiting blood draws, and avoiding sick contacts are strategies used to decrease central line infections. Close communication with patient and caregivers can reinforce the aforementioned strategies and aid in evaluating the routine monitoring parameters.

# APPENDIX 6-1. Sample Parenteral Nutrition Plan 

T.B. is a 10-year-old patient with a past surgical history of gastroschisis repair who comes to the emergency department with abdominal pain and vomiting for the past 5 days and report of being unable to tolerate any food by mouth. An abdominal computed tomography scan demonstrated dilated bowel with air fluid levels. She was taken to the operating room (OR) where it was found she had adhesive bowel disease and underwent a lysis of adhesions. Her nutrition was assessed postoperatively, and she received a diagnosis of moderate malnutrition (weight-forlength $z$ score) of -2.3 . Based on findings in the OR (anticipated prolonged nothing-by-mouth status) and her nutrition, it was decided that parenteral nutrition (PN) therapy should be initiated. A peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line was placed by Interventional Radiology.

Admission weight: 30 kg
Allergies: No known drug allergy

## Overview

The nutrition needs for the growth and development of neonates and infants are unique compared with those of other pediatric populations because of physiologic immaturity and significant nutrition demands of growth. The nutrition support plan for these patients will depend on a detailed nutrition assessment, starting with an assessment of maturity by gestational age (GA), the birth weight classification, and size assessment for GA, which provides an indicator of the intrauterine growth history. ${ }^{1,2}$ The neonatal period refers to the first 28 days of infant life, and infants may be born full term, late preterm, or preterm (Table 7-1). ${ }^{3}$ Birth weight classification will help to determine nutrition needs (Table 7-2) and, along with size assessment (Table 7-3), will help to identify infants who may have increased nutrition risk and neonatal morbidities due an alteration in intrauterine growth. ${ }^{1}$ Growth is assessed regularly by using an appropriate growth chart, and the nutrition support plan is modified as needed to achieve goals. Hospitalized term and preterm infants often require specialized nutrition support (enteral and parenteral) because of increased energy and protein needs for growth, clinical status, immature oral feeding skills, and gastrointestinal (GI) immaturity. See Table 7-4 for indications for enteral nutrition (EN) and parenteral nutrition (PN) support. EN and PN require careful initiation, advancement, and monitoring and will be reviewed in this chapter.

| Moderate preterm | $32-34$ |
| Very preterm | $28-32$ |

# Growth Monitoring and Assessment 

Infant weight, length, and head circumference should be measured regularly and plotted on an appropriate chart. Preterm infants should be plotted on an intrauterine reference growth chart, and term infants should be plotted on the World Health Organization (WHO) growth standard charts (Table 75). ${ }^{4,5}$ Although intrauterine growth serves as the model for preterm infants, the currently available cross-sectional references are limited, and ultimately the pattern of growth over time provides the best indication of nutrition status and growth outcomes.

Growth monitoring and assessment in the first 1-2 weeks should focus on the degree of weight loss compared with birth weight and regaining birth weight by at least day of life 14 in the setting of stable or euvolemic fluid status and adequate nutrition intake. ${ }^{6,7}$ After the first 2 weeks, weight gain velocity is assessed over 5 - to 7 -day periods. ${ }^{8,9}$ Length and head circumference should be measured weekly and assessed on the growth chart after the first $2-3$ weeks.

The current goal for neonates and preterm infants is to maintain the growth trajectory within approximately 1 SD of the birth weight $z$ score; however, there is some debate about whether birth weight or a postdiuresis weight should be used, given the expected physiologic weight loss that occurs as the extracellular water (ECW) contracts in postnatal diuresis. ${ }^{11}$ In current practice, the focus should be on following the pattern of growth, ideally parallel to the growth chart curves, while also monitoring weight growth velocities and $z$ score changes over time. ${ }^{12}$

# Energy and Protein Needs 

Term infants require energy and protein intakes to support optimal health, development, and a normal growth trajectory. Preterm infants require increased energy and protein intakes to account for the lack of nutrient stores at birth and accumulated nutrition deficits and to support gradual catch-up growth. Energy and protein intake needs for preterm infants are determined based on the physiologic requirements to achieve an adequate rate and composition of growth and weight gain compared with a fetus of similar size and GA. ${ }^{13}$

## Energy Needs

Total energy needs are determined by considering the basal energy requirements, energy cost of growth, energy requirements of physical activity and stress, and thermic effect of food and the energy need for temperature regulation. ${ }^{13,14}$ The goal is to provide adequate early energy intake to prevent breakdown of the limited energy stores a neonate may have, while also accounting for energy that is needed for growth. Energy needs can vary significantly over the first days and weeks and should be assessed regularly. A variety of factors may influence the energy expenditure of a hospitalized term or preterm infant ${ }^{14}$ :

- Physical activity
- Dietary intake
- Environmental interactions
- Clinical conditions
- Medications

Measurement of energy expenditure by using indirect calorimetry in neonates, although possible, is not widely used because of a lack of available expertise and equipment at most centers as well as technical limitations such as complex clinical status and mechanical ventilation modalities. It is especially challenging for preterm infants because of size, feeding schedules, and respiratory support modalities, and it is not typically used outside of the research setting. ${ }^{15,16}$ Predictive equations are not generally used in neonates, as they have not been shown to correctly predict energy expenditure in infants. ${ }^{16}$ Growth remains the gold standard for the assessment of energy requirements.

Parenterally fed infants typically require less energy than enterally fed infants, as the energy cost of digestion and absorption is lower with intravenous nutrient delivery, and there are reduced fecal energy losses. ${ }^{14}$ An additional $30 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ is required for enterally fed neonates to account for these differences. ${ }^{13}$ Parenteral and enteral energy requirements for term and preterm infants are listed in Tables 7-7 and 7-8. Some infants will require energy intakes greater than the amounts listed to achieve adequate growth.

# Protein Needs 

Human milk serves as the model for determining protein needs for neonates and informs the recommended intakes for full-term infants, which are estimated at about $1.5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$, but the exact requirements are not defined, given the variability of human milk composition over the course of lactation. ${ }^{17}$ Preterm and low birth weight (LBW) infants require higher protein intake to account for the increased growth rates while also considering catch-up growth. Protein requirements are estimated from fetal accretion rates and the intake required to achieve a rate of growth and body composition of a fetus of similar GA. ${ }^{18}$ The optimal protein dose and composition for PN and EN are listed in Tables 7-7 and $7-8 .{ }^{19}$ Human milk with added human milk fortifiers and preterm infant formulas will meet protein intake goals when infants are fed at least $120 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$. Full-term infants receiving an exclusively human milk diet require approximately $1.5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ of protein, and full-term formula-fed infants require between 2 and $2.5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ of protein.

## Vitamin and Micronutrients

## Micronutrient Requirements

Clinical conditions will affect absorption of micronutrients. For example, absorption of calcium and phosphorus is influenced by postnatal age and intake of vitamin D, lactose, and fat. In preterm infants,

--- page 218 ---

however, vitamin D may contribute little to calcium absorption. ${ }^{20}$ Similarly, vitamins are supplied to the fetus via maternal transfer. Water-soluble vitamins are actively transported across the placenta throughout pregnancy, whereas the fat-soluble vitamins $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{D}$ and E are transferred during the last trimester of pregnancy. There is negligible transfer of vitamin $\mathrm{K} .^{21}$

# Fluid Needs 

Fluid requirements for the neonate should be based on weight and clinical condition. In the first few days of life, fluid intake should be individualized based on ongoing changes in weight, urine output, and sodium status. At birth, fluid intake is approximately $70-80 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ and gradually increases to 150 $\mathrm{mL} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ by the end of the first week of life. ${ }^{22}$ Requirements are inversely related to GA, reaching as high as $100 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ on the first day of life in the extremely LBW (ELBW) infant. ${ }^{23}$ At birth, there is a physiologic loss of sodium because of the normal contraction of extracellular volume. In comparison with term infants, preterm infants have higher total body water and ECW per kilogram. The extent of contraction of the ECW compartment is greater in small-for-GA infants than in appropriate-for-GA infants. During the first week of life, term infants exhibit a $5 \%-7 \%$ weight loss, whereas preterm infants may exhibit a $10 \%-15 \%$ weight loss. ${ }^{24}$ Depending on other clinical characteristics, fluid requirements may reach as high as $200 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$. Achieving the right balance is key, as excessive fluids could potentially increase the risk of patent ductus arteriosus and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). ${ }^{25}$

## Neonatal Parenteral Nutrition

## Indications

Because of their low nutrient reserves at birth, many preterm and LBW infants require parenteral nutrition (PN) until they are able sustain themselves enterally. The immaturity of their intestinal tract and the paucity of digestive enzymes makes it difficult for the preterm infant to digest nutrients enterally.

## Venous Access

The type of vascular access and the location of the catheter will dictate the type of PN formulation that can be safely infused. The location of the catheter tip in the central venous circulation is crucial for the infusion of hypertonic PN solutions. ${ }^{26}$ Central location reduces the risk of thrombus and vascular intimal damage. A central catheter tip location allows for instantaneous dilution of hypertonic PN solution ( $>900 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$ ) into the blood stream. In children, the superior vena cava (SVC), the junction of the SVC and the right atrium, the brachiocephalic/SVC junction, and the inferior vena cava above the bifurcation of the iliac veins all are considered central locations for the catheter tip placement and offer the largest-caliber lumen and high blood flows. ${ }^{26}$ Documentation of catheter tip location by radiographic confirmation is required for PN administration because malpositioned catheters can have serious and even fatal consequences.

Peripheral vascular access may be used to infuse PN, but the final osmolarity must be less than 900 $\mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$ to decrease the risk of phlebitis. ${ }^{27}$ This limits the amount of protein, dextrose, and electrolytes that can be delivered. Patients receiving PN via the peripheral route must be able to tolerate higher volumes of fluid to meet their nutrition goals because a more dilute PN must be used. Table 7-9 lists the osmolarity of commonly use PN fluids. The following equation shows one method of determining PN osmolarity:

Abbreviation: PN, parenteral nutrition.

# Fluid Requirements 

Typically, maintenance fluid is provided with the PN solution. Maintenance fluid requirements can be assessed by using the Holliday-Segar method (see Table 4-5 in chapter 4, "Infant to Adolescent"). ${ }^{28}$ Fluid requirements can be higher when there are increased insensible losses (fever or tachypnea) or sensible losses (diarrhea, nasogastric [NG] output, ostomy losses, polyuria, or vomiting). In certain clinical situations, such as cardiac, hepatic, or renal dysfunction, fluids may need to be restricted. Fluid needs will vary with a variety of clinical and environmental conditions (Table 7-10). Therefore, routine clinical monitoring of hydration status, including electrolytes and intakes and outputs, is essential for neonates receiving PN. Table 7-11 lists the estimated electrolyte losses and typical replacement fluids used in various GI losses; however, precise quantification is possible by sending a specimen to the chemistry laboratory for measurement of electrolyte concentrations.

${ }^{\text {b }}$ Any replacement solution with potassium needs to be infused over several hours depending on the total amount of potassium and total volume of replacement fluid required.

In the parenterally fed patient, if the patient's fluid requirements are being met but their energy needs are not, it is generally recommended to increase the volume of PN administered rather than to increase the concentration of nutrients in the PN. This reduces the need to infuse hypertonic solutions, which are more damaging to the intima of blood vessels. ${ }^{29}$ This approach assumes that the patient's cardiovascular and renal systems can tolerate the increased volume of parenteral fluids.

# Components of PN 

In neonatal PN solutions, dextrose, amino acids, electrolytes, and micronutrients are typically provided in a single solution. Because of stability limitations, lipid injectable emulsions (ILEs) are usually infused separately from the dextrose-protein solution. In circumstances in which severe fluid restriction is necessary, the fluid from the fat emulsion is considered in the total fluid allotment. ${ }^{29}$ In most cases, however, fluid provision from fat emulsion is calculated in addition to the PN volume.

## Macronutrients

To achieve optimal growth, neonatal PN contains protein calories (as crystalline amino acids) and nonprotein calories as carbohydrates (as dextrose) and fat (in the form of an ILE). Table 7-12 describes the energy density of these components. Table 7-13 summarizes current recommendations for macronutrient initiation and advancement in the parenterally fed neonate.

Abbreviation: PN, parenteral nutrition.
${ }^{a}$ A normal nonprotein energy (kilocalories)/nitrogen (grams) ratio is between 150:1 and 250:1. The ratio is calculated as follows: nonprotein energy (kilocalories)/nitrogen (grams) ratio = (carbohydrate calories + fat calories)/(protein intake in grams/6.25).
${ }^{\text {b }}$ To convert from \% dextrose to $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{min}$, use the following formula: \% dextrose $\times(1 \mathrm{dL} / 100 \mathrm{~mL}) \times(1000 \mathrm{mg} / 1 \mathrm{~g}) \times$ (hourly infusion rate in $\mathrm{mL} / \mathrm{h}) \times(1 \mathrm{~h} / 60 \mathrm{~min}) \times(1 /$ weight in kg$)$. For example, $10 \%$ dextrose infusing at $10 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{h}$ in a 3 kg infant is calculated as follows: $10 \times(1 / 100 \mathrm{~mL}) \times(1000 \mathrm{mg} / 1 \mathrm{~g}) \times(10 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{h}) \times(1 \mathrm{~h} / 60 \mathrm{~min}) \times(1 / 3 \mathrm{~kg})=5.6 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{min}$ ${ }^{\text {c }}$ Additional calories are provided by phospholipid emulsifiers and glycerol.

# Protein 

Because of hepatic immaturity and different requirements, special crystalline amino acid formulations have been developed (Table 7-14). In comparison with traditional amino acid products, these products are designed to mimic the plasma amino acid profiles of the healthy breastfed infant. Pediatric amino acid formulations contain less methionine, phenylalanine, and glycine and are supplemented with the semi-essential amino acids taurine, glutamic acid, and aspartic acid. Because of stability limitations, cysteine is added at the time of compounding. In addition to improving nitrogen balance and normalizing the plasma amino acid profile in the neonate, cysteine decreases the pH of the PN, thus improving calcium and phosphorus solubility. Given that it is a chloride salt, cysteine may also predispose the neonate to metabolic acidosis.

Traditional doses of cysteine range from 20 to 40 mg per gram of amino acids. In times of shortage, to conserve supplies, cysteine should be reserved for neonates weighing less than 1 kg , in whom cysteine has been shown to improve nitrogen balance. Specially formulated amino acid blends may be extemporaneously compounded from individual amino acids for infants with inborn errors of metabolism (eg, maple syrup urine disease).

To prevent additional losses, protein is dosed as high as $4 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ in preterm neonates receiving "starter PN." For term neonates, dosing begins as $2-3 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ with a goal dose of $2.5-3 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ (Table 713). Although some centers may advance protein provision more slowly (ie, $0.5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ ), there is no evidence to support that practice. Protein doses of $1 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ have been shown to prevent negative nitrogen balance and minimize the risk of hyperkalemia. ${ }^{30}$ To prevent catabolism and additional protein losses, it is important that protein be provided in addition to dextrose soon after birth. Infants only provided dextrose-containing fluids would continue to break down muscle mass that is difficult to regain.

# Carbohydrates

--- page 223 ---

Anhydrous dextrose is the form of carbohydrate used in PN. To meet the neonate's obligatory needs, it is initiated at a minimum glucose infusion rate (GIR) of $5-8 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{min}$. Depending on tolerance, dextrose is gradually advanced to a GIR of $12-15 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{min}$. Use of insulin is avoided, and ILE provision can be altered to offset the loss of carbohydrate calories in glucose-intolerant neonates. Table 7-13 provides dextrose advancement guidelines.

# Fat 

In the parenterally fed neonate, fat is provided as an ILE. These are isotonic emulsions containing an oil source, glycerin, and an egg yolk phospholipid emulsifying agent. In addition to providing an alternative to dextrose as a nonprotein calorie source, these products provide essential fatty acids (EFAs). Similar to human milk, about $40 \%-50 \%$ of total PN calories are provided as fat. At doses of 2$3 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$, fat can improve protein retention. ${ }^{31}$

There are currently 3 ILE formulations approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for pediatric use (see chapter 6, "Parenteral Nutrition," Table 6-6). A pure soy oil ILE may theoretically increase the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). ${ }^{31}$ Recently approved products have reduced amounts of the proinflammatory fatty acids and higher amounts of omega- 3 fatty acids that may also be less hepatotoxic.

Because of differences in oil composition, different dosing strategies for ILE products must be used to prevent EFA deficiency (EFAD) (see chapter 6, "Parenteral Nutrition," Table 6-6). Preterm infants lose out on maternal transfer of the EFAs docosahexaenoic acid and arachidonic acid, and, moreover, because of hepatic immaturity, are inefficient at synthesizing these EFAs from their respective precursors $\alpha$-linolenic acid and linolenic acid. Using products that contain these preformed EFAs may be beneficial in this population, but evidence is still lacking.

Serum triglyceride (TG) levels should be monitored for ILE tolerance. The goal is to have serum TG levels less than $250 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$. Infants prone to hypertriglyceridemia should have their lipids infused over 24 hours at an ILE infusion rate not to exceed $0.15-0.17 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{h}$ (depending on ILE product). ${ }^{31}$ Because of low amounts of lipoprotein lipase in their capillary epithelium that facilitates TG metabolism, infants may benefit from the addition of heparin to the PN at $0.5-1 \mathrm{U} / \mathrm{mL}$ of PN to induce the enzyme and improve clearance. ${ }^{32}$ The addition of the lysine derivative levocarnitine has also been shown to help manage hypertriglyceridemia by transporting long-chain TGs across the cell membrane into the mitochondria. ${ }^{33}$

## Micronutrients

Preterm infants are born deficient in many micronutrients. Most maternal transfer of these vitamins, minerals, and electrolytes occurs in the third trimester of growth. The more premature the neonate, the greater the requirements. Table 7-15 summarizes the ASPEN-recommended PN electrolyte and mineral daily doses.

# Sodium 

Because of the normal contraction of extracellular volume in the first days of life, there is a loss of sodium. Because of their inability to conserve sodium, the amount of sodium the preterm infant requires is greater than that of the term neonate. Sodium is an important growth factor. Failure to provide adequate sodium can result in a growth failure. ${ }^{34}$ Monitoring urine sodium is preferred, although its utility is limited in infants receiving diuretics. Although not perfect, measurement of the urine sodium concentration allows assessment of total body sodium stores. ${ }^{35}$ Current best practice suggests that in patients with normal and mature renal function, urine sodium higher than $30 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ is reflective of a positive sodium balance, measurements less than $30 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ represent total body sodium depletion, and measurements less than $10 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ indicate a severe deficit.

## Potassium

Potassium is the major intracellular cation responsible for muscle contractility and cardiac function. It is influenced by acid-base status. Acidosis causes potassium to move from cells to extracellular fluid in exchange for hydrogen ions, whereas alkalosis causes the reverse movement of potassium and hydrogen ions. ${ }^{36}$ Preterm infants tend to have higher serum potassium levels at birth, but it gradually decreases. Supplementation at $1-2 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ should be done once adequate urine output is established. ${ }^{37}$

## Calcium and Phosphorus

To avoid hypophosphatemia and optimize bone mineralization, high intakes of both calcium and phosphorus are necessary. In clinically stable, growing preterm infants, calcium intake of $65-100 \mathrm{mg}$ of elemental calcium and $60-80 \mathrm{mg}$ of phosphorus is recommended. In addition to optimizing intake, the proper ratio of calcium and phosphorus in also required to promote bone mineralization. ASPEN recommends a ratio of 1.3:1 (molar ratio) or 1.7:1 (mass ratio) of calcium to phosphorus. Others have suggested ratios of $1.7: 1(\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{mg})$ or as low as $1.1: 1(\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{mg}) .{ }^{38}$ Failure to provide the proper intake of calcium and phosphorus at the proper ratios can result in electrolyte derangements. If amino acids are provided without sufficient phosphorus, hypophosphatemia and hypercalcemia can result. Likewise,

--- page 225 ---

hypercalcemia can occur if inadequate phosphorus is provided or high calcium/phosphorus ratios are used. Provision of calcium without phosphorus or phosphorus without calcium should be avoided, as proper bone mineralization requires provision of both.

Monitoring of the calcium and phosphorus status takes additional factors into consideration. In patients with hypoalbuminemia, serum calcium levels must be adjusted, or an ionized serum calcium should be obtained, recognizing that acidosis can increase ionized calcium. To properly interpret whether intake is adequate, a serum phosphorus level should be obtained at the same time. Age-based normal ranges should be used because errors in interpretation can occur when the wrong age range is applied while assessing phosphorus status. ${ }^{39}$ In patients with hypomagnesemia, the magnesium status should be corrected prior to correcting calcium stores, as the 2 are interrelated. Similarly, significant hyperphosphatemia should be corrected prior to correcting hypocalcemia to minimize the risk of softtissue calcification if $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right] \times\left[\mathrm{PO}_{4}{ }^{3-}\right]>70 .{ }^{40}$

One of the challenges in providing adequate calcium and phosphorus in the parenterally fed neonate is avoiding precipitation in the PN solution. Calcium-phosphate crystals can form, which can result in pulmonary thromboembolism. There are multiple factors that increase the risk of precipitation (Table 716). Given the risk and the wide variability of predisposing factors to precipitation, it is imperative that all PN is infused through a $1.2-\mu \mathrm{m}$ inline filter $(0.2 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ may be used if there are no ILEs being infused through the same catheter). ${ }^{41}$

TABLE 7-16. Factors That Influence Calcium Phosphorus Precipitation

| Factor | Minimizes Risk of Precipitation | Increases Risk of Precipitation |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| pH | pH 4.5-7; addition of cysteine | $\mathrm{pH}>7$ |
| Calcium salt | Calcium gluconate | Calcium chloride |
| Temperature | Room temperature (ie, $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ) | $>25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$; avoid excessive warming of <br> the solution |

# Magnesium 

Magnesium, like calcium, is influenced by albumin status and the following formula can be used to correct serum magnesium levels in the presence of hypoalbuminemia. ${ }^{42}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& {[\text { Dextrose } \mathrm{g} / \mathrm{L} \times 5]+[\text { amino acid } \mathrm{g} / \mathrm{L} \times 10]+[\text { (sodium }+ \text { potassium }+} \\
& \text { calcium }+ \text { magnesium } \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}) \times 2]=\text { approximate } \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L} \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}
\end{aligned}
$$

--- page 226 ---

Ionized magnesium levels are available but less frequently used. Typically, magnesium can be provided upon initiation of PN in the neonate. The exception is the neonate born to the mother who has received magnesium to treat preeclampsia during delivery. Magnesium concentrations tend to be elevated in these infants prior to starting PN, and provision in the PN should be held until they are normalized.

# Anion Balance 

Patients developing acidosis while receiving PN may benefit from the addition of base to the solution in the form of sodium or potassium acetate salts. Bicarbonate should never be added to the PN, as it may result in precipitation of calcium and phosphate. ${ }^{43}$ Chloride-free PNs should be avoided, as they may predispose patients to metabolic alkalosis. ${ }^{44}$

## Levocarnitine

The ability of preterm infants to oxidize fatty acids is related to their limited carnitine stores. Carnitine is necessary in long-chain fatty acid transport into the mitochondrial matrix for $\beta$-oxidation. ${ }^{45}$ Carnitine is obtained from the diet or synthesized endogenously from the amino acids lysine and methionine. Neonates weighing less than 5 kg are generally carnitine deficient and will require that carnitine in the form of levocarnitine be added to their PN at an initial dose of $2-5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d} .{ }^{46}$ Higher doses up to $10-$ $20 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ may be necessary in patients who have elevated TG levels or are receiving PN for longer than 7 days. Both free and total plasma carnitine concentrations should be monitored. To evaluate for carnitine deficiency, the plasma acylcarnitine/free carnitine (A/F) ratio should be used ${ }^{47}$ :

A/F ratio $=($ plasma total carnitine - free carnitine $) /($ free carnitine $)$

A normal plasma A/F ratio is 0.25 ; carnitine deficiency is associated with an $\mathrm{A} / \mathrm{F}$ ratio greater than 0.4 .

## Trace Elements

Maternal transfer of approximately two-thirds of zinc, copper, and iron to the fetus occurs during the last $10-12$ weeks of gestation. ${ }^{48}$ Infants born at $28-30$ weeks of gestation, weighing less than 1 kg are born with limited stores. Trace elements commonly added to PN solutions include zinc, copper, selenium, manganese, and chromium. For term infants requiring short (ie, $<2$ weeks) courses of PN, it may not be necessary to provide them, but they should be provided to preterm neonates upon PN initiation. In particular, zinc and copper are necessary for growth, and serious complications have been reported when they have not been provided. Table 7-17 provides the typical doses of the most commonly supplemented trace elements. Because of biliary excretion of copper and manganese, these trace elements should be reduced in patients with cholestasis. Similarly, parenteral intake of selenium and chromium should be reduced or held in cases of renal dysfunction. If a multi-ingredient trace element mixture is used, practitioners should take the amount provided by the product into consideration when determining the added amount to supplement (Table 7-18).

# Zinc 

Zinc is an essential trace element necessary for metabolism of energy and growth. Neonates receiving zinc-free PN for prolonged periods are at risk for growth retardation, infections, and a distinctive rash (ie, acrodermatitis enteropathica). Some infants will require higher intakes of zinc. Infants with short bowel syndrome or excessive diarrhea from other causes may require significantly higher amounts of zinc. For such neonates, it is common practice to add additional zinc to help replace those losses. ${ }^{49}$ Assessment of zinc status by monitoring serum zinc concentrations is inaccurate, as it does not reflect total body stores of zinc. A better way to assess zinc status is by monitoring alkaline phosphatase concentrations. In states of zinc deficiency, serum alkaline phosphatase levels will also be depressed. ${ }^{50}$

## Copper

--- page 228 ---

Like zinc, copper is also important to infant growth. It is also important for bone health, as copper deficiency can affect the epiphyses of the bone and cupping can occur. Because of biliary excretion of copper, it should be reduced in patients with cholestasis. Copper should not be eliminated totally without monitoring levels periodically, as individuals on long-term PN with intestinal failure-associated liver disease (IFALD) can develop hypocupremia. This can result in anemia, thrombocytopenia, osteopenia, and neutropenia. ${ }^{51}$ Cases of microcytic hypochromic anemia unresponsive to iron supplementation are suggestive of copper deficiency. As the serum level of copper is influenced by that of ceruloplasmin, both should be considered when interpreting copper levels. The following formula can be used to more accurately assess copper status ${ }^{52}$ :

$$
\begin{gathered}
\text { Adjusted copper in } \mu \mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{L}=(\text { total copper in } \mu \mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{L})+ \\
(0.052 \times \text { ceruloplasmin in } \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L})+(17.5 \mu \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L})
\end{gathered}
$$

# Selenium 

The addition of selenium may be necessary after 30 days of PN and no or minimal enteral intake. Neonates with intestinal failure may have greater selenium losses due to diarrhea or ostomy losses. In infants, selenium deficiency is associated with growth retardation and alopecia with pseudoalbinism, which are reversible with adequate supplementation. ${ }^{53}$ Selenium intake should be reduced in cases of renal dysfunction.

## Chromium

Early hyperglycemia is prevalent in preterm infants receiving PN therapy. Chromium improves glucose tolerance by potentiating the action of insulin. Although important in glucose tolerance, newer trace element mixtures do not contain it (Table 7-18). PN chromium supplementation has been shown to improve glucose tolerance and calorie delivery during the first week of life, especially in very LBW (VLBW) infants. ${ }^{54}$

## Manganese

Manganese is a component of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase, which helps fight free radicals. There may be sufficient manganese contamination that routine supplementation may not be necessary. ${ }^{55}$ Manganese neurotoxicity is a concern in neonates receiving PN. ${ }^{56}$ If manganese toxicity is suspected, manganese should be removed from the PN and erythrocyte manganese levels and a 24 -hour urine manganese level should be obtained. ${ }^{57}$ There are reports of abnormal cranial magnetic resonance imaging findings consistent with manganese deposition, a concern for neonates receiving long-term PN who may be at risk of neurocognitive dysfunction due to prematurity and other preexisting medical problems. ${ }^{58}$ If IFALD is present, manganese is usually removed or dose reduced from PN. ${ }^{58}$

## Vitamins

The importance of vitamins in neonates receiving PN has been underscored in the United States by several widespread shortages of parenteral multivitamins and reports of symptomatic thiamine deficiency. ${ }^{59}$ Vitamin deficiencies have been reported in patients receiving vitamin-free PN in as little as a few weeks. Table 7-19 describes the current pediatric parenteral vitamin products available in the United States.

${ }^{\mathrm{b}}$ Infuvite (Baxter).

In comparison with the products intended for patients older than age 11, the pediatric versions of multivitamins are notable for higher amounts of vitamins K and D and lower amounts of the B vitamins. Certain patient conditions may require adjustments to their parenteral vitamin intake. For example, patients with high GI fistula output may require a double dose of multivitamins because of increased losses. ${ }^{60}$ Patients with prolonged prothrombin times may benefit from short courses of supplemental vitamin K.

In the event of a parenteral multivitamin shortage, it is imperative that practitioners provide adequate thiamine with dextrose infusions to avoid metabolic lactic acidosis. Adult parenteral multivitamins should never be used in the neonate because of the propylene glycol and polysorbates contained in many of these products that could be toxic to a neonate. ${ }^{61}$ Adult multivitamin products contain less vitamin D and K and may increase the risk of metabolic bone disease in neonates on long-term PN therapy. Neonates who must receive PN without conventional pediatric parenteral multivitamins should always receive parenteral thiamine in the PN at a dose of $0.03 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d} .{ }^{62}$ There is currently no parenteral vitamin preparation designed especially for preterm infants, and there is some controversy concerning vitamin requirements for these patients. ${ }^{62}$ Table 7-20 describes the recommended levels of intake for parenteral multivitamins for term and preterm infants.

# Other Additives 

## Heparin

Heparin is often added to neonatal PN, especially those infusing via a central venous catheter (CVC). Limited evidence suggests that the addition of heparin to neonatal PN may reduce the incidence of CVC occlusion. ${ }^{63}$ When used as a PN additive to maintain catheter patency doses of $0.5-1 \mathrm{U} / \mathrm{mL}$ (final heparin concentration in the PN solution) have been used. ${ }^{46}$ The final concentration of heparin used for PN solutions may need to be reduced in smaller neonates receiving large PN volumes to avoid approaching therapeutic doses.

## Insulin

Because the risk of hypoglycemia outweighs the potential benefits of insulin on growth, the addition of insulin to PN is not recommended. ${ }^{64}$

## Special Situations

## Starter PN

Evidence has demonstrated that early PN administration in preterm LBW neonates can improve growth and potentially neurodevelopment. Within hours of delivery, a solution of protein (as amino acids, fat [in the form of ILE], and carbohydrates [as dextrose]) is administered until a customized PN can be compounded. Also, referred to as "vanilla bags" or "day of life 1 PN ," these solutions are started soon

--- page 231 ---

after birth and are intended to prevent the catabolic processes that can result in additional muscle mass loss. These solutions provide sufficient energy and protein and sufficient calcium to prevent hypocalcemia. Typical starter PNs contain dextrose, amino acids, and calcium but are free of sodium, potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus. Some programs also provide ILE as part of the starter PN provision. ${ }^{65}$

Term neonates should also be provided PN if they are unable to receive enteral feedings for more than 2-3 days. The glycogen and fat stores are rapidly depleted, and the neonate will become catabolic and break down their protein stores for energy. Neonates with severe respiratory failure, congenital heart defects, or NEC often receive PN initially. ${ }^{66}$

# Compounding PN for the Neonate 

In addition to the calcium and phosphorus compatibility issues, other compounding factors have been the focus of recent attention in hopes of preventing PN-related complications in the neonate. These include minimizing aluminum exposure, protecting the solutions from light, and avoidance of di(2ethylhexyl)phthalate-containing materials. Preterm infants and children with intestinal failure have immature or diminished antioxidant defenses that render them more susceptible to oxidant stress that can influence the selection of many PN additives.

Practitioners responsible for overseeing the compounding of PN solutions for neonates must be familiar with the differences in additive formulations and the impact that any potential product substitution may pose to this fragile population. In times of shortages, a proactive approach to conserve and prioritize supplies for neonates requiring PN and being aware of expert opinions and guidelines as the drug shortages crisis continues are necessary.

## Ambient Light

When PN is exposed to ambient light, hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxides are generated. ${ }^{67}$ There is an approximate $50 \%$ reduction in the amount of hydrogen peroxide generated when the entire PN solution and delivery system is protected from ambient light (ie, amino acid dextrose bag, lipid syringe, and tubing). ${ }^{68,69}$ This interaction was first reported in the early 1980s when it was observed that light exposure might cause vitamin instability, but most practitioners still choose not to cover solutions, especially if the multivitamins are added immediately prior to infusing. Multivitamins, however, are not the only component of PN that may be impacted by light. The amino acids tryptophan and tyrosine undergo photo-oxidation to form free radicals with hepatotoxic properties. ${ }^{70}$ Other amino acids such as cysteine, histidine, and methionine are also prone to photo-oxidation. By serving as a photosensitizing agent, riboflavin appears to facilitate the photo-oxidation process. ${ }^{68}$ Lipid emulsions are also negatively impacted by exposure to ambient light. Phototherapy might cause significant peroxidation to ILE, resulting in the formation of cytotoxic TG hydroperoxides. ${ }^{71}$ Lipid hydroperoxides have been linked with pulmonary vasoconstriction via an interference with endogenous prostaglandin synthesis. ${ }^{72}$ Recently, ASPEN issued recommendations for the use of photoprotection of PN and ILE but recognized that the limitations to the ability of available products to ensure complete photoprotection are still a major obstacle for implementation. ${ }^{73}$

## Di(2-Ethylhexyl)Phthalate Toxicity

$\mathrm{Di}(2$-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) is an industrial additive plasticizer found in polyvinylchloride (PVC). PN administration sets and containers have been shown to be the most important source of DEHP load. Although DEHP has a rapid turnover (half-life less than 24 hours), this phthalate and its

--- page 232 ---

metabolites are consistently detected in human bodily fluids such as plasma and urine. ${ }^{74}$ In critically ill neonates, DEHP exposure has been shown to increase oxidative stress and toxicity. ${ }^{75} \mathrm{PN}$ infusion sets and containers containing DEHP have been implicated as contributing to this risk. One retrospective study suggests that by changing to PVC-free infusion systems, the incidence of PN cholestasis could be reduced. ${ }^{75}$

# Aluminum Contamination 

Aluminum exposure is a risk in patients receiving prolonged courses of receiving PN. This nonessential trace element is found in raw materials, incorporated into products during the manufacturing process, and leached from glass containers. ${ }^{76}$ When aluminum is delivered parenterally, it bypasses the protective barrier of the GI tract. Specific findings of this toxicity include encephalopathy, impaired neurodevelopment, bone pain with development of osteopenia or osteomalacia, microcytic anemia, and cholestasis. In 2004, the FDA issued a mandate that required manufacturers to include the aluminum content on the label of additives commonly used in the compounding of PN solutions. ${ }^{77}$ The amount of aluminum provided by PN should be less than $5 \mu \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$, the threshold deemed "safe" by the FDA.

Calcium gluconate salts are a major source of aluminum contamination in PN patients. Because calcium gluconate salts are a large source of contamination, infants and children are at risk of developing toxicity because of their high calcium requirements coupled with renal immaturity. In response to the findings of potential adverse neurodevelopment associated with aluminum exposure, the use of calcium chloride in PN solutions has been reevaluated. ${ }^{78}$ Calcium chloride salts are inherently less contaminated and in theory could be used as an alternative to calcium gluconate salts. Calcium/phosphorus solubility is a major a concern, as calcium chloride salts have a higher degree of dissociation and a greater risk of precipitation. ${ }^{79}$ This risk can be minimized if calcium chloride salts are used with an organic phosphate salt; however, these organic phosphate salts are expensive and not available in many countries.

The implementation of the FDA mandate has been difficult to incorporate into clinical practice because of limitations in current product formulations. Currently, there are few options available to reduce the aluminum load in PN solutions. One is to replace potassium phosphate with sodium phosphate salts that have considerably less aluminum. Moreover, not all ingredients (ie, heparin, albumin, insulin) added to PN solutions have a requirement for aluminum to be listed on their label, which makes it even more difficult to accurately calculate potential aluminum exposure secondary to PN use. ${ }^{80}$

## Monitoring

Monitoring the neonate's biochemical and clinical response to the initiation and continuation of PN is an essential part of patient treatment. One especially important parameter with which to assess the effectiveness of PN is weight gain. In neonates, weight and length gain along standard reference curves should be the goal for nutrition therapy, including PN. Serial measurements of head circumference and arm anthropometrics are also worthwhile to monitor. Biochemical monitoring helps to ensure tolerance to specific components of PN and may prevent many of the complications associated with this high-risk therapy. Recommended monitoring parameters are provided in Table 7-21, and Table 7-22 lists the metabolic conditions that are common among patients receiving PN, along with suggested therapeutic interventions.

# Weaning/Discontinuing PN 

When the patient is tolerating more than $50 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ of feedings, PN should be gradually tapered off. PN may be discontinued when the infant is tolerating $100-120 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg}$ or more of enteral feedings or is receiving $25 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ or less of PN . Taper the dextrose infusion rate to prevent rebound hypoglycemia. In comparison with older children, neonates require slower tapering with continued monitoring of blood glucose even after the PN is discontinued. ILEs may be stopped without tapering.

## Enteral Nutrition

## Human Milk

Human milk is the preferred feeding choice for all infants, especially those who are hospitalized and/or born prematurely. The short- and long-term benefits of a human milk diet for all infants are great, but increasing evidence points to the clinical benefits of human milk for hospitalized infants, sick term infants, and especially preterm VLBW infants. These benefits include lower incidences of NEC, lateonset sepsis, chronic lung disease, ROP, and neurodevelopmental impairment. ${ }^{81,82}$ Human milk is available as "mother's own milk" (MOM), expressed from the infant's mother, or as "donor human milk" (DHM). DHM is donated, pooled, pasteurized human milk. It is important that DHM is obtained from a DHM bank to ensure appropriate screening of donors and safe handling, processing, and pasteurization of the milk. Donor milk is the recommended feeding option for VLBW infants if the maternal milk supply is inadequate or not available. ${ }^{83}$ Infants receiving DHM either as a supplement to MOM or as full feedings should be monitored closely for poor growth due to lower nutrient content, including of protein, zinc, and sodium. ${ }^{84}$ DHM is typically provided to VLBW infants with insufficient MOM until approximately $32-36$ weeks' GA, when the risk of NEC is lower before transition to a preterm infant formula. ${ }^{83}$ Challenges with achieving adequate growth and limited availability outside of the hospital should be considered if DHM is provided beyond this period.

--- page 240 ---

Human milk is a biological fluid, and contamination is a risk that must be mitigated by establishing protocols and providing education to parents and health care providers about safe practices for pumping, storing, handling, and transporting MOM and DHM. ${ }^{83}$ In addition to infectious contaminants, maternal health conditions and medications should be evaluated. Donors to human milk banks are carefully screened for health and infectious risk factors before the milk is pasteurized, which has been shown to be highly effective at removing contaminants. Specific safety protocols should also be in place for the appropriate handling, storage, transportation, and administration of DHM. ${ }^{13,83}$ The following resources help health care providers and facilities develop usage guidelines and safety protocols to meet their needs:

# Human Milk Fortification 

Although human milk is the ideal source of nutrition for neonates and infants, it does not meet the nutrition needs of most growing preterm infants. ${ }^{13}$ Term infants with medical or surgical conditions that increase energy requirements or impact feeding and growth may require additional calories to be added to breast milk in the form of infant formula if they are unable to take a volume of human milk to meet the demand for adequate growth. ${ }^{89}$

For preterm infants, multiple commercially sterile, multinutrient, concentrated liquid human milk fortifier (HMF) products are available, and when they are added to human milk fed at recommended volumes, they are designed to meet the nutrition needs of these infants for adequate growth, mineral accretion, and neurodevelopment. ${ }^{13,84}$ Historically, human milk fortification involves the addition of a specific amount of fortifier to a volume of human milk, referred to as standard fortification. Because of the variable nature of human milk and ongoing struggles with optimizing growth in preterm infants, targeted and adjustable fortification strategies are being used. These consist of either adding additional protein based on serum urea nitrogen levels (adjustable) or adjusting fortification based on human milk nutrient analysis (target). ${ }^{90}$

There are 2 categories of HMFs for preterm infants: bovine or cow's milk-based fortifiers and human milk-based fortifiers that are derived from donated human milk (Table 7-23). Preterm infants born weighing less than 1800 g should be fed fortified human milk by using commercially available multinutrient fortifier at volumes between 150 and $180 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ to meet their nutrition needs for growth. ${ }^{91-93}$ HMF products are often used in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) for all preterm infants born at less than 34 weeks to optimize nutrition intake before transition to discharge feedings shortly before discharge, as preterm fortifier products are not commercially available outside of the hospital setting. ${ }^{94}$

Donor milk provided to preterm infants should be fortified with a multinutrient HMF product and may require increased fortification compared with MOM. ${ }^{81,83}$ Historically, fortification was often delayed until volumes of $100 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ or even full feedings because of fear of feeding intolerance and NEC, but there is a lack of high-quality evidence to support or refute this practice. ${ }^{95-97}$ Earlier fortification can improve nutrient delivery during the transition from PN, which has been associated with improved growth outcomes. ${ }^{98}$

The precise feeding volume for early fortification will depend on the type of fortifier used. Cow's milk-based fortifier products should be initiated at $60-80 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ feeding volume and may be used for preterm infants until a weight of 3.6 kg at standard feeding volumes $(150-160 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}) .{ }^{93,94}$ Above this volume, infants will need close monitoring because of the potential for excessive protein, mineral, and fat-soluble vitamin intakes. For the human milk-based fortifier, it is recommended to initiate at or

--- page 242 ---

before a feeding volume of $60 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ and continue until 34 weeks. ${ }^{99}$ Most of these infants will still require fortification with cow's milk-based HMF or preterm formula to ensure adequate growth.

# Neonatal Infant Formulas 

If human milk, either MOM or DHM, is unavailable for the neonate, a broad range and selection of infant formulas are available. Standard term infant formulas, tolerance, and specialized formulas are routinely used for high-risk full-term infants and some preterm infants with specific conditions. These are reviewed in detail in chapter 5, "Enteral Nutrition." This section will review the currently available infant formulas indicated for preterm infants. Preterm infant formulas have been developed to meet the nutrition needs of growing preterm infants with consideration of their GI immaturity and specific nutrient requirements (see Tables 7-24 and 7-25). These formulas have been shown to improve weight gain and bone mineralization approaching that of the fetus when compared with preterm infants fed term formulas. ${ }^{13}$ They are available as ready-to-feed (RTF) sterile liquids at 20, 24, and $30 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{oz}$ and contain significantly higher levels of protein, minerals and vitamins compared with term infant formulas.

Preterm infant formulas are not routinely available outside of the hospital, and infants are typically transitioned to preterm discharge formulas between 34 and 36 weeks' GA. For infants with a history of osteopenia of prematurity or a prolonged course of PN, preterm infant formulas may be used to supplement mineral intake up to a weight of approximately $3.6 \mathrm{~kg} .{ }^{94}$ Preterm infants are transitioned to preterm discharge formulas before discharge from the hospital. These formulas are enriched with protein and minerals, are standard at $22 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{oz}$, and are available as an RTF liquid and powder. Infants will require vitamin D supplementation to meet the recommended dietary allowance until taking at least $24 \mathrm{oz} / \mathrm{d} .^{95,96}$

# Feeding Initiation and Advancement 

Initiating feedings in the neonate requires careful consideration of clinical status, medical and surgical history, GA, and developmental maturity. Coordinated suck-swallow-breathe patterns for nutritive feeding are not generally present before 32 weeks' GA. Although research has shown some infants have coordinated suck-swallow-breathe patterns at earlier GAs, successful nutritive feeding also relies on a degree of physiologic development and maturity that may vary even between infants of similar GA. The goal is to provide care that facilitates appropriate development and to identify each infant's maturational state prior to initiating oral feedings. ${ }^{97}$ Specific variables must be considered to determine an infant's oral feeding readiness:

- GA at birth
- GA at time oral feeding is considered

--- page 244 ---

- Severity of illness
- Respiratory and cardiovascular stability (need for oxygen, apnea, or bradycardia events)
- Motor stability (tone, posture, quality of movement)
- Sucking, swallowing, and breathing coordination
- Temperature stability
- Alertness
- Hunger cues
- Tolerance of enteral feedings

Full-term infants may be able to initiate feedings orally by breast or bottle if their clinical status allows. If a family's goal is to breastfeed their baby, every effort should be made to work toward this goal. Many hospitalized term neonates will not be able to feed at the breast from the start of feedings because of their medical condition and required care, but by working with a multidisciplinary team, including a lactation consultant, important steps can be taken to promote the maternal milk supply and improve the chance of a successful breastfeeding outcome. ${ }^{98}$ Recommendations have been published to support breastfeeding success in late preterm and early term infants. ${ }^{99}$ Baby-Friendly USA, Inc, serves as the national authority for the WHO/United Nations Children's Fund Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative in the United States and has published 10 steps and recommendations for successful breastfeeding adapted for the NICU setting. ${ }^{100}$

Tube feedings are routinely administered in the hospitalized neonate if the infant is unable to feed orally. The gastric route, accessed by orogastric or NG feeding tubes is most common (see chapter 5, "Enteral Nutrition"). Postpyloric feeding is used less commonly and may offer some advantages in certain patients; however, this practice has not been well studied in the modern era of neonatology. ${ }^{101}$ Feedings should be initiated as soon as the infant is medically stable to feed, ideally within 48 hours for preterm infants if clinically stable. ${ }^{102}$

Delays initiating even trophic feeds or "minimal enteral feeding" (MEF) for preterm infants should be avoided because they may impact the infant's immature GI tract, potentially contributing to feeding intolerance, and have been associated with intestinal inflammation and an increased risk of morbidities. ${ }^{103,104}$ Gastric route feedings may be administered by bolus or continuously on a feeding pump, and postpyloric feedings should only be administered by continuous infusion.

There are potential advantages and disadvantages of these feeding administration methods, and changes to the route and administration method may help with individual patient feeding tolerance but this has not been well studied (Table 7-26). ${ }^{105,106}$ Term and late preterm infant feedings can be initiated at $30-40 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ and advanced by this volume daily to goal. Feedings for infants with congenital GI defects requiring surgery are typically initiated at lower volumes and advanced more slowly. ${ }^{107}$ Providing trophic feeding or MEF for a period of time prior to advancing is common for VLBW infants, typically at less than $25 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$, but the duration is still a matter of debate. ${ }^{108}$ For moderate and very preterm infants, feeding initiation and advancement volumes have been debated in the literature, but a recent meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including over 4000 preterm infants concluded that the low volume and slow advancement of feedings ( $15-20 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ ) did not reduce the risk of NEC or death in very preterm or VLBW infants when compared with faster advancement $(30-40 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}) .{ }^{109}$

It is important to consider each infant's individual risk factors when determining feeding initiation and advancement. In addition, the RCT that provides most of the data for the meta-analysis did not include many ELBW infants and human milk fortification practices were not tracked, although most infants received human milk and formula. ${ }^{110}$ Feeding tolerance should be monitored closely as feedings advance. Routine monitoring of gastric residual volumes is not recommended. Signs of or concerns about feeding intolerance should be accompanied by serial abdominal examinations and consideration of clinical signs such as apnea, bradycardia, and temperature instability. ${ }^{111}$

# Micronutrient Requirements of the Enterally Fed Infant 

The absorption of micronutrients will be impacted by clinical conditions. For example, calcium and phosphorus absorption are influenced by postnatal age and vitamin D, lactose, and fat intake. In preterm infants, however, vitamin D may contribute little to calcium absorption. ${ }^{112}$ Suggested enteral intakes for other micronutrients are listed in Table 7-27. The appropriate enteral intake for a particular nutrient can be estimated from established rates of intrauterine accretion, plus estimation of daily losses, divided by the bioavailability (net absorption) of the nutrient. ${ }^{113}$

# Vitamin Needs 

Vitamins are supplied to the fetus via maternal transfer. Water-soluble vitamins are actively transported across the placenta throughout pregnancy, whereas the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, and E are transferred

--- page 247 ---

during the last trimester of pregnancy. There is negligible transfer of vitamin $\mathrm{K} .{ }^{114}$ Human milk from mothers with adequate vitamin stores contains sufficient amounts of most vitamins apart from vitamins D and K . Thus, unsupplemented infants depend on antenatally acquired hepatic stores as well as cutaneous synthesis in response to sunlight for vitamin D and depend on synthesis by gut bacteria for vitamin K. Human milk alone does not provide infants with an adequate amount of vitamin D. Within days after birth, most infants will need an additional source of vitamin D. To avoid developing a vitamin D deficiency, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommend that breastfed and partially breastfed infants be supplemented with $10 \mu \mathrm{~g}$ ( 400 IU ) per day of vitamin D beginning in the first few days of life and that this be continued until the child is fully weaned and drinking fortified milk. Table 7-28 summarizes current recommendations for enteral vitamin intake in the neonate and infant.

# Monitoring 

Neonates receiving EN support require careful growth monitoring as previously described. If growth target growth rates are not achieved, the feeding plan should first be evaluated to ensure it meets recommended energy and protein requirements for the infant's size and age. Calorie and protein intakes may be increased with a higher feeding volume, further fortification of human milk, the addition of a

--- page 249 ---

calorie or protein modular, and the concentration of infant formula to $22-30 \mathrm{cal} / \mathrm{oz}$. If the infant requires intakes greater than the typical requirements and growth remains inadequate, other factors may need to be considered, such as the underlying condition, clinical status changes, anemia, carbohydrate or fat malabsorption, medications, nutrient losses due to the feeding administration method, or electrolyte losses. ${ }^{115}$

No routine biochemical monitoring is required for the enterally fed neonate, with the only exceptions being certain populations of preterm infants or those receiving medications that may impact the nutrition or electrolyte status. The AAP recommends routine evaluation of the bone mineral status for preterm infants born weighting less than 1500 g , with testing including alkaline phosphatase and serum phosphorus levels starting at $4-5$ weeks of age. ${ }^{116}$ The adequacy of the dietary intake of calcium and phosphorus should be monitored, and factors that could contribute to poor mineral intake or increased losses should be addressed. Routine monitoring of ferritin levels to assess iron status has also been recommended for VLBW infants during NICU admission. ${ }^{117,118}$ A ferritin level of less than $35-70$ $\mu \mathrm{g} / \mathrm{L}$ requires increased iron dose to $3-4 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ (maximum of $6 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ ) and a level of greater than $300 \mu \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L}$ may warrant a decrease in iron supplementation or fortification. It should be noted that as an acute-phase reactant, ferritin is not a reliable marker of iron status during periods of acute inflammation or stress; levels will be elevated. ${ }^{119}$

# Conclusion 

The nutrition care of the neonate, whether full term or preterm, brings unique challenges during this critical period of growth and development. As advances in neonatology have led to decreased mortality rates for the preterm infant, new challenges have emerged when attempting to optimize their nutrition needs. The preterm infant is born with increased energy needs coupled with limited nutrient stores. This is further exacerbated by the physiologic demands of prematurity itself, as there are disruptions in nutrient delivery that lead to additional nutritional deficits. Evidence has shown that postnatal growth restriction, specifically a slow rate of growth during and after a NICU stay, is strongly associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. ${ }^{119,120}$ Moreover, complications such as respiratory distress and osteopenia that are associated with prematurity can further complicate the ability to provide optimal nutrition safely. Despite these challenges, the goal is to strive to maintain intrauterine growth rates and optimize outcomes in this vulnerable population.

## Allergy and Eosinophilic Esophagitis

Anam Bashir, MD<br>Praveen S. Goday, MBBS

## Introduction

A food allergy is an adverse reaction arising from a specific immune response that occurs reproducibly on exposure to a given food. Based on the pathophysiologic characteristics, food allergies are classified as immunoglobin E (IgE)-mediated, non-IgE-mediated, or mixed type (Table 8-1). Major food allergens include cow's milk, eggs, soy, fish/shellfish, peanut/tree nuts, and wheat. IgE-mediated reactions are rapid, beginning within minutes to 2 hours from ingestion with a wide spectrum of manifestations involving the skin, respiratory system, gastrointestinal (GI) system, and cardiovascular system. Non-IgEmediated reactions are more subacute or chronic and usually involve the GI system and skin. The mainstay of management of food allergies is avoidance of the specific food. ${ }^{1}$

TABLE 8-1. Different Categories of Food Allergies

| Category | Manifestations |
| :-- | :-- |
| IgE-mediated | - Urticaria |
|  | - Angioedema |
|  | - Anaphylaxis |
| Non-IgE-mediated | - FPIES |
|  | - Food protein-induced enteropathy |
|  | - Food protein-induced proctitis |
|  | - Food protein-induced hemosiderosis |
| Mixed | - Atopic dermatitis |
|  | - EoE |
|  | - Eosinophilic gastroenteritis |

Abbreviations: EoE, eosinophilic esophagitis; FPIES, food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome; $\operatorname{IgE}$, immunoglobin $E$.

Children with food allergies may have nutrient deficiencies because of food restriction and are at risk of growth failure, micronutrient deficiency, and feeding difficulties. The child's growth should be closely monitored, and a dietitian should be involved to ensure appropriate dietary intake, particularly when more than one food allergy is present. The role of the dietitian is 2 -fold: education of the child and family to avoid the allergenic foods and suggestion of replacement foods that are of similar nutritional value.

# Assessment and Nutrient Requirements 

Because of allergen avoidance, children with food allergies are at risk for nutrient deficiencies. Assessment involves careful history taking and thorough physical examination.

- History: feeding history, dietary recall, and use of food substitutes
- Nutrition-focused physical examination
- Anthropometric assessment: weight, height or length, head circumference, body mass index, weight for length, and mid-upper arm circumference


## Implementation of Nutrition Plan and Monitoring

--- page 257 ---

The mainstay of managing food allergies is allergen avoidance, therefore it is important that patients and families are educated on the following:

- reading and understanding food labels,
- prevention of cross-contamination through shared utensils and other means, and
- careful replacement with foods that are nutritionally similar and micronutrient supplementation when needed.


# Milk Allergy 

Maternal restriction of cow milk protein is not required for IgE-mediated allergies in breastfed infants. For non-IgE-mediated allergies in infants, maternal dairy elimination is recommended. Infants with a true milk allergy should be given substitute formula like elemental formula or protein hydrolysate formula until 2 years of age. These formulas are complete sources of calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D , vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$, riboflavin, and pantothenic acid. For toddlers with cow milk protein allergy, an elemental pediatric formula can be an appropriate replacement.

Some plant-based milks like enriched soy milk may be a suitable replacement. Pea protein-based milk, depending on the specific energy, protein, vitamin, and mineral content of the product, may also be an alternative for children who are allergic to both cow and soy milk. In general, almond, rice, coconut, hemp, flax seed, and cashew milks do not meet protein, calcium, and vitamin D needs of toddlers and should be avoided when used as the primary nutritious beverage. ${ }^{1,2}$

## Egg Allergy

Eggs are a source of vitamins $\mathrm{B}_{2}, \mathrm{~B}_{3}, \mathrm{~B}_{12}$, E, folic acid, biotin, selenium, iron, and chromium. ${ }^{3}$ Other foods such as milk, soy, meat, and fish can be the source of these micronutrients. Because eggs do not account for a large percentage of daily diet, sole egg avoidance is unlikely to cause significant deficiencies. Eggs are frequently used in recipes, so parents should know how to replace eggs in such recipes. ${ }^{1}$

--- page 258 ---

# Soybean Allergy 

Soy is rich in thiamin, vitamin $B_{2}$, niacin, iron, zinc, selenium, chromium, and folic acid. ${ }^{3}$ Soy does not constitute a large portion of diet, therefore sole soy restriction is unlikely to cause nutrient deficiencies. Soybeans are found in products like tofu, edamame, tempeh, and soy sauce. Heat-pressed soybean oil and lecithin, commonly found in packaged foods, are highly refined and generally well tolerated because soy protein is removed. Children with concomitant cow milk and soy allergies are at high risk of nutrient deficiencies and require very careful nutrition management. ${ }^{1}$

## Wheat Allergy

Wheat is a major source of carbohydrates. Wheat is also rich in micronutrients like thiamin, vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{2}$, niacin, iron, zinc, selenium, chromium, and folic acid. ${ }^{3}$ Alternative grains and flours like rice, corn, oat, barley, quinoa, buckwheat, millet, amaranth, potato, and arrowroot can serve as suitable replacements. Patients can have allergy to multiple grains, so tolerance of other grains should be monitored. ${ }^{1}$

## Nuts

Nuts do not form a large portion of daily dietary intake and hence do not need replacement. Tree nuts include almond, cashew, chestnut, macadamia, pecan, pine nut, pistachio, Brazil nut, filbert/hazelnut, and walnut. ${ }^{1}$ Nuts are commonly found in confectionery foods such as candy and cookies, and food labels need to be read very carefully. Peanut oil is safe if it is heat pressed, but crude peanut oil should be avoided.

## Food Protein-Induced Enterocolitis

Food protein-induced enterocolitis (FPIES) is a potential emergency, which can present in infants and young children with vomiting and diarrhea severe enough to cause hemodynamic instability. Symptoms

--- page 259 ---

develop 1-4 hours after ingestion and resolve 24 hours after ingestion. The diagnosis is made clinically with improvement after withdrawal of the allergen. The mainstay of management of FPIES is elimination of trigger foods from the diet.

# Implementation of Nutrition Plan and Monitoring 

Particularly with FPIES to multiple foods, the risk of nutrient deficiency increases, and consultation with a dietitian is recommended. Infants with FPIES should be on extensively hydrolyzed formula. Some children may require elemental formula. Foods that enhance feeding skills with various tastes and textures are recommended. Timely introduction of different flavors and textures positively impacts feeding skills. ${ }^{4}$

## Eosinophilic Esophagitis

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic allergen-mediated esophageal inflammatory disease. Classic symptoms include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, malnutrition, feeding disorder, and food impaction. Diagnosis is usually made by upper endoscopy and biopsy confirmation of elevated eosinophilic counts in esophageal tissue. Treatment includes dietary therapy and medications. Medications include proton pump inhibitors, topical corticosteroids, and monoclonal antibodies. Dietary therapies include elemental diet, allergen-directed elimination diet, and empiric elimination diet. We will focus on the dietary management of EoE.

## Implementation of Nutrition Plan and Monitoring

Elemental (or amino acid-based) formula eliminates all potential food allergens. It is $90 \%$ effective in the treatment of EoE in children and adults. The approach is very effective but because the diet is restricted solely to formula with poor palatability, it is associated with a lower quality of life.

--- page 260 ---

An allergen-directed elimination diet refers to the avoidance of foods that are identified as allergens via allergy testing. It has been successful only in less than $50 \%$ of patients with EoE and is not recommended.

Empiric elimination diets involve removing the most common food allergens (cow's milk, wheat, soy, egg, peanut/tree nut, fish/shellfish). The efficacy of the 6 -food elimination diet, wherein all the most common food allergens are eliminated, is around $70 \%$. However, in an effort to decrease food restriction and improve quality of life, decreasing the number of eliminated foods and a step-up of empiric diet is possible.

The rates of success vary from approximately $50 \%$ for elimination of cow's milk alone (the most common food allergen implicated in EoE) to $64 \%$ for 4 -food elimination diet (cow's milk, soy, egg, and wheat).

With the empiric elimination diets, histologic response is monitored, and foods can be sequentially eliminated (when response is inadequate) or reintroduced (when response is good) to enable the patient to be on the least restrictive diet needed for the optimal therapy for EoE. ${ }^{5}$

With the avoidance of foods that constitute a major portion of the diet, understanding how to avoid the allergenic foods and then optimally replace them is crucial. Such education by a registered dietitian is important to avoid malnutrition and nutrient deficiencies.

## Cardiac Disease

Erin Sullivan, RD, LDN, CSPCC<br>Sharon Y. Irving, PhD, CRNP<br>Vijay Srinivasan, MBBS, MD<br>Chitra Ravishankar, MBBS, MRCP (UK)

## Introduction

Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth anomaly in children with a prevalence in 9 of 1000 live births. ${ }^{1}$ A significant proportion of neonates with a CHD diagnosis will not survive without a surgical or catheter-based intervention in the newborn period. ${ }^{2}$ As survival has improved, both short-term and long-term morbidities assume greater importance and have been brought to the forefront. Issues with feeding and growth are major concerns for children with CHD. ${ }^{3}$ Most neonates with CHD are born at term with anthropometric measurements that fall within the reference range, but they quickly begin to experience nutrition challenges that place them at high risk for growth failure and malnutrition. All neonates who require cardiac surgery within the first few days to weeks of life are at risk for growth faltering. Length is affected as much as weight with less recovery of length compared with weight. In fact, short stature is a life-long issue for children with CHD, ${ }^{4,5}$ particularly for those with univentricular or single-ventricle heart defects.

--- page 263 ---

To identify best nutrition practices to improve growth, the National Pediatric Cardiology Quality Improvement Collaborative (NPC-QIC) formed a Feeding Workgroup composed of surgeons, physicians, dietitians, speech and occupational therapists, nurses, and parents from over 50 centers across North America. ${ }^{6}$ This workgroup has provided best practice recommendations to promote a uniform approach to nutrition of children with CHD across institutions. The value of a structured nutrition program with establishment of best practices in nutrition (assessment, prescription, delivery and evaluation) is well recognized in the current era among patients with heart defects. ${ }^{6,7}$

In this chapter, we focus on nutrition considerations in neonates who require cardiac interventions within the first few days to weeks of life. These principles can also be applied broadly to older children with congenital and acquired cardiac defects, including those presenting with heart failure.

# Risks and Special Considerations 

The etiology of growth failure is multifactorial from a combination of inadequate caloric intake; high metabolic demand; gastrointestinal (GI) pathology, including malabsorption and gastroesophageal reflux (GER); and endocrine and genetic factors. ${ }^{3}$ Factors that impede the delivery of adequate enteral nutrition in the cardiac population include vocal cord dysfunction, poor oral coordination and endurance, emesis, and feeding intolerance. Other challenges include concerns for poor cardiac output, the need for inotropic support, limitations of fluid intake, the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), and frequent interruptions in nutrient delivery because of both patient-specific factors as well as diagnostic and therapeutic considerations.

Neonates with CHD experience NEC more commonly compared with healthy neonates who have reported incidence of $2.5 \%-5 \%$ and may experience significant morbidity. ${ }^{8}$ Neonates with CHD who are treated with prostaglandin infusion to maintain patency of the ductus arteriosus are at risk for splanchnic ischemia owing to the presence of diastolic vascular runoff and reversal of flow in the mesenteric artery. This risk

--- page 264 ---

persists in infants with shunt-dependent circulation, including those with an aortopulmonary shunt or a stent in the patent ductus arteriosus. Prematurity substantially increases the risk of NEC. Other potential risk factors include chronic cyanosis, the presence of umbilical arterial catheters, and the inflammatory cascade activated by cardiopulmonary bypass. The Feeding Workgroup of the NPC-QIC has focused on addressing these concerns in single-ventricle patients who are considered the highest risk for intestinal hypoperfusion and NEC. ${ }^{9}$

# Assessment and Nutrient Requirements 

## Anthropometry and Energy Expenditure

For hospitalized neonates with CHD,

- weight should be measured daily (unless hemodynamically unstable)
- length should be measured weekly
- head circumference should be measured monthly

Fluid shifts and fluid overload may affect anthropometric measurements, especially weight. There is no evidence to support the use of biochemical markers to monitor nutrition status. Studies have shown that standard predictive equations frequently overestimate energy needs in the postoperative period. While it is technically challenging to accurately measure resting energy expenditure (REE) in mechanically ventilated patients, indirect calorimetry (IC) may be used to measure REE in postoperative patients. ${ }^{10}$ When IC is not available or practical, use the Schofield equation to estimate energy needs.

## Implementation of Nutrition Plan and Monitoring

Nutrition therapy for infants and children with CHD is vital to the care continuum and life span-from acute critical illness through chronic illness and from infancy through adulthood. Accurate assessment of nutrition requirements and provision of adequate nutrition through the most physiologically appropriate route play an important role in

--- page 265 ---

enhancing outcomes. ${ }^{11}$ Close monitoring and evaluation are required to minimize risk of malnutrition and its complications.

# Preoperative Feeding Guidelines 

Prostaglandin infusions are not a contraindication to enteral feeding. There is sufficient evidence to support the safe provision of enteral feeds in the preoperative period in hemodynamically stable neonates treated with prostaglandin infusion. ${ }^{9}$ Enteral feeding can be achieved safely with appropriate vigilance and intensive monitoring. Oral ad lib feedings should be encouraged, although early feeding intolerance may suggest poor systemic perfusion and/or impending shock or NEC states.

Human milk is the preferred feeding option given its immunologic benefits and high biologically available protein. Standard infant formula is used when human milk is not available with specialty formula preparations as dictated by the clinical condition. Early initiation of parenteral nutrition (PN) is important to promote positive nitrogen balance and mitigate perioperative risk of malnutrition. Umbilical catheters are not a contraindication to enteral feeding.

## Postoperative Nutrition Support

The best surgical outcomes are accomplished when patients can establish positive nitrogen balance and maintain good nutrition status postoperatively. The goal of postoperative nutrition management is to optimize nutrient delivery while accounting for changes in the hemodynamic and medical stability of the patient. Evidence suggests that there are 3 predominant phases in critically ill children during which macronutrient requirements change considerably:

1. Acute phase
2. Stable phase
3. Recovery phase

Metabolic targets and nutrition goals change based on the phase of disease state, but generally growth is not a critical priority in the immediate postoperative period. Growth does not resume until the

--- page 266 ---

postoperative stress response resolves, and positive nitrogen balance is attained.

Studies of REE in critically ill infants after cardiac surgery have observed that outcomes are improved with a minimum intake of 43 $\mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$. Energy needs are reduced for the first $3-5$ postoperative days: approximately $55-65 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$. As patients recover, energy needs increase substantially: at least $120-150 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$. Estimated nutrition needs require reassessment at regular intervals (see Table 9-1.) ${ }^{12}$

The following are general guidelines for provision of nutrition in the postoperative period:

- Use PN in the early postoperative period while advancing enteral feeds.
- Initiate enteral feeds as early as possible once hemodynamic stability is established.
- Consider use of a standardized protocol or algorithm for nutrition delivery that includes guidance on type of feeds, mode of feeding, feed advance, and relative contraindications/considerations or "red flags" ${ }^{6,7}$ (see Figure 9-1).

Types of feeds include the following:

- Human milk is preferred but often needs to be fortified, and higher concentration standard formulas are frequently required.
- In infants with a history of NEC or significant feeding intolerance, the use of semielemental or elemental formulas may be more appropriate.

--- page 270 ---

- Emerging literature suggests that peptide nutrient-energy dense formulas can be safely provided to neonates and infants with CHD. ${ }^{16}$

Postpyloric rather than gastric tube feedings are frequently used in infants with marginal respiratory status and in those with severe GER. Optimization of therapy for GER includes the use of alternative formulas, appropriate positioning, and medications such as prokinetic agents and proton pump inhibitors. Standardization of airway evaluation and assessment of safe swallowing ability in infants with suspected or confirmed vocal cord injury and feeding difficulties with oral aversion is key to facilitate and establish oral feeding.

# Special Situations 

## Chylothorax

Chylothorax, or an accumulation of milky-appearing chyle within the pleural space, is a well-known and increasingly more-prevalent complication of cardiac surgery and is associated with greater postoperative morbidity and mortality. This condition is estimated to occur in $2.5 \%-4.7 \%$ of patients after cardiac surgery. ${ }^{17}$ Chylothorax occurs most often as a result of traumatic injury of the thoracic duct or its surrounding lymphatic tributaries during surgery (eg, repair of coarctation or vascular ring), thrombosis of the superior vena cava resulting in occlusion, or elevated central venous pressures postoperatively (as seen in cavopulmonary connections). ${ }^{17}$ Children with genetic syndromes, including trisomy 21, Noonan and Turner syndromes, and cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome, frequently have abnormalities in their lymphatic system and are also at higher risk for developing chylothorax after cardiac surgery.

Recognizing the large and often unnecessary practice variation in management of chylous effusions and leaks, a Pediatric Critical Care Consortium Chylothorax Workgroup representing 22 cardiac centers has recently published an algorithm to standardize and guide for making diagnostic decisions, selecting first line medical therapies, and identifying timing and duration of interventions (Figure 9-2). ${ }^{18}$

(b)

# BOX 1: Diagnostic Studies to Consider 

Concern for chylothorax may include: milky CTO, CTO $>20 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day beginning 24 hours after chest closure, surgeon concern based on surgical findings, etc.
Pleural fluid studies confirmatory for chylothorax (at least 1 of the following must be positive):

- Triglycerides ( $>110 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ )
- Lymphocyte predominance ( $>00 \%$ )
- Positive chylomicrons
- Pleural>serum triglycerides

BOX 2: Etiology Work-up (Risk factors: previous chylothorax, elevated venous pressure, decreased function, and VTE)
-Venous doppler head/neck ultrasound: If VTE present, provide anticoagulation per institutional standard.
-Echo to include evaluation of SVC for thrombus and consider venogram with negative echo but suspicion for VTE remains high.
-Prior to referral to lymphatic center, complete echocardiogram and diagnostic cardiac catheterization are recommended.

## Box 3: Diet Modifications Following Chylous Effusion Diagnosis

Defatted human milk, fortify as below with MCT based formula for $<1$ year of age. Supplement with ADEK multivitamin.

## MCT based enteral formulas:

$<1$ year of age: Monogen*, Enfaport, Lipstart*, or Vivonex Pediatric* (for milk protein intolerance). Supplement with 400 IU Vitamin D/day. 1-13 years of age: Monogen, Vivonex Pediatric (for milk protein intolerance), or Portagen.**
Medium Chain Triglyceride (MCT) Based Calorie Modulars: MCT oil ( 8 Cal/ml), Nutricia Liquigen ( $4.5 \mathrm{Cal} / \mathrm{ml}$ ), Vitalfo MCT Procal ( 112 Cal/1 powder packet).

Oral Fat Modified Diet:
Start $\leq 10 \mathrm{~g}$ fat/day from long-chain triglycerides to provide $2-4 \%$ total calories from linoleic acid (LA) and $0.25-0.5 \%$ from alpha-linolenic acid (ALA).

## Essential Fatty Acid (EFA) Deficiency Monitoring:

EFA deficiency may develop in 1-3 weeks on no/low exogenous EFA delivery. Watch for physical symptoms including dry/scaly rash, sparse hair, poor wound healing.
For prolonged restriction or manifestation of symptoms: obtain EFA profiles, monitoring triene:tetraene ratio ( $>0.4$ diagnostic of EFA deficiency), LFTs, platelets.

Parenteral Nutrition: Optimize calories and protein. Protein may need to be increased by $1.5-2 \times$ RDA/DRI ( $0-2$ years old: provide $3-4 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg}$; preterm: provide $3.5-4 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg}$ ).
Dose lipids (IL) per needs/tolerance but with minimum of $0.5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day $20 \%$ IL or $1 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day SMOF (goal is $2 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day SMOF for $0-12$ months of age) in order to deliver $\sim 0.1 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day LA. For preterm infants, double lipid dose in order to deliver the minimum $0.25 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day LA to prevent EFA deficiency.

Parental Nutrition Screening Labs: daily until stability: electrolytes (BMP) including Mg, PO4; 1-2x/week: triglycerides, LFTs and albumin.
*Nutritionally complete but off label use in patients less than 1 yo
**Not nutritionally complete, requires trace mineral supplementation

## BOX 4: Additional Therapies

Additional considerations for refractory chylothorax: defined as 7 cumulative days of NPO with chest tube output remaining $>10 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day Please refer to Supplemental Table 3 for a review of potential additional therapies.

## BOX 5: Fat-modified Diet Duration

Concurrent PC4 Chylothorax Work Group project aims to decrease current fat-modified diet duration at individual institutions by 2 weeks from the previous institutional standard to a minimum of 2 weeks.

If no current institutional standard, we recommend no more than 4 week duration of fat-modified diet duration.

## FIGURE 9-2. (Continued)

--- page 273 ---

Chylothorax management involves strategies to decrease thoracic flow, allowing the lymphatic channels to heal primarily through pleural space evacuation via chest tubes and the minimization of exposure to long-chain triglycerides (LCTs). LCTs bind with chyle to form chylomicrons for absorption and transport to the bloodstream by intestinal lymphatics, whereas medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) are directly absorbed by enterocytes into the portal venous system and do not stimulate an increase in lymphatic flow. ${ }^{19}$ Diet modification, with use of low-fat diets supplemented with MCTs for 4-6 weeks, has been successfully used as a conservative strategy to reduce lymphatic flow (see Table 9-2).

${ }^{a}$ Compiled from published manufacturer product information. Always confirm nutrient contents with manufacturer.

Inadequate dietary intake of linoleic acid (LA) and $\alpha$-LA (ALA) associated with prolonged dietary fat restriction can cause essential fattyacid deficiency. Minimal intake of $1 \%$ of energy from LA (C18:2) and at least $0.2 \%$ from ALA is recommended to decrease risk of deficiency. ${ }^{20}$

--- page 274 ---

An abnormal triene/tetraene ratio ( $>0.2$ ), is indicative of essential fattyacid deficiency. ${ }^{21}$

Prolonged dietary restriction is not recommended and may be harmful, resulting in nutrition deficiencies of essential fatty acids and fatsoluble vitamins, elevated transaminases, thrombocytopenia, poor wound healing, scaly dermatitis, hypertriglyceridemia, and growth failure. Vitamin D and calcium supplementation are necessary in patients on MCT oil-rich diets.

Resumption of regular diet, human milk, or standard formula in a stepped approach 4-6 weeks after resolution of chylous drainage and completion of low-fat diet therapy is necessary to minimize the risk of essential fatty-acid and fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies. Patients may need PN formulations containing LA and ALA to prevent essential, fattyacid deficiency.

# Protein-Losing Enteropathy 

Protein-losing enteropathy (PLE) occurs when excess albumin and other protein-rich materials leak into the intestine, causing general abdominal discomfort/bloating, malabsorptive diarrhea, electrolyte derangements, and ascites. PLE occurs almost exclusively after the Fontan operation. An elevated level of stool $\alpha-1$-antitrypsin indicates a general state of GI protein loss and is the primary diagnostic marker for PLE. A diet rich in protein is recommended for patients with PLE. There is no evidence to support the use of a fat-restricted diet in the management of PLE.

## Celiac Disease

Anam Bashir, MD<br>Praveen S. Goday, MBBS

## Introduction

Celiac disease is an autoimmune enteropathy triggered by the intake of gluten, a protein complex found in wheat, barley, and rye. Patients can present with growth failure, osteopenia, and anemia. Celiac disease causes villous damage in the small intestine that leads to malabsorption and risk of various nutrient deficiencies. With the exclusion of gluten, patients need to avoid cereals that are either rich in or fortified with vitamins and minerals and hence are at risk of micronutrient deficiencies. Also, commercially available gluten-free foods are typically not fortified and contain lower amounts of micronutrients. Treatment of patients with celiac disease should include strategies to prevent nutrition deficiencies. At the time of diagnosis, patients may be deficient in iron, vitamin D, zinc, calcium, and folic acid. These deficiencies improve with treatment, and there is lack of consensus on usefulness of periodic assessment for micronutrient deficiencies.

## Assessment and Nutrient Requirements

A careful history review, examination, and evaluation are critical for all patients with celiac disease to ensure appropriate nutrient provision.

--- page 278 ---

- History: Extensive review of dietary history to identify any inadvertent exposure to gluten
- Nutrition-focused physical examination
- Anthropometric assessment: Weight, height/length, head circumference, body mass index, weight for length, and mid-upper arm circumference
- Laboratory assessment: screening for micronutrient deficiency at diagnosis and periodically, if needed


# Implementation of Nutrition Plan and Monitoring 

The fundamental treatment of patients with celiac disease is a lifelong gluten-free diet, which involves avoidance of wheat, barley, and rye (Table 10-1). Natural gluten-free foods such as meat, fish, legumes, and vegetables should be encouraged because their nutritional value is higher than commercially prepared gluten-free foods in terms of lipid composition and vitamin content.

--- page 279 ---

TABLE 10-1. List of Common Gluten-Containing and GlutenFree Foods

| Gluten-Containing <br> Foods | Gluten-Free Foods | Foods That May <br> Contain Gluten |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |

Detailed food-label reading and education with a registered dietitian to ensure patients are not inadvertently consuming gluten is recommended. For example, oats that are labeled as gluten free can be consumed, whereas other oats may be contaminated with wheat during processing (Exhibit 10-1). Pseudocereals such as quinoa and buckwheat are considered good alternatives because they have ample fiber, vitamin, proteins, and polyunsaturated fatty acids. For foods to be labeled gluten free, the gluten level should be less than 20 ppm . Consumption of more than $10-100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ can cause mucosal damage. ${ }^{1}$

# EXHIBIT 10-1. Common Sources of Contamination 

- Lipstick/lip gloss/lip balms
- Oral care and dental products
- Herbal supplements
- Prescription medications
- Over-the-counter medications
- Play-Doh
- Probiotics


## Prevention of Micronutrient and Vitamin Deficiency

Celiac disease can affect bone health. Age-appropriate calcium and vitamin D intake and regular exercise to promote bone health should be encouraged. ${ }^{2}$

With prolonged delay in diagnosis of celiac disease or symptomatic patients with rickets or bone pain, laboratory testing including 25hydroxy vitamin D, calcium, phosphate, and parathyroid hormone levels should be considered. Patients with deficiencies should be treated, and annual screening should be repeated until levels normalize. At diagnosis, because of malabsorption, an evaluation for iron-deficiency anemia with iron studies is recommended. A complete blood cell count and iron studies should also be obtained annually.

Gluten-free diets are known to be low in vitamins $\mathrm{D}, \mathrm{E}$, and $\mathrm{B}_{12}$, folate, iron, magnesium, potassium, calcium, zinc, and sodium. Longterm, a complete multivitamin-multimineral preparation that is gluten free should be considered. ${ }^{3}$

# Critical Illness 

Sharon Y. Irving, PhD, CRNP<br>Stephanie Seiple, RD, LDN, CNSC<br>Vijay Srinivasan, MBBS, MD

## Introduction

Critical illness or trauma in children is a complex state characterized by abnormal vital organ function that, if untreated, will progress to lifethreatening physiologic deterioration and mortality. ${ }^{1}$ During critical illness, the mechanical, hormonal, immunologic, and motility functions of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and associated organs are disrupted to varying degrees, resulting in pathologic changes in nutrient absorption, digestion, and metabolism. The stress response to critical illness is further influenced by pre-illness metabolism and nutrition status. ${ }^{2,3}$ It is well established that preexisting malnutrition can be a major determinant of patient response to intensive care unit (ICU) therapies. ${ }^{4-7}$ Irrespective of nutrition status, current evidence supports the provision of nutrition therapy early and throughout the course of critical illness. ${ }^{4,8}$

The physiologic route for delivery of nutrition is via the GI tract and is preferred even during critical illness states. Nutrition delivery using the GI tract is not only physiologic and cost efficient but also helps to maintain mucosal integrity through modifying the microbiome and decreasing the risk of bacterial translocation, which can exacerbate the

--- page 282 ---

course of critical illness. Studies of critically ill children who received enteral nutrition (EN) early in the course of illness demonstrate association with tolerance of feeds, decreased intensive care and hospital lengths of stay, decreased need for mechanical ventilation, reduction in the rate of acquired infections, and overall improved outcomes. ${ }^{4,8-11}$

The decision of when to initiate nutrition involves recognition of the pre-illness nutrition status and keen understanding of the multifactorial dynamic changes that occur during critical illness. Initiation and assessment of nutrition during critical illness requires a team of professionals. The registered dietitian (RD) plays a key role together with the physician, nurse, pharmacist, and parents/caregivers of the child to optimize prescription, delivery, and monitoring of nutrient intake. ${ }^{12}$ Using a team-based approach, nutrition therapy during critical illness aims to meet both baseline metabolic needs to promote growth while simultaneously counteracting the stress response to illness to support a positive nitrogen balance and preserve lean body mass. ${ }^{2,3}$

# Assessment of Nutrition Status 

## General Principles

A comprehensive nutrition status assessment is the first step and key component to optimizing nutrition therapy during critical illness. The RD plays a key role in nutrition assessment to facilitate accurate and appropriate nutrient prescription. ${ }^{12}$ Full dietary and medical history should be obtained as soon as possible following pediatric ICU (PICU) admission to facilitate early initiation of nutrition therapy. Current pediatric nutrition screening tools can be helpful as part of a general nutrition assessment and screening to examine patients at risk for nutrition deterioration. ${ }^{13}$ However, these tools have not been validated in critical illness.

## Anthropometry

--- page 283 ---

Traditional anthropometric measurements, consisting of weight, length, and head circumference, should be obtained as soon as possible upon admission to the PICU to facilitate assessment of the child's nutrition status and guide delivery of care. Additionally, mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) is a measure of combined muscle and fat mass and may be used as a proxy for fat stores and muscle accretion. MUAC is considered more sensitive to changes in muscle and fat mass and less sensitive to fluid shifts in critically ill states. ${ }^{14}$

No published standards exist to define optimal frequency for obtaining anthropometric measurements in critically ill children. The clinical status of the patient, essential therapies, and unit- or hospital-specific standards typically guide the frequency of obtaining anthropometric measurements during critical illness. Factors to consider include the following:

- Weight may be measured daily but may also be obtained less frequently (weekly to several times per week) and must be interpreted with caution, as this parameter is easily influenced by patient age, clinical status, and changes in fluid balance due to resuscitation and fluid shifts, fluid administered, and use of medications, including diuretic agents.
- Stature/length/height should be assessed at least monthly or more frequently based on clinical concerns especially in very young infants and children.
- Length is measured in children less than 2 years of age.
- Height is measured in children equal to or greater than 2 years (if clinically appropriate). Note: Many critically ill children are unable to stand for a height measurement, and alternative methods to obtain height may be necessary.
- Critically ill children with contractures or other skeletal deformities (eg, scoliosis) require alternative measures for stature measurement (forearm length, knee-heel length, upper arm length, arm span, etc). These must be obtained by trained personnel who are experienced with these measurements (see chapter 1, "Nutrition Screening and History").
- Head circumference (also referred to as frontal-occipital circumference) should be obtained every 2 weeks in children up to 3 years of age (or more frequently with specific clinical indications or concerns) because this is an important clinical indicator for brain growth and associated abnormalities (eg, hydrocephalus from raised intracranial pressure).
- MUAC can be used to characterize growth and nutrition status and to monitor body composition, using the child as their own control. ${ }^{14}$
- MUAC can be used in special circumstances, including, but not limited to, body edema (particularly lower extremity), ascites, and steroid therapy.
- MUAC should be obtained by RDs or other trained personnel experienced with these measurements.

The critical illness state poses several challenges to obtaining accurate anthropometric measurements:

- severity of illness,
- competing priorities,
- time of day,
- patient clinical state and device challenges (weight),
- safety concerns,
- patient contractures and limb anomalies (stature), and
- medical devices (weight, length, and head circumference).

Serial assessment and monitoring of clinical severity and risk for nutrition deterioration should be conducted.

# Malnutrition 

Malnutrition is a severe imbalance (either deficiencies or excesses) between nutrient requirements and intake manifesting as cumulative alterations of energy, protein, fat, and micronutrients, negatively impacting growth and development ${ }^{15}$ (Table 11-1; see also chapter 2, "Malnutrition," Table 2-1). Malnutrition can be classified as acute or chronic malnutrition ${ }^{15}$ :

- Acute: Typically severe and sudden in onset, less than 3 months
- Chronic: Develops and increases in severity over an extended timeframe ( 3 months or longer)

--- page 285 ---

Malnutrition is associated with immune system dysfunction leading to increased risks of infection, postoperative complications, impaired wound healing, and development of pressure injuries with overall greater morbidity and mortality. Critically ill children are at increased risk for malnutrition during PICU admission. The reported prevalence of malnutrition in the PICU population ranges from $7.2 \%$ to $65 \%,{ }^{16}$ with the widespread range being due to pre-illness nutrition status, patient age, and the parameters and standards used for assessment. ${ }^{14,17}$

# Biomarkers/Laboratory Assessment 

There are no biomarkers specific to clinical GI function available for measurement during critical illness. The visceral proteins, serum albumin

--- page 286 ---

and prealbumin, should not be used or interpreted as nutrition markers as they do not specifically and independently reflect nutrition status during acute critical illness states. ${ }^{18}$ These laboratory values correlate to a greater extent with inflammation and may have an association with the overall clinical status.

# Implementation of Nutrition Plan and Monitoring 

## Nutrition Prescription

Prescription for nutrition therapy should be adequate and individualized to meet energy, protein, and fat requirements to satisfy the metabolic needs of the critically ill child. Clinical status and severity of illness must be considered when prescribing nutrient intake, which will often vary individually by patient. In general, sedation, neuromuscular blockade, or therapeutic hypothermia decrease metabolic demand, whereas persistent fever, seizures, and paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity will increase metabolic needs. For example, the mechanically ventilated patient who is treated with sedation and/or neuromuscular blockade will typically have less energy requirements than the patient treated with noninvasive ventilation support. In contrast, the neurologically impaired patient with autonomic dysfunction and episodes of "storming" often experiences periods of substantial increase in energy expenditure. Similarly, patients with sepsis and uncontrolled inflammation may have increased metabolic needs.

The RD must work with the clinical team to determine appropriate nutrient intake over the course of illness. The clinical status of the child will dictate these needs and may fluctuate throughout the PICU stay, resulting in need to titrate prescriptions for nutrition therapy.

Indirect calorimetry (IC) is a noninvasive, per-breath measurement of respiratory gas exchange (oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production) to determine energy use. ${ }^{19} \mathrm{IC}$ is considered the gold standard to determine energy expenditure. The output of IC measurements can be used to facilitate individualization of the nutrition prescription. Limitations to IC use include the following:

--- page 287 ---

- $\mathrm{FiO}_{2}$ greater than 0.60
- Presence of air leak (eg, pneumothorax, uncuffed endotracheal tube or tracheotomy, inability to capture all exhaled gases)
- Levels of positive end-expiratory pressure; greater than 10 cm of water
- Changing dynamics of clinical status

Considerations for IC use are as follows:

- Cost of equipment
- Need for trained operators
- Accurate interpretation of serial measurements
- Alignment of output with clinical status of the patient
- Knowledge regarding application of these measurements for appropriate decisionmaking to modify nutrient prescription.

Current nutrition intake guidelines recommend use of the Schofield equations ${ }^{20}$ or $\mathrm{WHO}^{21}$ equations to determine energy needs when IC is not used or unavailable ${ }^{4,22}$ (details available in chapter 4, "Infant to Adolescent"). Nutrition therapy prescriptions should be reassessed serially in critically ill children because energy and nutrient needs often dynamically fluctuate over the course of illness, reflecting the state of inflammation and injury. Exogenous protein intake is necessary to prevent muscle degradation, minimize catabolism, limit negative nitrogen balance, and prevent loss of lean muscle mass.

Current ASPEN/Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) guidelines recommend a minimum of $1.5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ for protein intake in critically ill children. ${ }^{4}$ The clinical status may dictate the need for higher levels of protein intake to prevent and/or reverse negative nitrogen balance and support wound healing. Infants and children up to 2 years of age require an intake of $2-3 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d} .^{23}$

# Nutrition Delivery 

EN is the preferred delivery method, because it is physiologically most appropriate based on clinical status. Placement of a nasogastric tube for feedings is common practice in the PICU. Care must be taken to ensure proper placement and tube location verification, both at initial placement and at regular intervals to confirm that proper tube placement is maintained. Feeding into the stomach is the preferred approach to

--- page 288 ---

enterally delivered feeds but may be affected by other factors including risk of gastric reflux and pulmonary aspiration in critically ill children. ${ }^{4,24}$

Findings from a recent study of mechanically ventilated critically ill children suggest that intermittent gastric feedings are well tolerated in comparison with continuous gastric feedings. Target energy and volume intake were safely attained within 18 hours of feeding initiation in the intermittently fed group and slightly earlier than children receiving continuous gastric feedings. ${ }^{24}$

Postpyloric/transpyloric feedings may be more appropriate when there is evidence of delayed gastric emptying or concern for pulmonary aspiration as judged by the clinical team. Limitations of post/transpyloric feeding include accurate placement of the postpyloric/transpyloric feeding tube (ideally in the distal duodenum or jejunum) and time to tube placement (which may delay initiation of enteral feeds). Numerous methods exist for successful post/transpyloric placement, but they require trained personnel and often necessitate patient transport to radiology for use of fluoroscopy to facilitate tube placement. Electromagnetic devices and ultrasonography are increasingly more useful to facilitate placement of post/transpyloric feeding tubes.

Postpyloric/transpyloric feeds must be administered continuously because the duodenum and jejunum are not anatomically designed as a reservoir. Monitoring for symptoms of "dumping syndrome" with occurrence of hypoglycemia as feeds are initiated is important. Once EN is initiated, many patients also require initiation of a bowel regimen to facilitate regular bowel movements. Considerations for EN in hemodynamically unstable children who are treated with vasoactive medications include type of medication, dose, and evidence of GI tract dysfunction. Patients requiring vasoactive medications may benefit from EN because it may play a protective role by stimulating blood flow, enhancing gastric emptying, and decreasing risk of bacterial translocation. ${ }^{25,26}$

Monitoring tolerance of EN is vital for a successful approach to using EN in critical illness. No specific global definition exists for EN

intolerance. Symptoms of EN intolerance requiring investigation and resolution are listed in Table 11-2 and include the following ${ }^{27}$ :

- Emesis
- Abdominal distension and pain
- High gastric residual volumes
- Diarrhea/constipation

Accessed November 2, 2022. https://www.chop.edu/clinical-pathway/nutrition-picu-pcu-initiation-and-advancement-clinical-pathway

Use of a systematized feeding algorithm/guideline/pathway can help facilitate an organized approach to the initiation and advance of EN. Such an approach is associated with increased EN delivery, decreased EN interruption, and improved patient feeding tolerance. ${ }^{4,28-30}$

- Example of feeding guideline focused on provision of $\mathrm{EN}^{27}$ :
https://www.chop.edu/clinical-pathway/nutrition-picu-pcu-initiation-and-advancement-clinical-pathway

Parenteral nutrition (PN) is not recommended as the major source of nutrient intake in the initial 24 hours of critical illness/admission. However, PN may be necessary in the following circumstances:

- EN is contraindicated (eg, abdominal operation, trauma).
- Anticipated delay for initiation of EN beyond 3-5 days.
- Supplementation of EN with PN is necessary to meet all metabolic needs.
- Timing and route of PN initiation depends on the patient's clinical status:
- Consider at day 3 if moderate to severe malnutrition is present.
- Consider at day $4-5$ for patients in whom enteral feeds are unable to advance to meet minimum nutrition needs.

--- page 293 ---

- Recommend PN via a central venous catheter to optimize nutrition composition in solution. ${ }^{27}$


# Special Considerations 

## Postsurgical Nutrition

Poor nutrition status is associated with suboptimal postsurgical outcomes. ${ }^{25,31}$ Surgical intervention subjects the child to physiologic stress, organ function disruption, and transient or prolonged alteration in energy requirements. It is therefore imperative that the nutrition assessment and preparation for surgery occur as early as possible in the course of illness. It is necessary to identify and correct derangements and optimize the child's clinical status prior to surgical intervention. Considerations for the child undergoing surgical intervention include the use of the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery guidelines to limit surgical stress and enhance treatment and therapies supportive of nutrition therapy ${ }^{25}$ :

- Preoperative oral or enteral feeds for as long as possible
- Intraoperative modified use of opiates and increased use of regional anesthesia to promote the early resumption of oral or enteral feeds.
- Postoperative early reintroduction of oral or enteral feeds to mitigate catabolism following surgery
- Use of a bowel regimen as appropriate


## Burns

Thermal injuries are characterized by hypermetabolic and hypercatabolic states associated with dramatic losses in lean body mass especially in children. ${ }^{32}$ There is an acute increase in energy expenditure and protein metabolism in the early phase following burn injury with negative protein balance that persists as long as 9 months after the initial injury. Early nutrition initiation within 24-48 hours of the burn injury is paramount to counter the catabolic state. EN is the preferred mode of nutrition therapy and can be delivered continuously and safely without interruptions even during intraoperative periods for skin debridement and grafting. PN

--- page 294 ---

should be used if EN is not tolerated or is inadequate to meet energy and protein needs.

Hyperglycemia is common and may require administration of insulin infusions to maintain an optimal strategy of glycemic control to minimize complications. Typically, energy needs often exceed $1.5 \times$ basal metabolic rate and protein needs usually exceed $2.5 \mathrm{gm} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}^{32}$ (see Table 11-3). Children with major burns should receive the following vitamin supplementation ${ }^{33}$ :

- Vitamin A: 5000-10,000 U daily
- Vitamin C: $250-500 \mathrm{mg}$ twice daily
- Zinc: $100-220 \mathrm{mg}$ daily
- Multivitamin supplementation

In situations with resistant hypercatabolism, pharmacologic adjuncts such as recombinant growth hormone, beta-blockers, and anabolic steroids may be used.

## Extracorporeal Life Support

--- page 295 ---

Children supported with extracorporeal life support and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) experience variable total energy expenditure (TEE). Contrary to belief that ECMO is a hypermetabolic state with increased TEE, many children are either hypometabolic (33\%) or experience normal metabolism ( $30 \%$ ). ${ }^{34}$ An individualized approach to prescription and delivery of nutrition is desirable.

Measurement of TEE is challenging because IC cannot be easily used with ECMO. Predictive energy equations are often imprecise in this setting. Alternative methods such as respiratory mass spectroscopy, bioelectricalimpedance analysis, and dilution techniques with isotopes have been explored to assess energy expenditure but are not widely validated. ${ }^{35}$ Current guidelines lack consensus on energy and protein requirements in children supported on ECMO. In general, ASPEN guidelines for nutritiontherapy in critically ill children are extrapolated to this setting because most children on ECMO are supported with invasive mechanical ventilation and/or vasoactive agents.

The impact of ECMO on micronutrients is unclear. Circuit losses of essential amino acids (EAAs), such as isoleucine, and other nutrients, such as calcium, vitamin A, and vitamin E, are common. ECMO patients requiring continuous renal replacement therapy experience micronutrient losses such as vitamins $\mathrm{B}_{1}, \mathrm{~B}_{6}, \mathrm{~B}_{9}, \mathrm{C}$, and trace elements (especially selenium). EN should be initiated within 24-48 hours of ECMO therapy initiation and often requires PN for supplementation of energy and nutrient needs because of numerous barriers to EN initiation and advancement. Barriers include

- challenges with device insertion for delivery of EN,
- contraindications such as ongoing resuscitation,
- severe hemorrhage with suspected or proven GI ischemia, and
- feeding intolerance.

The use of a center- or facility-specific feeding/nutrition guideline in consultation with the RD is highly recommended for nutrition therapy for patients on ECMO. In the absence of standardized guidelines, frequent monitoring of nutrition status and assessment of efficacy of nutrition therapy are essential in pediatric ECMO to optimize metabolism and improve overall outcomes. Each center should establish its own

--- page 296 ---

guidelines and provide recommendations to closely follow these patients, including the use of alternative measurements, such as MUAC, because of difficulties with obtaining weights in these patients.

# Nutrition Therapy for Pressure Injury and Wound Management 

Macro- and micronutrient intake is necessary to maintain skin integrity to protect against foreign microbes and noxious substances and prevent pressure injury (PI). PI is defined as localized damage to the skin and underlying soft tissue. In critically ill children, the incidence of PI ranges between $10 \%$ and $27 \%$ and can be as high as $43 \%$. A multidisciplinary comprehensive approach to care involving physicians, surgeons, nurses specializing in wound care, and the RD is ideal to address PI and wound management in critically ill children. ${ }^{36,37}$

PIs are staged according to severity, with a scale of 1-4, with 4 being the most severe and having the greatest protein needs. PIs occur because of intense and/or prolonged pressure with or without shearing of the skin:

- Often over a bony prominence
- May be related to medical or other necessary devices

Malnourished children-both underweight and overweight or with obesity-are at increased risk of PI, particularly during critical illness. Adequate energy delivery is needed to attain and maintain positive balance to support protein use for collagen and nitrogen synthesis. Protein requirements in critically ill children are increased compared with healthy states. When PI or wounds are present, protein intake will need to exceed the current ASPEN/SCCM minimum recommendation of 1.5 $\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ during critical illness to support positive nitrogen balance and anabolism. ${ }^{4}$

Comorbidities affecting protein metabolism and use such as acute kidney injury and other organ dysfunction must be taken into consideration. Fluid requirements may need to be increased if surface areas of wounds are large and there is a moderate-large degree of insensible losses from wound drainage. ${ }^{38}$

--- page 297 ---

Micronutrients for management of PI and wounds ${ }^{36}$ (Table 11-4) include the following:

- Zinc-a mineral: Vital role in wound healing, cell division, immune function, and synthesis of DNA and RNA
- Vitamin C-an antioxidant: Key role in fatty acid transport, collagen synthesis, neurotransmitter synthesis, prostaglandin metabolism, and nitric oxide synthesis; poor wound healing may indicate deficiency
- Vitamin A-an antioxidant: Role in collagen synthesis, gene transcription, and cell and tissue differentiation; deficiency may impair wound healing
- Iron-a mineral: Essential for skin health; necessary for collagen synthesis, red blood cell production; risk for iron deficiency anemia, with transition from iron-fortified formula to cow's milk
- Arginine-EAA: Role in collagen synthesis and immune modulation that may contribute to wound healing

## Cystic Fibrosis

Anam Bashir, MD<br>Praveen S. Goday, MBBS

## Introduction

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multisystem genetic disease caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. CFTR encodes the CFTR protein. Dysfunction of this protein leads to impaired transport of sodium and chloride across the epithelium and cell membranes. This leads to abnormally thick mucus, which causes impairment in functioning of organs such as the lungs, pancreas, liver, gallbladder, and intestines. ${ }^{1}$

Patients with a CF diagnosis are at risk of malnutrition secondary to increased metabolic demand, pancreatic insufficiency, chronic infections, pulmonary exacerbations, and feeding disorders. ${ }^{1,2}$ Optimal nutrition status is strongly correlated with pulmonary function and survival. To prevent malnutrition in these patients, it is important to screen these patients for malnutrition and include a diet that is high in energy, fat, and protein to meet the increased energy demands if needed. Treatment also includes pancreatic enzyme supplementation and supplementation of vitamins and micronutrients. ${ }^{1}$

## Assessment and Nutrient Requirements

--- page 303 ---

# Frequency of Assessments 

Infants should be assessed monthly until they are 1 year of age and then every 3 months. Children can be assessed more frequently if they are malnourished. ${ }^{2}$

## History, Physical Examination, and Assessment

A careful history review, examination, and evaluation are critical for all patients with cystic fibrosis to ensure appropriate nutrient provision.

- History: 24-hour dietary recall, assessment of appetite, feeding problems (picky eating, family mealtimes), assessment of malabsorption (stool frequency and consistency), adherence to pancreatic enzymatic replacement therapy, and intake of fat-soluble vitamins
- Nutrition-focused physical exam
- Anthropometric assessment: Weight for age, head circumference (up to 2 years of age) length/height, weight for length, body mass index [BMI]) and assessing muscle mass by assessing lean BMI.
- Laboratory and imaging: Annual assessment of fecal elastase ${ }^{1}$; bone mineral density examination by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, which should be assessed after 810 years of age ${ }^{3}$; and fat-soluble vitamin and iron studies annually. ${ }^{1,2}$


## Goals

The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation recommends weight for length higher than the 75 th percentile for age by 2 years of age (World Health Organization growth charts) and BMI greater than or equal to the 50th percentile for age for children more than 2 years of age (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts). ${ }^{1}$

## Implementation of Nutrition Plan and Monitoring

## Nutrition

Traditionally, a well-balanced, high-energy, high-protein, high-fat diet has been encouraged in patients with CF. With the advent of CFTRmodulator therapy, patients have demonstrated decreased energy

--- page 304 ---

expenditure. Thus, patient will need an individualized plan to meet their nutrition needs. ${ }^{3}$

# Increasing Energy Provision 

Increasing fat additives, frequency of meals and snacks, and increasing calories in general through energy-dense foods is recommended if the patient's weight for length or BMI are not meeting goals. ${ }^{1}$ Appetite stimulants can be used if decreased oral intake is the underlying barrier. Enteral nutrition (EN) can be implemented, if patient fails to meet goals despite high-energy foods, addressing mealtime behaviors, and treatment of malabsorption. The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation recommends using nocturnal enteral tube feeding and encouraging oral intake throughout the day. ${ }^{1}$ For infants, human milk or infant formula is recommended. Fortification of breast milk or infant formula can be implemented if there is slow weight gain. ${ }^{1}$ During solid food introduction, pureed meats are recommended early because of their higher content of protein, zinc, and iron. Early introduction of eggs and nuts is helpful as well. ${ }^{1}$ Barriers to achieve optimal nutrition including small bowel bacterial overgrowth, gastroesophageal reflux disease, constipation, and CF-related liver disease and should be addressed. Evaluation of CF-related diabetes (CFRD) should be considered. Undiagnosed CFRD can contribute to poor weight gain, faltering linear growth, and decreased pulmonary function.

## Essential Fatty Acids

Foods high in linolenic acid and monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats should be encouraged. Children with CF are at risk of essential fatty acid (EFA) deficiency due to pancreatic insufficiency. Dietary sources like vegetable oils and cold-water fish are rich sources of essential fatty acids. EFA deficiency can be assessed by triene/tetraene ratio if there are concerns for deficiency. ${ }^{1}$

## Sodium Supplementation

--- page 305 ---

Salt supplementation is recommended because of high sodium losses. Infants should be supplemented with $1 / 8$ teaspoon of salt until 6 months of age and $1 / 4$ teaspoon from 6 to 12 months of age. After 1 year of age, a high-salt diet should be encouraged.

In warm environments or during exercise, salted sports drinks or adding $1 / 8$ teaspoon to 12 oz of sports drink should be used to combat sodium losses. ${ }^{2}$

# Vitamin Supplementation 

Patients with CF are at risk of fat-soluble vitamin deficiency because of fat malabsorption. Vitamin supplementation should be guided by actual laboratory values rather than the patient's age (Table 12-1). ${ }^{4}$

--- page 306 ---

TABLE 12-1. Vitamin Supplementation in Children With Cystic Fibrosis

| Vitamin | Intake | Monitoring |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Vitamin A | - 0-12 mo: <br> 1500 IU <br> - 1-3 y: <br> 5000 IU <br> - 4- <br> 8 y: 5000- <br> 10,000 IU <br> - 8 y and <br> older: 10, <br> 000 IU | - Annual retinol levels <br> - Patients with malnutrition and liver disease due to falsely low vitamin A molar ratio of retinol to RBP <br> - Goal: serum retinol $20 \mu \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$, ratio of retinol to RBP $<0.8$ in children with malnutrition and liver disease |
| Vitamin D | - <1 y: 10- <br> $12.5 \mu \mathrm{~g}$ <br> - 1-10 y: <br> $20-25 \mu \mathrm{~g}$ <br> - 10 y and older: 20$50 \mu \mathrm{~g}$ | - Annual screening of serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D <br> - Goal: $>30 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{mL}$ |
| Vitamin E | - 0-12 mo: <br> 40-50 IU <br> - 1-3 y: 80- <br> 150 IU <br> - 4-8 y: <br> 100-120 <br> IU <br> - 8 y and older: <br> 200-400 <br> IU | - Annual screening of $\alpha$-tocopherol levels, $\alpha$ tocopherol/cholesterol ratio, and $\alpha$-tocopherol/total lipid ratio is preferred because patients have low lipids and $\alpha$-tocopherol might not be accurate <br> - Goal: $\alpha$-tocopherol level $>0.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}, \alpha$-tocopherol/total lipid ratio $>0.8 \mathrm{mg}$ |

https://doi.org/10.1002/ncp. 10899

# Zinc Supplementation 

Fat malabsorption can also cause zinc deficiency. The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation recommends zinc supplementation for 6 months (dose of 1 mg elemental zinc $/ \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ ) in infants and children with poor growth. ${ }^{2}$

## Pancreatic Enzyme Supplementation

In cases of severe CF mutations identified by newborn screening, pancreatic enzyme supplements can be started even without confirmation of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.

Currently, FDA-approved preparations are enteric coated to prevent damage from gastric acid degradation (Creon, Abbvie, Inc.; Pancreaze, Vivus Inc; Zenpep, Nestlé Health Science; Pertzye, Digestive Care, Inc). Pertyze is bicarbonate buffered, which leads to better release in case the gastric environment is too acidic.

For infants and young children who cannot swallow capsules, capsules can be opened and placed directly into the mouth or mixed with

--- page 308 ---

a small amount of acidic food like apple sauce or prepared baby foods like pears. The food should be soft and not require chewing. Non-enteric-coated tablets like Viokace are typically not recommended first-line intervention for enzyme replacement and should be taken with an acid blocker. The tablets can be crushed into a fine powder and added directly to the formula.

Enzyme-containing cartridges like Relizorb or Alcresta contain only pancreatic lipase and are used with continuous EN. Enzyme dosing is usually based on the weight of the child, or the amount of total fat consumed. Dosing for replacement with enteral formula is usually recommended by the total amount of fat in the diet in the enteral formula (Table 12-2).

## **TABLE 12-2. Dosing of Pancreatic Enzymes**

|  Dosing Type | Dose^{a}  |
| --- | --- |
|  Weight-based | • 500–2500 U of lipase per kilogram of body weight per meal and 250–1250 U of lipase per kilogram of body weight per snack  |
|   | • Infants: 2000–4000 U of lipase is used per 120 mL of human milk or formula  |
|  Fat-based | 500–4000 U of lipase per gram of fat  |

^{a} Total daily dose should not exceed more than 2500 U of lipase per kilogram because of the risk of fibrosing colonopathy.

The challenges in achieving good nutrition status require creative solutions, which will vary in different jurisdictions depending on resources, supports, and team structures. The concerted effort and advocacy of all multidisciplinary feeding team members, families, and school staff is often required to ensure a safe feeding/eating environment for children with NI in all settings.

# Assessment and Nutrient Requirements 

Given that nutrition status has such an impact on health and well-being in children with NI, it is important to evaluate it thoroughly. A comprehensive history of cooccurring conditions that affect nutrition is

--- page 313 ---

required at the beginning of a nutrition assessment. Some considerations are outlined in Table 13-2.

--- page 314 ---

| What does the child eat? | What and how much does the child eat? | Type, quality, and quantity of food consumed |
|  | Is the liquid thickened? | See section on dysphagia in chapter 3, "Clinical Considerations." |
|  | Is the food modified? | - Adjust food texture and consistency to match the child's needs. <br> - Speech therapists, occupational therapists, and dietitians all have a role in this assessment and management. |
|  | Is there a limited dietary repertoire? | - Consider monitoring micronutrient values. <br> - For laboratory monitoring, see Table 13-5. ${ }^{\text {e }}$ |
| When does the child eat? | With the family? | Family mealtime is important whether the child is orally or enterally fed. |
|  | Is the child fed before going to bed? | Timing of meals may need adjustment to decrease reflux symptoms at night. |
| Where does the child eat? | How is the child positioned? | - Feeding team therapists can help to optimize positioning and assess adaptive seating. <br> - The goal is comfortable, upright positioning with support at the hips and trunk for a stable base so that the child can breathe easily and concentrate on oromotor tasks. <br> - Upright feeding is preferred for enteral feeding to encourage participation in meals. |

| Questions | Secondary <br> Questions | Special Considerations |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
|  | Is adapted seating required? | - Observation for all feeding/eating may be an essential safety initiative. |
|  | Are distractions limited for meals? | The child may require mealtime routines, environmental cues, few distractions, and relaxation before meals to foster safe feeding. |
| How does the child eat? | How long does it take? | - Adequate time to eat is important, but prolonged mealtimes (>30 min) can increase aspiration risk and fatigue. <br> - Find the balance between fatigue and the pleasure of eating/being fed. |
|  | Is the aspiration risk increased? | Watch for clinical signs of aspiration including watery eyes, coughing, choking, and congested upper airway noises (gurly sounds during/after feeding). |
|  | Does the child pocket the food in their mouth? | - A speech therapist or occupational therapist can assess and address. <br> - Consider heightening the sensory awareness of the food with changes in taste, texture, and temperature. |
|  | Are special utensils required for others to feed the child or to promote self-feeding? | Feeding team therapists address utensil use, for example, by using the following: <br> - Cutaway cups or angled cups for drinking <br> - Self-feeding aids such as angled spoons for limited wrist mobility or weighted spoons for children with tremors <br> - Scoop plates with the sides built up to help with loading the spoon |

# Tools, Anthropometric Measurements, and Nutrition Targets in Children With NI 

Once the history has been taken and there is a good understanding of a child's intake and needs, the clinical assessment and anthropometric measurements need to be integrated with the history information to develop a nutrition care plan. Table 13-4 addresses these and nutrition targets for children with NI. For more detailed information, see also chapter 1, "Nutrition Screening and History."

# Identifying Undernutrition in Children With NI 

The goal of all the detailed history, the clinical evaluations, and anthropometric measures is to identify the risk factors that may lead to undernutrition. The exact measures needed to define malnutrition in children with NI are not yet defined, but several historical factors,

--- page 322 ---

nutrition indicators, and clinical signs are important. They are outlined in Table 13-5.

## Implementation of Nutrition Plan and Monitoring

## Designing Diet Plans for Children With NI

Many of the considerations required in developing appropriate diet plans for children with NI are imbedded in the information gleaned from the

--- page 323 ---

nutrition assessment, the nutrition targets for children with NI, and the red flags for malnutrition.

Oral nutrition rehabilitation involves increasing a child's caloric and nutrient intake and improving the feeding/eating process itself. See the references and Table 13-6 for considerations to optimize oral feeding. ${ }^{5,6}$ Similarly, enteral nutrition (EN) also requires the optimization of nutrient intake; however, the challenges experienced by oral feeding are replaced by problems related to skin management, enteral access devices, and feeding tolerance. Families often experience decisional uncertainty regarding gastrostomy tube (GT) placement; however, they have high satisfaction rates once the GTs are in place. Children generally have improved nutrition indicators and better health with the initiation of EN. ${ }^{7}$

## Diabetes Mellitus

## Introduction

In both type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), a variety of genetic, environmental, and other factors result in the progressive loss of beta-cell function, which results in hyperglycemia; however, the first line of treatment and treatment modalities may differ.

## Types of Diabetes

T1DM is an autoimmune disease that results in a complete loss of betacell function, which results in elevated glucose levels and requires the administration of insulin for food consumption and maintenance of euglycemia. T2DM is a disease that results from insulin resistance due to declining beta-cell function, which is exacerbated by puberty and obesity in children. The progression in decline of $\beta$-cell function is much more rapid in youth with T2DM than T1DM or adults with T2DM, which is associated with higher risks for comorbidities than children with T1DM ${ }^{1}$. Symptoms of diabetes include polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, dehydration, weight loss, electrolyte disturbances, vision changes, fatigue, acetone-smelling breath, and vomiting ${ }^{2}$. The onset of these symptoms is much more rapid in the T1DM population, occurring over

--- page 328 ---

weeks or months, whereas in patients with T2DM, it may develop over months or years.

# Hemoglobin A1c and Goal Blood Glucose Ranges Based on Age 

The hemoglobin A1c test is an indirect measure of a 90-day average glycemic control of an individual and may be influenced by other factors, such as blood cell turnover. ${ }^{2-3}$ Refer to Tables 14-1 and 14-2.

${ }^{\mathrm{b}} \mathrm{HbA1c}$ targets should be set in accordance with guidelines and consideration of individual and family factors. It may adjust to a higher goal based on many individual factors, such as toddlers or children who cannot articulate symptoms of hypoglycemia ( $<7.5 \%$ ) and those who have frequent severe hypoglycemia ( $<8 \%$ ). Additionally, it may be lowered ( $<6.5 \%$ ) if a patient can reach the goal without significant hypoglycemia, a significant burden on the child and/or family from the intensity of the regimen.

# Assessment and Nutrient Requirements 

In children with T1DM and T2DM, calorie needs are typically calculated on initial diagnosis. Few studies have assessed whether the caloric needs of children or adolescents with diabetes differ from the general population; thus, it is recommended to use the dietary reference intake (DRI) incorporating the individual's growth patterns, food history, physical activity, and nutrition-related laboratories. ${ }^{5,6}$

For children who are overweight and obese, attaining a body mass index (BMI) below the 85th percentile can help increase insulin sensitivity and decrease the risk for comorbidities. It should be noted that obesity rates in children with T1DM are the same as those of the general population. ${ }^{7}$ Refer to chapter 25, "Weight Management and Obesity," for estimating calorie needs for the overweight/obese population.

Carbohydrate intake should be equivalent to the acceptable macronutrient distribution range of $45 \%-65 \%$ of estimated caloric needs being divided between meals and snacks. "Low-carb" diet is not well defined throughout the literature, making it more challenging to study, and is not well studied in pediatrics ${ }^{6}$; thus, it is not recommended. A minimum of 130 g of carbohydrates per day is recommended and 14 g

--- page 330 ---

dietary fiber per 1000 kcal . ${ }^{8,9}$ Emphasis should be placed on increasing intake of complex carbohydrate foods and limiting foods high in added sugars, particularly sugar-sweetened beverages. Education should be provided regarding the quality of the fat source ${ }^{10}$ and avoidance of overconsuming fat products to decrease consumption of carbohydrates. ${ }^{4,8,11}$

Protein, fat, and fluid needs do not differ from the average pediatric population, and the DRI is recommended unless otherwise indicated. ${ }^{10}$ Refer to chapter 16, "Dislipidemia" for the distribution of fats from the diet.

# Implementation of Nutrition Plan and Monitoring 

## Assess for Food Insecurity and Social Determinants of Health

These will impact nutrition education and/or delivery of information, including how to overcome these barriers, should they exist.

- Use the Hunger Vital Signs tool, which is validated in the pediatric population. ${ }^{12}$
- Refer to social worker or case manager for assistance and/or resources.


## Nutrition Support

Use the age-appropriate formula as indicated by the patient's other medical conditions because a "diabetic" formula is not necessarily indicated. ${ }^{13}$ Subcutaneous insulin injections may be used to match the feeding regimen. ${ }^{14}$ In acute states, patients may have increased insulin resistance ${ }^{13}$ and may require working with the endocrinologist on adjusting insulin regimen.

## Education

Education should be provided on the following topics.

## Nutrition

--- page 331 ---

A patient's medication regimen, literacy, and numeracy levels, as well as respect for cultural preferences, will affect the educational approach taken by the practitioner. Refer to Table 14-3 for details regarding educational approaches.

--- page 332 ---

# TABLE 14-3. Education Approaches for Mealtime Management for Children With Diabetes 

| Approach and Description | Benefits | Limitations |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Carbohydrate counting: A method of determining carbohydrate containing foods and estimating the total grams of carbohydrates consumed to dose insulin. An ICR is individualized and determined by an endocrinologist or CDCES. Determining to round to half or whole units is typically determined by the diabetes care team. ICR $=X$ unit(s) of insulin for every $X g$ carbohydrate consumed. For example, Sandy is going to eat 60 g of carbohydrates and uses an ICR of 1 U of insulin for every 5 g of carbs she eats. $60 \div 5=12 \mathrm{U}$ of fastacting insulin. | - Improved accuracy compared with other methods <br> - Greater freedom of portion control and customization of insulin therapy <br> - Preferred method for diabetes management | - Literacy and numeracy can be potential barriers <br> - Precise carbohydrate counting may be overwhelming for some individuals <br> - Potential for hyperfixation on and avoidance of carbohydrates in the diet |
| Diabetic exchanges: A method in which portions of foods with 15 g carbohydrates are interchangeable from starch, fruit, and milk products. The patient is instructed to consistently consume a certain number of "exchanges" each meal or snack. The provider determines the ICR and instructs the patient to give a set dose of insulin to reduce the mathematical burden on the patient or family. For example, Sandy is allowed 4 exchanges ( 60 g carb) per meal to be covered with 6 U of fast-acting insulin. (This is the same as using ICR 1:10.) | - Involves less math/fewer calculations than carbohydrate counting while still being suitable for people on an ICR <br> - Possibility of set dosing of insulin for meals | - Literacy and numeracy in very low education levels <br> - Less precise than carbohydrate counting, therefore, greater potential for inaccuracy |

| Approach and Description | Benefits | Limitations |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| MyPlate plan: The MyPlate method can help families create balanced meals by making one-half of their plate non starchy vegetables, one-quarter lean proteins, and one-quarter carbohydrates, in addition to a serving of milk and fruit. Not appropriate for calculating insulin dosing for T1DM population. | - Ease of use, especially with ethnic and cultural foods <br> - Promotion of balanced eating and portion control of all food groups <br> - Appropriate for very low literacy and numeracy | - Not appropriate for individuals using an ICR <br> - Some cultures use bowls or other flatware/utensils, making this method nonapplicable |
| Traffic light plan: Foods are assigned a color on a stoplight based on nutritional and caloric density to encourage children and families to be mindful of their food choices and reduce the frequency of consumption of high-calorie, sugary, salty, and fatty foods. Not appropriate for calculating insulin dosing for T1DM population. | - Ease of use <br> - Promotes principles of mindful eating and choosing nutrientdense foods | - Some individuals may have trouble categorizing foods without assistance <br> - Requires some literacy |

Abbreviations: CDCES, Certified Diabetes Care and Education Specialist; ICR, insulin/carbohydrate ratio; T1DM, type 1 diabetes mellitus.

# Portion control involves the following: 

- Using measuring cups and/or food scales during meal prep and when serving food.
- Reading nutrition facts labels for serving size, servings per container, and total grams of carbohydrates.

It is important to consider the difference between simple verses complex carbohydrates that contain fiber. Also consider the impact of protein and fat on postprandial glucose rises. Sugar alcohols (polyols) are not fully absorbed from the small intestine into the blood and therefore have a lower impact on glucose levels than other sources of

--- page 336 ---

carbohydrates; they may cause a laxative effect if consumed in large amounts ( $>20 \mathrm{~g}$ ), especially in children. ${ }^{15}$

For insulin dosing of foods that contain high fiber ( $>5 \mathrm{~g}$ ) or sugar alcohols ( $>5 \mathrm{~g}$ ), subtract half the fiber and/or sugar alcohols from total carbohydrates and dose for the remainder. ${ }^{16}$ Dosing rules should be further discussed with the dietitian and physician on follow-up visits. Encourage limiting "snacking" between meals, even if carb free, to prevent excessive weight gain.

# Medications 

For those on mealtime insulin, it is important to educate on dosing rapid or fast-acting insulin $10-15$ minutes before the meal to prevent significant glucose rises postprandially. In certain circumstances (eg, toddlers or picky eaters), midmeal dosing may be appropriate and should be discussed with the diabetes team. Refer to Table 14-5 for details regarding the types of insulin.

# Exercise 

For children and adolescents, encourage 30-60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous-intensity exercise daily in addition to strength and bone strengthening training at least 3 days per week. Limit non-academic screen time to 2 hours per day. ${ }^{17}$

For adults ( $>18 \mathrm{y}$ ), encourage 150 minutes or more of moderate-to-vigorous-intensity exercise per week, with no more than 2 days in succession without activity. In younger, healthy individuals, shorter durations of high intensity or interval training of $\geq 75$ minutes is

--- page 340 ---

acceptable. Moderate-to-intense exercise should be delayed if glucose levels are $\geq 350 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}[19.4 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}]$ ) and/or the child has moderate-tohigh urine ketones. ${ }^{17}$

A plan should be customized to promote euglycemia during exercise. For those on insulin, consumption of a carbohydrate- and proteincontaining snack before or during activity can prevent hypoglycemia with physical activity. ${ }^{18}$ In children with T2DM on oral medications, the risk for exercise-induced hypoglycemia is rare.

Weight Management. For children and adolescents 18 y , weight loss of $7 \%-10 \%$ body weight is suggested if BMI $\geq 85$ th percentile, however there is conflicting evidence to support this. ${ }^{4}$ For adults $\geq 18 \mathrm{y}$, supporting weight loss of $15 \%$ is recommended. ${ }^{4}$

# Nutrition Monitoring and Recommendations

# Disordered Eating 

Mary Pat Turon-Findley, Med, RD, CMHIMP, LD

## Introduction

Disordered eating and eating disorders are often underdiagnosed disease states that affect many youths, adolescents, and young adults. Because of the secrecy and many of the signs and symptoms of disordered eating or an eating disorder, it may be difficult to identify; many cases go undetected and underdiagnosed. Although sources differ greatly, it is estimated that 30 million individuals are battling eating disorders in the United States, many of which have comorbidities with mental health illnesses. ${ }^{1}$

This chapter reviews the classification, diagnosis, assessment, general etiology, therapy and treatment strategies, and interdisciplinary teamwork and monitoring, including reviewing for refeeding syndrome and planning for a continuum of care.

## Classification and Diagnosis of Disordered Eating

The American Psychiatric Association recommends using a multiaxial system in the assessment and diagnosis of mental disorders and lists subcategories under "Feeding Disorders" in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (Table 15-1). ${ }^{1-4}$ These may be associated comorbid mental health illnesses. ${ }^{2,4,5}$

--- page 346 ---

TABLE 15-1. Eating Disorder and Feeding Disorder Summary (DSM-5)

| Anorexia nervosa | - Restriction of energy intake or requirements leading to significantly low body weight for age, sex, development trajectory or physical health <br> - Intense fear of weight gains and disturbances in one's body perceptions or false self-evaluations <br> - May have comorbid obsessive-compulsive disorder, which can be seen with other mental disorders <br> - Types: restricting type (during last 3 mo ) and binge eating/purge type (during the last 3 mo ) <br> - Ranges of mild, moderate, severe, and extreme are dependent on BMI values |
| :--: | :--: |
| Bulimia nervosa | - Recurrent episodes of binge eating over a discrete period of time and a sense of lack-of-control overeating during the episode, which is done to prevent weight gain with use of compensatory behaviors such as self-induced vomiting, misuse of laxatives, diuretics/other medications, fasting, or excessive exercise <br> - May have restriction type, which can be seen with other mental disorders <br> - Behaviors occur at least weekly for 3 mo; dysmorphic body image <br> - Ranges of mild, moderate, severe, and extreme based on episodes of compensatory behaviors per week |
| Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder | - An eating or feeding disturbance with significant weight loss or failure to achieve expected growth <br> - May have low interest in eating or food; avoidance secondary to sensory issues or reality-altered thoughts on consequences of eating <br> - May have had choking or swallowing trauma <br> - Avoidant because of fear-based phobia, pain, extreme pickiness, forgetfulness, or aversion to textures <br> - Sometimes seen with medications or other disorders (eg, autism) |
| Rumination disorder | - Repeated regurgitation or chewing and spitting foods over a period of at least 1 mo <br> - Symptoms may occur in context of another mental disorder or in addition to other eating disorder categories <br> - Symptoms are not a result of another medical condition |
| Binge eating disorder | - Recurrent episodes of binge eating over a discrete period of time of amounts larger than what most people consume |

--- page 347 ---

|  | during that period, and a sense of lack of control <br> - Eating is more rapid than normal, feeling uncomfortably full, <br> eating large amounts, feelings of embarrassment, <br> loneliness, and guilt/disgust/self-loathing with one's self <br> - Sometimes associated with food addictions <br> - Ranges of mild, moderate, severe, and extreme dependent <br> on binge eating episodes per week |
| :-- | :-- |
| Other specified <br> feeding or eating <br> disorder | Applies to presentations associated with distress or impairment <br> in social, occupational, or other important areas of function over <br> the following designations: atypical anorexia nervosa; bulimia <br> nervosa (low frequency or limited duration); binge eating <br> disorder (low frequency or limited duration); purging disorder; <br> and night eating syndrome |
| Unspecified <br> feeding or eating <br> disorders | May present as an eating disorder owing to a variety of clinical <br> distress or impairments of important functional areas in which <br> the patient does not meet full criteria |

Abbreviations: BMI, body mass index; DSM-5, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition.

# Assessment and Nutrient Requirements 

Establishing trust and rapport is vital to proper assessment and successful treatment with a nonjudgmental approach in interviewing. It is recommended to speak in low tones and calmly, maintain a nonthreatening posture, avoid surprise or showing disappointment, speak firmly but with empathy, gauge eye contact to match the patient, monitor nonverbal cues and body posture of the patient, ask open-ended questions, and allow time to respond because cognition can change or slow with malnutrition and starvation. ${ }^{1,2,6}$

During the assessment process, the clinical practitioner should assess for signs and symptoms of malnutrition along with a thorough nutritionfocused physical examination (NFPE; Table 15-2). Additional information should be gathered on weight and development of not only the patient but also the history of the family, if available, to include in the assessment and treatment. ${ }^{1}$ It should be noted that most often patients with anorexia will have normal test results for albumin levels.

## Macronutrient Requirements

For patients with anorexia nervosa, estimated energy requirements are $30-40 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{kg}$ of current body weight; with thermogenesis this may increase to $80-100 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d} .{ }^{1}$ For patients with bulimia nervosa or a

--- page 349 ---

binge eating disorder, energy requirements for weight maintenance are around $1.2-1.3 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{kg}$ per resting energy expenditure. ${ }^{1}$ Protein requirements are the same as the recommended dietary allowance and are calculated based on ideal body weight (IBW), and fat should make up $25 \%-30 \%$ of calories. ${ }^{1}$

Disordered eating is a complex process, and it is important that any protocol is adjusted based on patient factors including the patient's medical condition, cardiac and laboratory status, or probability of refeeding and prior intake. ${ }^{7-9}$ The following protocol is recommended unless your hospital policy/program dictates otherwise.

The laboratory assessment at presentation includes the following:

- Complete blood cell count
- Electrolytes, including magnesium, phosphorus, and calcium
- Glucose
- Zinc
- Ferritin, iron-binding capacity, and iron saturation
- 25-hydroxy vitamin D
- Thiamin


## Nutrition Support Plan

When developing the nutrition support plan, the IBW should be used (estimated 50th percentile for age/sex with consideration for height). The estimated IBW may need to be adjusted during treatment. ${ }^{4-7}$ Goals for weight gain depend on program or hospital policy and the medical status of the patient (while managing refeeding syndrome if present). Most sources support a goal of $0.5-1.0 \mathrm{lb} / \mathrm{wk}$ for weight gain. ${ }^{1,3,4}$

Recommendations for initiation and advancement of nutrition support in patients with disordered eating are outlined in Table 15-3. Energy provision should start at $20-40 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ of current body weight initially with an advance of 200 cal every other day if tolerated. Some resources suggest starting as low as $5 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ in extremely high-risk cases.

Clinical professionals should assess patients and advance energy intake goals based on refeeding risk. ${ }^{9}$

Forthcoming 2024.

Protein provision should be $0.8-1.5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg}$ or $15 \%-20 \%$ of total calories from high biologic value source; this will need to be monitored and reassessed carefully. Fat provision should be $25 \%-30 \%$ of total calories with choices of appropriate sources of essential fatty acids as well as healthy fat selections; this may be a trigger for patients, and support should be offered for positive health recovery and outcomes. ${ }^{6}$

Fluids are critical for hydration, and orthostatic pulse and blood pressure need to be monitored from lying, sitting, and standing per hospital or program policy. All patients should have intakes and outputs closely monitored. ${ }^{6}$

The clinical professional should take daily opportunities to reassess health and medical status using orthostatic fluid and cardiac measurements and using NFPE assessment for edema, swelling, capillary refill, pitting of skin, skin quality and integrity, as well as thinking errors and cognition. ${ }^{1,6,10}$

Micronutrient deficiencies often occur in patients with disordered eating, especially in the setting of restrictive eating. Common deficiencies include zinc, B vitamins (especially thiamin), ${ }^{9}$ and vitamin D. Most patients will benefit from the initial multivitamin with a mineral supplement. Obtain initial laboratory value markers upon admission. Reassessment of laboratory values per program or policy, or alignment with medical condition of the patient may be necessary. If there is no policy, monitor electrolytes and hydration markers as well as liver profile weekly until the patient is stable in weight gain, intake, and medical status. ${ }^{1,4-6}$

Mealtime should be calm, and clinical professionals should offer patient support and discussion as needed. Times of eating should be limited to about 20-30 minutes per hospital or program policy. Meals and snacks should incorporate a variety of foods and fluids that meet nutrient

--- page 353 ---

needs in addition to stabilization of health. An example nutrition support order set for patients with disordered eating can be found in Exhibit 15-1.

# EXHIBIT 15-1. Nutrition Support Order Set for Patient With Disordered Eating 

- Order 4-6 feedings daily to provide recommended caloric energy, protein, fat, fluids, and nutrients.
- Record calorie count and intake and output.
- Blind weight in morning after void in gown, suggest same scale and same time of day with same type of gown, preferably prior to intake or shower (may water load), and suggest monitoring for any hidden weights or objects.
- Restrict physical activity.
- Monitor laboratory values.
- Monitor orthostatic measures.
- Create behavioral plan on allotted time for eating.
- Recommend a multivitamin with mineral supplement.
- Create a calories and advancement plan.
- Create weight goals for stay, per day, and per week.
- Monitor for bowel sounds/movements.
- Supplement plan for refusal of intake. ${ }^{\text {a,b }}$

${ }^{\text {b }}$ Setnick J. Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Pocket Guide to Eating Disorders. 2nd ed. Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics; 2017.

The interdisciplinary team should be unified and maintain communication throughout the process of treatment and care. ${ }^{1}$ During treatment, close monitoring of the patient is required. Monitoring should include documentation of intake by type and amount, assessment for behaviors like hiding food (possibly in clothing or on person), throwing food away, and excessive physical activity (eg, pacing, exercise in room, exercise in shower, or tensing muscles). The care team should also monitor boundaries with other patients, challenges or triggers, and anxiety. ${ }^{1,6}$

## Enteral Nutrition Support and Route of Feeding

--- page 354 ---

Disordered eating and eating disorders are complex and in treatment, when patient is refusing oral intake, a decision to initiate enteral nutrition is relative to medical status. Use of the nasogastric (NG) route is preferred with relative ease of administration as well as mimicry of usual meal or snack times. In cases in which long-term enteral support is needed, some success is reported with NG tube placement when purging is not an issue. ${ }^{6}$ Parenteral nutrition is only indicated for patients with digestive inability or in severely malnourished patients, but this method does not aid in hunger cues. ${ }^{1,6,7}$

# Refeeding Syndrome 

Re-initiation of carbohydrate-containing feeding of severely malnourished patients may result in refeeding syndrome, in which there are acute intracellular shifts of electrolytes as cell anabolism is stimulated. ${ }^{9,11}$ Refeeding syndrome can affect cardiac, respiratory, hepatic, cognition, neuromuscular, other various complications, and even death. ${ }^{9,11}$ Refeeding may occur when patients over-report intake in instances of starvation and can occur even with initiation of dextrosecontinuing-intravenous fluids. Careful monitoring for refeeding syndrome is required for all at-risk patients. See chapter 6, "Parenteral Nutrition," for a further discussion of refeeding syndrome.

## Summary

Daily monitoring includes multiple factors during the treatment and implementation of the nutrition plan such as observation for food acceptance, appropriate weight gain, fewer compensatory behaviors, stable medical status, normalized laboratory values, appropriate cardiac function and orthostatic measures, and behavioral and therapeutic advances. Imperative to continued success is support for both patient and family, including a stable aftercare plan to ensure continuum of care to monitor the patient's status for nutrition as well as medical and overall mental health.

## Dyslipidemia

Kari Murdy, RD, LD

## Introduction

Dyslipidemia is defined as a disorder of lipoprotein metabolism that leads to 1 or more of the following abnormal findings: elevated total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (HDL-C). ${ }^{1}$ There are 2 forms of dyslipidemia: primary and secondary. Primary dyslipidemias are caused by genetic anomalies, and secondary dyslipidemias are caused by other conditions. ${ }^{2}$ Table 16-1 provides a list of primary and secondary dyslipidemias.

--- page 357 ---

# TABLE 16-1. Types of Dyslipidemia 

| Primary or Genetic <br> Forms | Secondary Causes |
| :--: | :--: |
| - Familial hypercholesterolemia (most common; 1:250 people) <br> - Exogenous hypertriglyceridemia <br> - Familial hypertriglyceridemia <br> - Familial combined hyperlipidemia <br> - Polygenic hypercholesterolemia <br> - Broad $\beta$ disease (dysbetalipoproteinemia) | - Obesity: most common <br> - Endocrine/metabolic: hypothyroidism/hypopituitarism, type 1 and type 2 diabetes, pregnancy, polycystic ovarian syndrome, lipodystrophy, or acute intermittent porphyria <br> - Renal: chronic renal disease, hemolytic uremic syndrome, or nephrotic syndrome <br> - Drug: alcohol, corticosteroids, isotretinoin, $\beta$ blockers, some oral contraceptives, select chemotherapeutic agents, or select antiretroviral agents <br> - Infectious: acute viral/bacterial infection, HIV, or hepatitis <br> - Hepatic: obstructive liver disease/cholestatic conditions, biliary cirrhosis, or Alagille syndrome <br> - Storage disease: glycogen-storage disease, Gaucher disease, cystine-storage disease, juvenile Tay-Sachs disease, or Niemann-Pick disease <br> - Inflammatory disease: systemic lupus erythematosus or juvenile rheumatoid arthritis <br> - Other: Kawasaki disease, anorexia nervosa, after solid organ transplant, childhood cancer survivor, progeria, idiopathic hypercalcemia, Klinefelter syndrome, or Werner syndrome |

The prevalence of dyslipidemia in US children (ages 6-19 years) is about $20 \% .{ }^{3}$ Dyslipidemia is a key risk factor for coronary heart disease and stroke. ${ }^{4}$ Exposure to cardiovascular risk factors early in life has been found to contribute to the development of structural and functional vascular changes related to atherosclerosis. ${ }^{5}$ Because heart disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States, timely and effective treatment of dyslipidemia in the pediatric population is imperative to help prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD) later in life. ${ }^{6,7}$

## Assessment and Nutrient Requirements

--- page 358 ---

Universal lipid screening is recommended between 9 and 11 years of age. ${ }^{5}$ If a nonfasting sample is obtained, calculate the non-HDL-C (TC -HDL-C). If non-HDL-C $\geq 145 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL} \pm \mathrm{HDL}<40 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$, a fasting (nothing to eat or drink for $10-12$ hours) lipid profile via venipuncture two times should be obtained, and the results should be averaged. ${ }^{5}$ Table 16-2 provides lipoprotein reference ranges.

# TABLE 16-2. Lipoprotein Reference Ranges for Children and Adolescents 

| Category | Low <br> (mg/dL) | Acceptable (mg/dL) | Borderline (mg/dL) | High <br> (mg/dL) |
| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| TC | - | $<170$ | $170-199$ | $\geq 200$ |
| LDL-C | - | $<110$ | $110-129$ | $\geq 130$ |
| Non-HDL-C | - | $<120$ | $120-144$ | $\geq 145$ |
| TGs | - | $<75$ | $75-99$ | $\geq 100$ |
|  | - | $<90$ | $90-129$ | $\geq 130$ |
| HDL-C | $<40$ | $>45$ | $40-45$ | - |

Once two reliable fasting lipid profiles are obtained, review the breakdown of the lipid profiles, analyzing the various lipoprotein abnormalities that comprise the TC value. By determining which particular lipoproteins are out of range, specific dietary, lifestyle, and pharmacotherapy recommendations can then be provided (see Table 163).

# Implementation of Nutrition Plan and Monitoring 

## Step 1: History and Education

Obtain a detailed patient dietary history and family history of lipid abnormalities, premature CVD, and weight history; assess physical activity status; and educate/counsel the patient based on the findings.

## Diet

Education regarding a healthy dietary pattern is important, especially for the pediatric population. Focusing on a healthy eating pattern can help prevent patients and their families from feeling overwhelmed with counting grams of food consumption and calculating percentages of daily macronutrient intake. MyPlate is a great place to start. See MyPlate.gov for education materials. At each meal, $1 / 2$ of the plate should be fruits/vegetables, $1 / 4$ should be grains, and $1 / 4$ should be protein; $2-3$ servings of low-fat or fat-free dairy should be consumed daily. When educating a patient with dyslipidemia using the MyPlate method, focus should be on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, lean protein

--- page 362 ---

sources, low-fat or fat-free dairy products, and healthy fat sources as well as limiting processed foods and sugary beverage intake. ${ }^{8}$

# Weight 

If a patient's weight is over or equal to the 85 th percentile, discuss achieving and maintaining a healthy weight. See chapter 25, "Weight Management and Obesity," for more detailed recommendations.

## Physical Activity

Encourage the patient to increase physical activity level with a goal of 1 hour daily of moderate-to-vigorous activity. It helps to brainstorm with the patient the types of aerobic activity that interest them and that they feel they could sustain.

## Step 2: Plan

Review fasting lipid profile laboratory results to determine the abnormal lipoproteins, and provide the patient with more detailed education/counseling on specific dietary recommendations based on the lipid profile makeup. Table 16-4 specifies thorough nutrition recommendations for the various dyslipidemias.

--- page 363 ---

TABLE 16-4. Specific Nutrient Recommendations

| Nutrient | Recommendation | Examples |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Total fat | - $25 \%-35 \%$ of daily calories ${ }^{a}$ <br> - Replace saturated and trans fats with monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats | — |

# Inborn Errors of Metabolism 

Mary Sowa, MS, RD<br>Laura Jaimes, MS, RD, CNSC<br>Sandy Van Calcar, PhD, RD

## Introduction

There are over 750 identified inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) to date, with some presenting at birth and others presenting later in life. ${ }^{1}$ Some IEM can present with symptoms of acute metabolic crisis, whereas others develop clinical manifestations over time. ${ }^{2}$ For most IEM, there is a range of severity that is dictated by the degree of enzyme or cofactor deficiency, resulting in both early and later-onset clinical presentations. ${ }^{3}$ Most IEM are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern wherein both parents are asymptomatic carriers, each passing the genetic variant to their offspring. ${ }^{1}$

Newborn screening (NBS) has transformed the outcomes for infants with IEM by allowing for early diagnosis and management. For NBS, blood is collected on a filter paper card from an infant's heel within 24-48 hours following birth. ${ }^{1}$ NBS laboratory tests use tandem mass spectrometry technology to detect multiple disorders from amino acid and acylcarnitine analysis from dried blood spots. ${ }^{4}$ The Recommended Uniform Screening Panel from the Department of Health and Human Services is a national guideline of core and secondary conditions to include in screening programs. ${ }^{1,5}$

There is a high risk of acute metabolic crises with many IEM and symptoms may be present before NBS results become available. ${ }^{3}$ These events can also occur during subsequent catabolic events such as illness, surgery, injury, and the postpartum period. The increase in energy needs and rapid accumulation of toxic metabolites can lead to life-threatening emergencies. Presentations in a neonate in a metabolic crisis vary with the disorder, but some common signs and symptoms can include failure to thrive, vomiting, lethargy, fluctuating muscle tone, respiratory failure, hepatic dysfunction, cardiac abnormalities, seizures, and/or coma. ${ }^{2,6}$ Presenting laboratory abnormalities can include hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis (high anion gap), ketonemia/ketonuria, lactic acidosis, hyperammonemia, abnormal liver function markers, and/or thrombocytopenia. Metabolic crises need to be managed with a physician trained in the treatment of IEM, and all patients should be provided with an emergency protocol.

In this chapter, we outline the general principles of treatment for the 5 main categories of IEM: aminoacidopathies, urea cycle defects, organic acidemias, fatty acid oxidation disorders,

--- page 368 ---

and disorders of carbohydrate metabolism. The tables provide a list of the most common IEM in each of these categories with general guidelines for chronic treatment.

# Nutrition Therapy Basics 

## Aminoacidopathies

Aminoacidopathies are a group of inherited genetic disorders involved in the metabolism of a specific amino acid(s). With a deficiency in an enzyme in an amino acid metabolic pathway, the offending amino acid, plus the amino acid's associated metabolite(s), accumulate in blood and various tissues. The manifestations of aminoacidopathies vary greatly with each disorder. ${ }^{2}$ For example, in untreated phenylketonuria (PKU) and homocystinuria, signs and symptoms develop gradually over time with prolonged exposure to the offending metabolites (Table 17-1). In contrast, maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) can present acutely prior to diagnosis, and patients remain at risk for metabolic decompensation during any illness or other catabolic event, even with a chronic treatment regimen (Table 17-1).

${ }^{a}$ The disorder is included in NBS: $X X=$ listed as core disorder for screening; $X=$ listed as secondary disorder for screening based on Recommended Uniform Screening Program.
${ }^{\text {b }}$ This IEM can include a medical food (formula) as part of treatment.

# Example: MSUD 

MSUD results from a deficiency of the branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase complex required for catabolism of the branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) leucine, valine and isoleucine, although leucine and its associated ketoacid ( $\alpha$-ketoisocaproic acid) are the primary toxic metabolites. ${ }^{7}$ MSUD is rare in the general population, but a founder variant in the OldOrder Mennonite results in a high incidence of approximately 1 in 350 live births in this population. ${ }^{8}$

## Medical Nutrition Therapy Basics for MSUD

The goal of nutrition management for MSUD is to maintain near-normal leucine concentrations, prevent isoleucine and valine deficiency, and provide sufficient energy intake to allow for normal growth and development. Lifelong diet treatment can result in good cognitive and developmental outcomes, especially if illnesses and other catabolic events are aggressively managed. Especially for those with severe forms of this disorder, liver transplant prevents metabolic crises and allows for diet liberalization. ${ }^{7}$

The nutrition treatment of MSUD includes the following ${ }^{9-11}$ :

1. Provide appropriate calories and fluid for age.
2. Restrict intact protein sources to limit intake of leucine to meet age-appropriate requirements, avoiding excessive or deficient intake (for infants younger than 6 months, leucine tolerance ranges from 40 to $100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ ).
3. Provide a BCAA-free medical food (protein substitute without leucine, valine, and isoleucine [ie, MSUD Anamix Early Years, Nutricia North America]) to minimally meet the age-appropriate dietary reference intake (DRI) for protein.
4. Prevent isoleucine and/or valine deficiency by supplementing these amino acids, as needed.
5. Adjust nutrition plan based on leucine, valine, and isoleucine concentrations in plasma amino acid profiles to meet goal concentrations, listed next.

--- page 371 ---

# Routine Monitoring for MSUD 

Routine monitoring includes plasma amino acids (or BCAAs on dried blood spots) ${ }^{12}$ :

- Treatment goals ${ }^{9,13}$ :
- Leucine: $100-300 \mathrm{umol} / \mathrm{L}(100-200 \mathrm{umol} / \mathrm{L}$ in infants)
- Isoleucine: $100-300 \mathrm{umol} / \mathrm{L}$
- Valine: $200-400 \mathrm{umol} / \mathrm{L}$


## Acute Care for MSUD

During illness or other catabolic events, individuals are likely to require aggressive nutrition support. ${ }^{10,14}$ Promoting protein anabolism is key to reducing leucine concentrations. Check BCAA concentrations in plasma amino acids every 12-24 hours to guide treatment adjustments.

1. Provide optimal nonprotein caloric support.
a. Energy

- Individuals may require 1.5 to more than 2 times the estimated energy expenditure for age from enteral and/or parenteral sources. ${ }^{10}$
b. Dextrose
- Start with $10 \%$ dextrose (D10) intravenous (IV) fluids at an age-appropriate glucose infusion rate (GIR) but consider a higher concentration by central access to meet high caloric needs.
- Insulin may be needed in the presence of hyperglycemia to allow for adequate caloric support. ${ }^{14}$
c. Intralipids
- Initiate age-appropriate dosing with goal of $30 \%-50 \%$ of nonprotein sources from lipid.
d. Fluid
- Avoid excess fluid administration and hypotonic solutions, given the high risk for cerebral edema. Ensure normal serum osmolarity.

2. Initiate a source of BCAA-free amino acids as soon as possible.
a. Hold leucine intake with elimination of intact protein sources until the leucine concentration is $<300 \mu \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$.
b. Initiate BCAA-free medical food by continuous nasogastric (NG) feeding to provide amino acids to promote protein anabolism.

- Goal: $2.0-3.5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg}$ for infants; it is greater than the DRI for all ages. ${ }^{10,14}$
c. Initiate addition of valine and isoleucine solutions $(100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{mL})$ to the medical food to prevent deficiency of these amino acids. The goal concentration is $>400 \mu \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$ in plasma amino acids for both.
d. Consider parenteral BCAA-free specialty amino acid solutions if the patient is unable to tolerate an enteral medical food. (See "Resources" section in this chapter.)

3. When the leucine concentration has decreased ( $<300 \mu \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$ ), reintroduce a source of leucine from a standard enteral formula or expressed breast milk for neonates.
a. Initiate enteral feeds (NG and/or oral) to provide leucine at approximately $25 \%$ of usual leucine tolerance.

- Continue isoleucine and valine supplements to ensure concentrations of both remain above $400 \mu \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$ as leucine is added.
b. Increase leucine intake based on tolerance and plasma leucine concentrations.
c. If enteral feeding is not possible, initiate a standard amino acid parenteral solution to provide leucine needs.

4. Reduce parenteral fluids as enteral feeding increases to maintain adequate caloric intake.

## Disorders of the Urea Cycle

Inborn errors of the urea cycle, called urea cycle disorders (UCDs), are a group of 8 disorders affecting the enzymes or transporters associated with the urea cycle with an overall incidence of 1 in 35,000 births ${ }^{15}$ (Table 17-2). Except in arginase deficiency, the hallmark of UCDs is hyperammonemia, which can be rapidly lethal in those with severe neonatal forms of these disorders. However, milder forms of these disorders can present at any age. ${ }^{16}$ Later-onset symptoms include cognitive delay, neurological/psychiatric symptoms, and chronic liver disease. Only argininosuccinic acid synthetase, argininosuccinic acid lyase, and arginase deficiencies can

--- page 372 ---

be detected by NBS; thus, it is essential to include ammonia in the initial laboratory evaluations of critically ill infants. ${ }^{15,17}$

TABLE 17-2. Urea Cycle Disorders

| Disorder | Enzyme Affected | NBS $^{\mathrm{a}}$ | Biochemical Findings | Clinical Features | Nutrition Modification |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| NAGS deficiency | Nacetylglutamate synthase |  | Hyperammonemia | Lethargy, vomiting, apnea, coma, death if untreated; intellectual disability | Protein restriction ${ }^{b}$ : EAA and arginine supplementation (in conjunction with carglumic acid) |
| OTC deficiency | Ornithine transcarbamylase |  | Hyperammonemia, respiratory alkalosis | Lethargy, vomiting, apnea, coma, death if untreated; intellectual disability | Protein restriction ${ }^{b}$ : EAA and citrulline supplementation (in conjunction with nitrogen scavenging medications) |
| CPS deficiency | Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase |  | Hyperammonemia, respiratory alkalosis | Lethargy, vomiting, apnea, coma, death if untreated; intellectual disability | Protein restriction ${ }^{b}$ : EAA and citrulline supplementation (in conjunction with nitrogen scavenging medications) |
| Citrullinemia | Argininosuccinic synthetase | $X X$ | Hyperammonemia, respiratory alkalosis | Lethargy, vomiting, apnea, coma, death if untreated; intellectual disability | Protein restriction ${ }^{b}$ : EAA and arginine supplementation (in conjunction with nitrogen scavenging medications) |
| Argininosuccinic aciduria | Argininosuccinic lyase | $X X$ | Hyperammonemia, respiratory alkalosis | Lethargy, vomiting, apnea, coma, death if untreated; cirrhosis, intellectual disability | Protein restriction ${ }^{b}$ : EAA and arginine supplementation (in conjunction with nitrogen scavenging medications) |
| Argininemia | Arginase | X | $\pm$ Hyperammonemia | Spastic diplegia, death if untreated; intellectual disability | Protein restriction ${ }^{b}$ : EAA supplementation (in conjunction with nitrogen scavenging medications) |

${ }^{a}$ The disorder is included in NBS: $X X=$ listed as core disorder for screening; $X=$ listed as secondary disorder for screening based on Recommended Uniform Screening Panel.
${ }^{\mathrm{b}}$ This IEM can include a medical food (formula) as part of treatment.

Except in milder forms of these disorders, diet treatment is typically paired with medications, including nitrogen scavengers (ie, Ravicti, Hyperion Therapeutics) or enzyme cofactors (carglumic acid for $N$-acetylglutamate synthase [NAGS] deficiency; Carbalglu, Recordati Rare Diseases). ${ }^{15}$ The outcome of treatment varies depending on the severity of the enzyme defect and prevention of hyperammonemia with aggressive illness management. For those with severe forms of these disorders, early liver transplant is often indicated. ${ }^{18}$

# Example: Ornithine Transcarbamylase Deficiency 

The most common UCD is ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency. OTC deficiency can present in neonatal crisis or later in infancy or childhood, depending on the degree of enzyme deficiency. ${ }^{15}$ Unlike the other UCDs, which are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, OTC is X-linked; female carriers may not be diagnosed until they have a child with this disorder or when experiencing severe catabolism, such as during delivery and the postpartum period. ${ }^{19}$

## Medical Nutrition Therapy Basics for OTC Deficiency

The goal for nutrition management of OTC deficiency is to maintain normal ammonia and plasma amino acid levels with protein restriction while providing sufficient energy sources to promote normal growth and development. In OTC deficiency and other UCDs, total protein is

--- page 373 ---

limited. This is different from many other IEM wherein total protein is not limited but is provided as medical food without the offending amino acid(s). ${ }^{20,21}$

The nutrition treatment for OTC deficiency includes the following ${ }^{20,21}$ :

1. Ensure adequate energy intake to prevent catabolism.
2. Total protein restriction is typically at DRI for age or below.
3. Protein composition includes essential amino acids (EAAs) and intact protein sources.
a. Provide $30 \%-50 \%$ of total protein from a medical food providing only EAAs (ie, Cyclinex 1, Abbott Nutrition).
b. The remainder of total protein will come from intact sources.
4. Amino acid supplementation: In all UCDs except arginase deficiency, arginine becomes a conditionally EAA to replace arginine that is typically produced by the urea cycle. ${ }^{22}$
a. In OTC deficiency, supplement with l-citrulline ( $100-200 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ ) to prevent arginine deficiency.
b. See Table 17-2 for amino acid (L-arginine or L-citrulline) to supplement in other UCDs.
5. Frequent monitoring of amino acid profiles is the primary marker for diet adjustments.

# Routine Monitoring for OTC 

## Routine monitoring for OTC includes the following:

1. Ammonia: Often only checked during acute situations, given the difficulty of laboratory draw and processing, which can lead to false elevations. ${ }^{23}$
2. Amino acid profiles
a. Glutamine: Primary marker to adjust protein prescription; can be elevated even without hyperammonemia. ${ }^{24}$
b. Arginine and citrulline are used to assess success of supplementation.
c. BCAAs (leucine, valine, isoleucine) are used to assess the overall sufficiency of protein intake; BCAAs may be low with nitrogen scavenger medications.

## Acute Care for OTC

Acute care for OTC includes the following ${ }^{20,25,26}$ :

1. Provide optimal nonprotein caloric support.
a. Calories

- Individuals may require $120 \%$ of DRI for age.
b. Dextrose
- Start with $10 \%-20 \%$ dextrose solution at an age-appropriate GIR.
- Insulin may be needed in the presence of hyperglycemia to allow for adequate caloric support.
c. Intralipid
- Age-appropriate dosing: $2-3 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ (infants/toddlers); up to $3-4 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ in neonates.
d. Protein
- Goal is to initiate a source of amino acids within 24 hours of admission or when a patient is dialyzed to prevent further catabolism.

2. Start a parenteral EAA solution (or enteral, if tolerated) at $0.25-0.5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$. If an EAA solution is not available, use a standard parenteral amino acid source to prevent delay in initiation.
a. Advance EAA delivery based on clinical status and ammonia and amino acid concentrations.
b. Initiate enteral EAA source as soon as possible, even if only small volumes are tolerated.
c. Transition, as tolerated, to enteral feeds providing approximately $30 \%-50 \%$ of estimated total protein needs from an EAA medical food with remainder from intact sources.
d. For neonates, intact protein sources can include breast milk.

## Organic Acidemias

Organic acidemias (OAs) are a group of inherited genetic disorders involved in the degradation of BCAAs, methionine, and/or threonine with production of non-amino acid organic acids that cause disruption in normal metabolism (Table 17-3). ${ }^{2}$ Organic acids bind to carnitine (as acylcarnitine) and are detected in the blood and urine. Thus, supplemental L-carnitine is included

--- page 374 ---

in the treatment for OAs to avoid depletion of free carnitine stores. ${ }^{27}$ OAs can present in a severe neonatal form; milder forms present during the first year or later. ${ }^{28}$

TABLE 17-3. Organic Acidemias

| Disorder | Enzyme Affected | NBS $^{\text {a }}$ | Biochemical Findings | Clinical Features | Nutrition Modification |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Glutaric acidemia type I | Glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase | XX | Elevated blood, urine, and CSF glutaric acid and 3-hydroxy-glutaric acid; metabolic acidosis | Acute metabolic crisis (vomiting, acidosis) and neurological deterioration triggered by illness; macrocephaly, ataxia, choreoathetosis, developmental delay | - Lysine and tryptophan restriction ${ }^{b}$; carnitine supplementation <br> - Dietary protein restriction may be liberalized after 6 y of age <br> - May have partial response to riboflavin 100$300 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ orally |

${ }^{a}$ The disorder is included in NBS: $X X=$ listed as core disorder for screening; $X=$ listed as secondary disorder for screening based on the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel.
${ }^{\text {b }}$ This IEM can include a medical food (formula) as part of treatment.

# Example: Propionic Acidemia 

Oxidation of the propiogenic amino acids valine, methionine, isoleucine, and threonine results in the production of propionyl-coenzyme A (CoA) by the enzyme propionyl-CoA carboxylase. In

--- page 375 ---

individuals with propionic acidemia (PROP), this enzyme deficiency results in the accumulation of propionyl-CoA and its metabolites, which inhibit the Krebs cycle and other pathways, resulting in a secondary energy deficit. ${ }^{29}$ In the United States, the incidence of PROP is thought to be 1 in $105,000-130,000$ births. ${ }^{30}$

# Medical Nutrition Therapy Basics for PROP 

The goals for nutrition management of PROP include restricting the propiogenic amino acids to reduce production of toxic metabolites while providing adequate total protein and calories to allow for normal growth and development. ${ }^{27,31}$ The effectiveness of diet treatment varies with the severity of the disorder. Liver transplant is an option; however, complications can remain, and patients still require some protein restriction and L-carnitine supplementation. ${ }^{32}$

The nutrition treatment for PROP includes the following ${ }^{27,31}$ :

1. Provide age-appropriate calories and fluid depending on activity level.
2. Restrict intact protein to reduce intake of the propiogenic amino acids, without resulting in deficiencies.
a. Intact protein goal intake is $60 \%-100 \%$ of DRI recommendations for age.
3. Provide a medical food (protein substitute without isoleucine, valine, methionine, and threonine [ie, MMA/PA Anamix Early Years, Nutricia North America]) if the patient's intact protein tolerance remains below total DRI requirements; the goal for total protein is $120 \%$ of DRI requirements.
4. L-carnitine supplementation: Provide L-carnitine to maintain free carnitine levels in the normal range; $50-100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ is often used as a starting dose.

## Routine Monitoring for PROP

Routine monitoring for PROP includes the following ${ }^{27,31}$ :

1. Plasma amino acids:
a. Maintain low normal concentrations of valine, methionine, isoleucine, and threonine; each laboratory will have its own normal range for various amino acids.
b. Low BCAAs (leucine, valine, isoleucine) can suggest overrestriction of protein.
c. Glycine will be elevated in all individuals with PROP.
2. Plasma carnitine profile (total, free, esterified fractions)
a. Supplemental carnitine dose is adjusted to prevent deficient free carnitine.
3. Complete blood cell count and chemistry panela. Evaluate for neutropenia, metabolic acidosis, and liver impairment. These laboratory values are expected to be normal in a well state.
4. Ammonia
a. Some individuals with PROP are prone to hyperammonemia. Goal is to maintain normal concentrations. ${ }^{26}$

## Acute Care for PROP

Management of an acutely ill individual with PROP or another OA focuses on promoting anabolism, detoxification, and other supportive treatments. ${ }^{27,33}$ In less severe decompensation, providing dextrose (D10 IV fluids) at an age-appropriate GIR for 24-48 hours may be sufficient to allow the individual to start/resume their usual nutrition plan of care.

If the individual remains acutely ill, escalation in nutrition support may be needed. Nutrition support guidelines for individuals with PROP are available. ${ }^{27,31}$ Individuals may require $110 \%$ $120 \%$ of usual energy needs using age-appropriate dextrose and intralipid recommendations.

Protein recommendations are as follows: ${ }^{27}$

1. Restrict protein intake no longer that $24-48$ hours, depending on clinical status.

--- page 376 ---

2. Initiate or restart an enteral source of intact protein when ammonia, plasma amino acids, and other laboratory results indicate metabolic stability. Add a medical food to meet the total protein goal.
a. Initial goal is $0.50 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$; increase by $0.25 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$, as tolerated.
3. If parenteral support is needed long term and protein goals cannot be met, consider a combination of a standard amino acid solution and specialty amino acid solutions without the propiogenic amino acids.

# Disorders of Fatty Acid Oxidation 

Fatty acid oxidation disorders (FAODs) are a group of inherited genetic disorders involved in the carnitine cycle for the transport of fatty acids across the mitochondrial membrane, $\beta$-oxidation, or ketone use (see Table 17-4). ${ }^{2,34}$ Prevention of extended fasting and attention during intercurrent illnesses or other catabolic events is essential for all FAODs. Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) is one of the most common metabolic disorders with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 13,000-19,000 in the United States. ${ }^{35}$ MCAD does not require a specific diet intervention. However, the long-chain FAODs (LC-FAODs) typically require restriction of longchain fat (LCF) sources and supplementation of medium-chain triglyceride (MCTs).

## TABLE 17-4. Fatty Acid Oxidation Disorders

## Example: Very-Long-Chain Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency

The very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase enzyme allows for oxidation of fatty acids of 10 20 carbons in length. Very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (VLCAD) has a wide spectrum of phenotypes. Those with severe VLCAD can present with cardiomyopathy in the neonatal period and are at risk for episodes of hypoketotic hypoglycemia with illness. Those with mild VLCAD can remain asymptomatic but may develop exercise intolerance with episodes of

rhabdomyolysis in adolescence. Nutrition management for other disorders of long-chain fatty acid metabolism is similar to that for VLCAD. ${ }^{36,37}$

# Medical Nutrition Therapy Basics for VLCAD 

The goals for nutrition management of VLCAD include providing fasting precautions and providing adequate calories for normal growth and development. LCF from diet sources is limited, and a source of MCTs is added to bypass the enzymes involved in $\beta$-oxidation of longchain fatty acids. MCTs provide a source of fatty acids for continued $\beta$-oxidation and production of ketones. ${ }^{36,37}$

The nutrition treatment for VLCAD includes the following ${ }^{36,37}$ :

1. Avoid extended fasting: Maximum 3-4 hours for those under 4 months of age; $8-10$ hours above 1 year of age. ${ }^{38}$
2. Provide appropriate energy and fluid needs for age.
3. Meet age-appropriate recommendations for total fat intake from dietary fat and MCT sources.
4. Restrict intake of LCF from dietary sources, depending on age and disease severity.
a. All sources of dietary fat can be counted as LCF and include triglycerides with unsaturated or saturated fatty acids of 10 or more carbons in length. The most common fatty acid found in food is palmitic acid (C16:0).
b. Those with severe forms of VLCAD need to limit dietary fat to $10 \%-15 \%$ of total calories.
5. Provide a source of MCTs.
a. Choose a low-fat, MCT-supplemented medical food (ie, Enfaport, Mead Johnson). MCT oil or powder can be added to the diet after 1 year of age.
b. MCT doses range from $10 \%$ to $45 \%$ of total kilocalories, or $2-3 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg}$ in infants and $1.0-1.25 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg}$ after the first year, depending on age and disease severity.
c. Replacement of standard sources of MCTs with triheptanoin (Doljolvi, Ultragenyx Pharmaceuticals), an odd-chain fatty acid, may improve cardiac function and reduce metabolic crises, especially in those with severe forms of LCFAOD. ${ }^{39,40}$
6. Supplement with sources of essential fatty acids (EFAs) to maintain normal plasma concentrations, if needed.
7. Higher protein intake may preserve lean body mass and reduce hepatic fat deposition. ${ }^{41}$
8. Adjunct therapy
a. L-carnitine: Supplementation may not be needed unless free carnitine is $<10 \mathrm{umol} / \mathrm{L}$. Starting dose recommendation is $1025 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d} .{ }^{37}$

## Routine Monitoring for VLCAD

Routine monitoring for VLCAD includes the following ${ }^{36,37}$ :

1. Creatine kinase
a. Elevations suggest muscle injury and possible rhabdomyolysis. Normal or mild elevations can be seen in individuals with VLCAD in a well state.
2. Plasma carnitine profile (total, free, esterified)
a. Maintain plasma-free carnitine at above $10 \mathrm{umol} / \mathrm{L}$.
3. Chemistry panel
a. Evaluate for hypoglycemia and liver impairment.
b. In a well state, normoglycemia is expected. Individuals with VLCAD can have mild elevations in liver enzymes.
4. EFA profile
a. Normal concentrations of linolenic acid, $\alpha$-linolenic acid, arachidonic acid, docosahexaenoic acid and ratios (ie, Holman ratio) should be maintained.
5. Troponin and brain natriuretic peptide should be used to evaluate cardiac status. Elevations can be seen in a compromised cardiac state.

## Acute Care for VLCAD

The management of an acutely ill individual with a LC-FAOD focuses on promoting anabolism, maintaining blood glucose, addressing rhabdomyolysis, and other supportive treatments.

--- page 378 ---

Providing dextrose (D10 IV fluids) at an age-appropriate GIR for 24-48 hours may be sufficient to allow the individual to start/resume their usual nutrition plan of care. If the individual remains acutely ill, escalation in nutrition support may be needed. Individuals with VLCAD can be prescribed age-appropriate recommendations for energy, dextrose, protein, and micronutrients.

Recommendations for IV lipids include the following ${ }^{36,37}$ :

1. Initially hold IV lipid sources because of the inability to use long-chain fatty acids.
2. Provide an IV lipid source for EFAs if there is a prolonged nothing-by-mouth status.
a. Infants: Add by day 7 .
b. Adults: Add by day 10 .
c. SMOFlipid (Fresenius Kabi) may be beneficial because of its MCT content.
3. Initiate or resume enteral feedings following usual age-appropriate guidelines.

# Inborn Errors of Carbohydrate Metabolism 

Disorders of enzyme deficiencies in the metabolism of glucose, fructose, and galactose include hereditary fructose intolerance and galactosemia (Table 17-5). ${ }^{42,43}$ Glycogen storage diseases (GSDs) result from deficiency of enzymes involved in the synthesis or use of glycogen primarily in hepatic and/or muscle tissue, although other tissues such as heart or brain tissues can be involved. ${ }^{44,45}$ GSDs involving the liver often present with hypoglycemia, hepatomegaly, hyperlipidemia, and lactic acidosis. ${ }^{44,46}$ Those involving muscle present with muscle wasting, hypotonia, and/or rhabdomyolysis. ${ }^{44,47}$

## TABLE 17-5. Disorders of Carbohydrate Metabolism

${ }^{\text {b }}$ This IEM can include a medical food (formula) as part of treatment.

## Example: GSD, Type I (Von Gierke Disease)

--- page 379 ---

GSD I is the most common of the GSDs with a prevalence of 1 in 100,000 live births. ${ }^{48}$ In GSD I, a deficiency of the hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase complex can result in severe hypoglycemia because the enzyme complex is involved in both glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. There are 2 subtypes: (1) GSD Ia, which involves deficiency of glucose-6-phosphatase, and (2) GSD Ib, which involves deficiency of the glucose-6-phosphate transporter. GSD Ib has the same characteristics as GSD Ia but with the addition of neutropenia, increasing the risk of recurrent infections and chronic inflammatory bowel disease. Without sufficient glucose-6-phosphatase activity, fructose and galactose cannot be converted to glucose-6-phosphate, therefore, limiting fruit (fructose), sugar (sucrose), and dairy products (lactose) is recommended. ${ }^{49,50}$

# Medical Nutrition Therapy Basics for GSD la and Ib 

The goals for nutrition management of GSD Ia and Ib is to maintain normoglycemia ( $>70 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ) by preventing excessive fasting and supplementing with uncooked cornstarch (UCCS) as a slowrelease source of glucose. Avoiding excessive intake of fructose and galactose is necessary because both contribute to glycogen synthesis. ${ }^{49,50}$ Poor metabolic control can contribute to development of hepatic adenomas, renal failure, gout, and inadequate bone density.

1. Avoid excessive fasting.
a. Fasting should be $2-3$ hours maximum in infants and $4-6$ hours maximum in adults.
b. Evaluate blood glucose frequently to guide fasting tolerance.
c. Gastrostomy feeding with a nighttime drip is often required to avoid hypoglycemia in younger patients.

- Use a sucrose-free, soy-based formula for infants or a high-carbohydrate elemental formula for older individuals.

2. Carbohydrates ( $60 \%-70 \%$ of total energy)
a. Emphasize complex sources; avoid simple sugar sources.
b. Limit fructose to 2.5 g per meal, and limit dairy to 1 serving per day.
c. UCCS can be used to provide a slow-release source of glucose.

- Initiate in infants over 9-12 months of age because insufficient pancreatic amylase enzyme activity exists for digestion of UCCS before this age.
- Initiate UCCS with 1 g per dose, increasing by 1 g per dose each week until the optimal dose is achieved.
- Mix in formula or cold water, and do not heat or add to acidic foods; 1 g of UCCS mixes in $2-3 \mathrm{~mL}$ of fluid.
- UCCS needs vary with age, weight, and fasting tolerance. ${ }^{50,51}$ Use the Bier equation to determine the ideal carbohydrate dose for each feeding (includes formula + UCCS) for children under 8 years of age and weighing $<30$ kg :

$$
\begin{gathered}
Y=0.0014 X^{3}-0.214 X^{2}+10.411 X-9.084 \\
Y=\mathrm{mg} / \text { glucose } / \mathrm{min} \text { and } X=\text { weight in } \mathrm{kg}
\end{gathered}
$$

- 1 g UCCS provides 0.9 g glucose. UCCS is typically divided into $4-8$ doses per day and adjusted based on blood glucose monitoring.
d. Glycosade (Vitaflo USA) ( 55 g of UCCS $=60 \mathrm{~g}$ Glycosade) is a high-amylopectin cornstarch that may extend overnight fasting tolerance in those over 5 years of age. Efficacy is greater for those with GSD Ia than for those with GSD Ib. ${ }^{52,53}$

3. Lean protein ( $10 \%-15 \%$ of total energy)
4. Low fat ( $<30 \%$ of total energy)
5. Micronutrient supplementation: Complete vitamin and mineral, calcium, and vitamin D supplementation is needed because of dietary restrictions.

## Routine Monitoring for GSD la and Ib

Routine monitoring for GSD Ia and Ib includes the following ${ }^{49,50}$ :

1. Blood glucose: avoid hypoglycemia (Goal $>70 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ )

--- page 380 ---

a. Frequent monitoring of blood glucose is required.
b. Consider a continuous glucose monitor to assess blood glucose trends. ${ }^{54}$
2. Other laboratory tests include lactic acid, lipid panel, uric acid, liver transaminases, and renal function. Individuals under good metabolic control can maintain levels in the normal range; however, elevations in some of these laboratory markers will remain.

# Acute Care for GSD la and Ib 

Management of an acutely ill individual with GSD type I focuses on preventing hypoglycemia and minimizing lactic acidemia. ${ }^{49,50}$ Providing dextrose (D10 IV fluids) at an age-appropriate GIR for 24-48 hours when ill may be sufficient to allow the individual to start/resume their usual nutrition plan of care.

For individuals that are unable to resume UCCS regimen and oral diet after several days, additional nutrition support may be needed. Follow age-appropriate guidelines for energy, dextrose, protein, lipids, and micronutrients. When resuming UCCS therapy,

1. Begin with $25 \%-50 \%$ of usual cornstarch doses and advance toward the goal.
2. Taper IV support as UCCS is increased and tolerated and maintain blood glucose above $70 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$.

## Inflammatory Bowel Disease

Anam Bashir, MD<br>Praveen S. Goday, MBBS

## Introduction

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by inflammation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and can involve the entire tract from the mouth to anus. It consists of Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), and indeterminate colitis; UC affects only the colon, but CD can affect the entire GI tract. The disease results from a complex interplay of genetic, immune, and environmental factors. Diet may contribute to the pathophysiology and is suspected to be a risk factor, thus the interest in nutrition therapies for CD. However, the use of nutrition therapy in UC is not supported by data. Inflammation of the GI tract often leads to malabsorption and poor oral intake. Children with IBD, and especially CD, are at risk of growth failure and malnutrition. Prevention of malnutrition, micronutrient deficiencies, and promoting optimal growth and development is important. In this chapter, we will review the nutrition therapies in CD and optimal nutrition strategies to prevent micronutrient deficiencies and malnutrition.

## Assessment and Nutrient Requirements

--- page 385 ---

Children with IBD are at increased risk for nutrient losses during times of active disease from diarrhea, vomiting, and decreased appetite. In addition, chronic inflammation associated with IBD and medications such as steroids may impact their growth. For these reasons, a detailed nutrition assessment is critical:

- History: Nausea, vomiting, appetite, and dietary recall of 3-5 days
- Nutrition-focused physical examination
- Anthropometric data: Weight, height, body mass index, height velocity
- Laboratory assessment: Iron studies (ferritin, total iron binding capacity, transferrin saturation, serum iron), a complete blood cell count, and vitamin D levels should be measured annually. Additional laboratory assessment may be needed in select patients (Table 18-1).

# Implementation of Nutrition Plan and Monitoring 

The nutrition management of IBD involves nutrition therapies and optimizing nutrition to prevent malnutrition and prevent vitamin and micronutrient deficiencies.

## Nutrition Therapies for Crohn's Disease

The mainstays of nutrition therapy for patients with CD include exclusive enteral nutrition, which can promote mucosal healing in active luminal CD. It is used as first-line induction therapy as an alternative to antiinflammatory medications. ${ }^{1-3}$ Other nutrition therapies for CD include partial enteral nutrition (PEN) and CD exclusion diet (CDED). CDED + PEN can be considered for induction by 6 weeks and maintenance of remission at 12 weeks (see Table 18-2). ${ }^{1-3}$

| Type of Diet | Inclusion | Restriction/Avoidance | Nutrition Consideration | Other Information |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| EEN | - 100\% formula-based diet (polymeric formula/semielemental formula/elemental formula) orally or via nasogastric tube, usually for $6-8 \mathrm{wk}$ <br> - Solids gradually introduced after weaning formula | All table foods (can consume hard-boiled candy and calorie-free flavored water) | - Monitoring for adherence <br> - Monitoring of electrolytes because of risk refeeding when starting EEN <br> - Diet is considered nutritionally adequate | - Widely accepted as first-line therapy for induction for active luminal disease <br> - Avoids steroid-related adverse effects such as risk of infections <br> - Nonadherence is a limiting factor |

Abbreviations: CDED, Crohn's Disease Exclusion Diet; CD-TREAT, Crohn's Disease Treatment with Eating Diet; EEN, exclusive enteral nutrition; PEN, partial enteral nutrition; SCD, specific carbohydrate diet.

More research is needed to incorporate other dietary therapies in daily practice. Several other exclusion diets such as the Low in Fermentable Oligo-, Di-, and Monosaccharides and Polyol (FODMAP) diet, paleolithic diet, and vegan diet have been proposed but require further research. ${ }^{1-3}$

# Prevention of Malnutrition 

Children with poor energy stores and active inflammation require 5\%$35 \%$ more energy than healthy children. Patients with active inflammation or infection, and patients who are recovering from surgery require higher protein intake than healthy children. If oral nutrition is inadequate, enteral nutrition (EN) may be recommended, and if EN is not feasible, parenteral nutrition may be required. ${ }^{4}$

## Prevention of Vitamin and Micronutrient Deficiency

Vitamin D, iron, and zinc deficiencies most commonly occur in children with IBD (Table 18-1). To prevent deficiency, patients with IBD need careful monitoring and supplementation as needed. ${ }^{4,5}$

--- page 390 ---

- Patients younger than age 8 can usually be supplemented with standard complete multivitamins.
- For children older than age 9, prenatal vitamins are usually sufficient. ${ }^{4}$

## Renal Disease

Paige Balgie, RDN, LD

## Introduction

The primary causes of pediatric renal disease differ greatly from adult disease. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined by the "Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes Guidelines" as abnormalities of the kidney structure or function or by decline in glomerular filtration rate below $60 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min} / 1.73 \mathrm{~m}^{2}$, present for more than 3 months, which has been categorized via a continuum of stages (see Table 19-1). ${ }^{1}$ About 50\% of pediatric CKD is related to structural abnormalities at birth known as congenital anomalies of the urinary tract, which often affects males more than females, with the most common diagnoses being congenital obstructive uropathy and aplastic, hypoplastic, or dysplastic kidneys. Functional abnormalities can encompass glomerular diseases, with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis being a common diagnosis of children with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). With less than $2 \%$ of the ESRD population being pediatric, the population is small, but the nutrition challenges are profound and complex. ${ }^{2}$

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is an abrupt decrease in kidney function with rise in serum creatinine or decrease in urine output. Etiologies of AKI are often categorized as prerenal, intrinsic, and postrenal, with the resolution of etiology aiming to improve and reverse kidney dysfunction. ${ }^{2}$ Nutrition interventions depend on the degree and length of kidney dysfunction, often using staging of CKD (although temporary) and intensive care fundamentals.

Nephrotic syndrome is a combination of symptoms including proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia, anasarca, and oliguria. ${ }^{2}$ Nephrotic syndrome can be idiopathic or congenital, with idiopathic renal diseases being most common; specifically, minimal change disease accounts for about $80 \%$ of nephrotic syndrome cases in childhood. ${ }^{3}$ Nutrition interventions such as decreasing sodium and fluid intake along with pharmacologic care are imperative to medical management of nephrotic syndrome.

Nephrolithiasis, or calculi within the urinary tract, also known as kidney stones, can have significant nutrition modifications for preventing recurrence of stone formation. Although some have genetic or familial origins such as primary hyperoxaluria, much of pediatric kidney stone formation is related to lifestyle habits, environment, and diet. Increased

--- page 393 ---

risk factors for kidney stones include obesity, hypertension, living in a warm climate, and secondary diagnoses such as short bowel syndrome and Crohn's disease. More than $50 \%$ of kidney stones contain calcium and oxalate, with many children exhibiting hypercalciuria and hypocitraturia. ${ }^{2}$ Eliminating risk factors for stone formation through diet (see Table 19-2) and lifestyle is strongly recommended.

# Renal Replacement Therapy 

## Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy

Continuous renal replacement therapy is continuous or nearly continuous fluid and/or solute removal, with multiple methods of therapy depending on the needs of a critically ill patient to replace kidney function.

--- page 394 ---

# Hemodialysis 

Hemodialysis (HD) or intermittent HD is fluid and/or solute removal from blood via a central venous catheter or surgically constructed arteriovenous fistula using passive diffusion with a semipermeable membrane. Pediatric HD treatments are often 3-4 hours 3-5 times per week, most often in a dialysis center depending on the child's size, fluid status, metabolic abnormalities, and tolerance. ${ }^{2}$

## Peritoneal Dialysis

Peritoneal dialysis is fluid and solute removal via a surgically placed catheter into peritoneal cavity using passive diffusion with the peritoneal membrane. Therapy is typically $10-12$ hours nightly, with dialysate fluid being infused and drained (a cycle) often using an automated cycler machine in pediatrics. ${ }^{2}$ Dialysate solutions contain various degrees of dextrose ( $1.5 \%, 2.5 \%$, or $4.25 \%$ ), sodium, chloride, magnesium, calcium, and lactate to create gradients for diffusion.

## Transplant

Solid organ transplant of a living or deceased donor kidney can be preemptive or for children with ESRD on dialysis if the patient meets criteria as a surgical candidate by the transplant team. Children often need to be around 10 kg or more to be eligible to proceed with transplant because of the size constraints of receiving an adult kidney.

## Assessment and Nutrient Requirements

## Assessment and Growth

Poor weight gain and linear growth continue to be the most challenging and recognizable adverse events and can result in decline of quality of life and risk of hospitalization and mortality for pediatric CKD. ${ }^{2}$ Reasons for this decline can be decreased nutrition intake, hormonal abnormalities affecting appetite, urinary or dialysis losses of nutrients, renal

--- page 395 ---

osteodystrophy, acidosis, uremia, growth hormone abnormalities, prematurity, steroid use, and inflammation. ${ }^{2}$ Obtaining and monitoring anthropometrics are extremely important in this population. ${ }^{4}$

# Euvolemic Weight 

Determine the weight at which the child is neither fluid overloaded nor dehydrated, which can be based on physical examination, vital signs, and symptoms. See chapter 1, "Nutrition Screening and History," for nutrition-focused physical examination. Use euvolemic or "dry" weight for nutrition calculations and growth monitoring. ${ }^{2,4}$

## Body Mass Index and Body Composition

Children can have decreased lean mass with higher adiposity. Because of short stature, the body mass index (BMI) of individuals that fall below the third percentile for height may overestimate the prevalence of underweight and lean body mass. It is recommended to adjust BMI for age using the height age of the child, for which the child's height would be at the fiftieth percentile, to better estimate lean mass and adiposity. However, once the child has reached adult height, this method is no longer appropriate. ${ }^{4}$

## Estimating Needs

Despite poor weight gain and linear growth, estimating energy needs in pediatric kidney disease should be based on age-appropriate calculations and methods. Patients with nephrotic syndrome, progressing CKD, and receiving renal replacement therapies may require adjustments of energy and protein intakes to achieve goal weight gain, growth, and serum levels as listed in Table 19-3.

# Electrolytes and Micronutrients 

Electrolyte and micronutrient intake in pediatric kidney disease continue to be the most challenging to manage because patients require individualized prescriptions that must be monitored and adjusted based on laboratory values, age, growth, and degree of kidney function.

--- page 397 ---

Micronutrient considerations are listed in Table 19-4, including restrictions, monitoring, and rationale for concern. See also Table 19-5.

--- page 398 ---

| Micronutrient | Description | Recommendations |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Sodium | Needs can vary pending fluid status, sodium losses in urine or dialysate, hypertension, and cardiovascular risk. | - Restriction: 1500 mg or $1-3 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}^{\mathrm{a}}$ <br> - Supplement considered in the following: <br> - Infancy <br> - Exclusively enterally fed children on PD <br> - Salt wasting defects |
| Potassium | 90\% of potassium excretion is via the kidney, and fatal cardiac arrythmias can occur with severe derangements in potassium levels. | - Restriction: Based on serum potassium levels after assessment of dietary intake <br> - Challenge: Estimating potassium additives in processed foods that can be $90 \%-100 \%$ bioavailable ${ }^{b}$ <br> - Supplement: PD losses may be greater than intake because of poor appetite and food preferences. <br> Hyperkalemia: <br> - Use of SPS or patiromer to reduce potassium levels <br> - See Exhibit 19-1 for pretreatment of liquids with SPS and considerations of use. <br> - Consider nondietary causes of hyperkalemia or hypokalemia in Exhibit 19-2. |

| Micronutrient | Description | Recommendations |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Phosphorus | Serum levels are sensitive indicators <br> of progression of CKD, including <br> contributing to the following: <br> - PTH levels <br> - Calcium deposition and absorption <br> - Vitamin D status (active and <br> inactive forms) <br> Achieving goal serum levels is key to <br> preventing CKD-MBD. | - Restriction: CKD stages <br> 3-5D: Limit phosphorus <br> intake to 80\%-100\% <br> DRI for age to maintain <br> serum levels within <br> normal limits. <br> - Challenge: Limiting <br> phosphorus additives in <br> processed foods <br> because of nearly 100\% <br> bioavailability. <br> - Chronic <br> hypophosphatemia <br> related to low <br> phosphorus intake or <br> phosphorus wasting <br> diseases is detrimental <br> to bone health and <br> growth. <br> - Phosphorus binder <br> medications may be <br> used if dosed at the time <br> of oral intake and/or <br> enteral feedings (see <br> Table 19-5). |

| Micronutrient | Description | Recommendations |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Calcium | - Potential for both hypercalcemia and hypocalcemia <br> - Hypercalcemia due to the following: <br> - Medications <br> - Medical treatments (dialysis) <br> - Elevated vitamin D or vitamin A intake <br> - Hypocalcemia due to the following: <br> - Low dietary calcium intake <br> - Elevated serum phosphorus <br> - Decreased 1,25dihydroxyvitamin D (active) <br> - Vitamin D deficiency (inactive) <br> - Magnesium deficiency <br> - Hypoparathyroidism | - Closely monitor calcium levels. <br> - Intake below DRI may result in poor bone mineralization, whereas excessive calcium intake may contribute to cardiovascular disease. <br> - Do not exceed 200\% DRI for age or 2500 mg calcium intake in adolescents from all sources (dietary, enteral, medications). <br> - Avoid use of calcium citrate with concern for increased aluminum absorption; calcium chloride could contribute to metabolic acidosis. ${ }^{\text {a }}$ |
| Vitamin D | - Both inactive (25-hydroxyvitamin D) and active (1,25dihydroxyvitamin D) are important components of bone and cardiovascular health in relation to their effect on the calcium-PTHvitamin D axis. <br> - The kidney will convert inactive to active vitamin D; however, with kidney dysfunction, supplemental active vitamin D is required in response to secondary hyperparathyroidism. | - Inactive vitamin D levels should be maintained in normal range for positive effects on inflammation, bone health, and cardiovascular risk. ${ }^{a}$ <br> - Assess and monitor 25hydroxyvitamin D (inactive) status in all pediatric renal disease. <br> - If on dietary vitamin D supplementation (ergocalciferol or cholecalciferol) and with normal vitamin D levels, measure serum levels every 6 mo . <br> - If a low level of vitamin D is found, adjust supplementation and repeat serum levels in 3 mo. ${ }^{\text {d }}$ |

One method of lowering potassium in liquids including human milk, formulas (oral and enteral), and beverages such as cow's milk is the use of medications to lower the potassium content with a binding agent. Potassium, when bound to the heavy polymer, falls to the bottom of the container, which creates a sludge that can be discarded. Exhibit 19-1 describes use of sodium polystyrene sulfonate. When potassium intake has been exhausted, yet electrolyte derangements remain, clinicians should consider nondietary contributors as listed in Exhibit 19-2. The nutrition considerations of each renal replacement therapy can be found in Exhibit 19-3.

# EXHIBIT 19-1. Pretreatment of Liquids to Reduce Potassium Content 

- Add sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS) to volume of formula or expressed human milk, allow it to precipitate for a minimum of 30 minutes in a refrigerator, then decant the liquid from the residue that has settled at the bottom of the container.
- Suggested starting dose of SPS is $0.4-1.5 \mathrm{~g} / 100 \mathrm{~mL}$ or $0.25-1 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mmol} \mathrm{K}$.
- Acting as an exchange resin, SPS could increase sodium, aluminum, iron, sulfur, pH while decreasing calcium, zinc, copper, phosphorus, manganese, and magnesium content of liquid.

## EXHIBIT 19-2. Nondietary Causes of Hyper- or Hypokalemia

## Nondietary causes of chronic hyperkalemia

- Constipation

- Exogenous potassium administration (oral potassium supplements, potassiumcontaining medications)


# Nondietary causes of chronic hypokalemia 

- Gastrointestinal potassium losses (vomiting, drainage from gastrostomy tubes, diarrhea, laxative or enema abuse)
- Dialysate potassium losses
- Medications: potassium-binding resins, diuretics
- Renal tubular diseases (such as cystinosis and Bartter syndrome)

## EXHIBIT 19-3. Nutrition Considerations of Renal Replacement Therapy

1. Continuous renal replacement therapy:
a. Higher protein provisions are recommended, and limitations in electrolytes are likely not needed because of continuous removal and losses.
b. Consider nonrenal formulas for enteral formula choice to provide lower osmolality and nutrition for primary disease state (eg, sepsis, cardiovascular, oncology, burns, etc).
c. May need additional supplementation of folate, thiamine, selenium, carnitine. ${ }^{a}$
2. Hemodialysis:
a. Limited intake of potassium, phosphorus, sodium, and fluid via oral intake, enteral, and parenteral nutrition often required. Individualized restrictions based on age, size, and urine output.
3. Peritoneal dialysis:
a. Daily dialysis may allow liberalized diet without potassium, sodium, or fluid restriction. Phosphorus restriction often remains.
b. May need to consider absorption of dextrose from the dialysate if the child is gaining weight rapidly and/or considered overweight or obese.
4. Transplant:
a. Successful kidney transplant should result in liberalization of electrolyte restrictions with increased fluid needs to maintain hydration.
b. Hypophosphatemia is common posttransplant related to increased urinary phosphate excretion, decreased intestinal phosphate absorption, and hyperparathyroidism requiring a high phosphorus diet and/or supplementation. ${ }^{b}$
c. Calcineurin inhibitor use (tacrolimus, cyclosporine) could result in hypomagnesemia and/or hyperkalemia. Magnesium supplementation, along with a high-magnesium diet, is often needed to maintain normal serum levels.

--- page 406 ---

Despite a functioning kidney, a low-potassium diet may be needed to maintain normal serum potassium levels. Avoid contraindicated fruits and their juices such as grapefruit because of disruption of drug metabolism.
d. Prevention of hyperlipidemia and cardiovascular disease is key to dietary goals posttransplant, including balanced macronutrient distribution with limited sodium, simple sugars, saturated fat, and trans fat. Rapid weight gain and obesity is common, which is thought to be related to improved appetite, reduction of malaise, liberalized diet, and/or use of corticosteroids. Nutrition counseling in weight management strategies is important after transplant. ${ }^{a}$
e. Follow food safety guidelines as established by the US Food and Drug Administration (https://www.fda.gov/food/people-risk-foodborne-illness/food-safety-older-adults-and-people-cancer-diabetes-hivaids-organ-transplants-and-autoimmune). ${ }^{a}$

# Implementation of Nutrition Plan and Monitoring 

For an infant with CKD, breast feeding and/or breast milk is considered the preferred diet for under 1 year of age. ${ }^{5}$ However, because of potential for poor weight gain and growth, gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, slow gastric emptying), restricted or increased fluid needs, and modifications in nutrient intake, infants and children with CKD often need supplemental enteral feedings and adjustments in dietary intake to achieve goals for growth and nutrient levels. If oral intake is safely allowed, enteral feedings aim to supplement intake to promote oral skills and prevent oral aversion. ${ }^{6}$ Oral or enteral formula selection is individualized to achieve energy, protein, fluid, electrolyte, and micronutrient goals. Often combinations of breast milk, formulas, modulars, additives, and medications are required to meet the individual's needs and tolerance (see Tables 19-6 and 19-7). Because of the limited formula options for children with CKD, infant formulas may be used in those greater than 1 year of age, as well as adult formulas

--- page 407 ---

being used in children greater than 1 year of age. The clinician must be mindful of macro- and micronutrient intake if using these outside of the indicated age groups.

## Liver Disease

Anam Bashir, MD
Praveen S. Goday, MBBS

## Introduction

The liver plays a role in the metabolism of all macronutrients. It stores glycogen, synthesizes major proteins, and makes bile, which is necessary for the absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins. In acute liver disease, malnutrition is unusual. ${ }^{1}$ Children with chronic liver disease are at risk of malnutrition because of liver function chronically being affected. In the early stages of liver dysfunction, malnutrition is secondary to malabsorption with increased expenditure. In end-stage liver disease, malnutrition is caused by malabsorption, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and increased metabolic demands. The management of chronic liver disease must include nutrition strategies to prevent malnutrition and nutrient deficiencies for optimal growth and development. Pretransplant nutrition status has a direct effect on recovery after transplant. ${ }^{2}$

## Assessment and Nutrient Requirements

Regular assessment of nutrition status and nutrition requirements is critical for children with liver disease to promote growth and minimize complications of their disease.

--- page 412 ---

- History: Dietary recall
- Nutrition-focused physical examination
- Anthropometrics: Weight (affected by fluid overload and organomegaly in liver disease), length or height, head circumference, midarm upper circumference, triceps or subscapular skinfold thickness (less likely to be affected by fluid overload); upper arm measurements less affected than lower limb or truncal measurements ${ }^{3}$
- Laboratory test: Screening for fat-soluble vitamin (vitamins A, D, E, and K) deficiencies and for iron deficiency every $1-3$ months $^{3}$

Liver disease affects macronutrient needs for multiple reasons, as outlined in Figure 20-1.

| Carbohydrates | Protein | Fat |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Risk of hypoglycemia due to decreased gluconeogenesis and reduced glycogen stores | - Increased use of protein for gluconeogenesis and reduced hepatocyte function to make proteins <br> - Increased breakdown leads to increased ammonia. <br> - Since children with chronic liver disease are growing, protein should not be restricted. <br> - Requirement is usually $3-4 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$. <br> - Branched-chain amino acids like leucine, isoleucine, and valine are preferred. <br> - If encephalopathic, may consider decreasing protein to $1-1.5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg}$. | - Cholestasis leads to malabsorption of fats due to decreased bile salts. <br> - Congested gastric mucosa and intestinal mucosa causes further worsening of fat malabsorption. <br> - Fat malabsorption can lead to deficiency of LCTs, fat-soluble vitamins, and essential fatty acids. <br> - Children with liver diseases need formula rich in MCTs, since MCTs do not require bile salts for absorption. <br> - To avoid essential fatty acid deficiency, supplemental essential fatty acids should be provided. <br> - LCTs should not be decreased to less than $10 \%$ of total energy intake to decrease the risk of essential fatty acid deficiency. |

FIGURE 20-1. Effects of liver disease on macronutrients. Abbreviations: LCT, longchain triglycerides; MCT, medium-chain triglycerides.

# Implementation of Nutrition Plan and Monitoring 

Children with liver disease require individualized nutrition plans and close monitoring. Energy intake should be $130 \%-150 \%$ of recommended daily allowance, which is about $130-150 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ in infants and $90-120$ $\mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ in children. ${ }^{1,4}$ Vitamin supplementation is outlined in Table 201 .

# Type and Mode of Feeds 

## Enteral Nutrition

Oral feeds are preferred when possible. Human milk is generally preferred, supplemented with medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil. If using fortification, human milk can be fortified with formula containing a higher proportion of MCTs. ${ }^{2}$ Most MCT-containing formulas have lower palatability because of hydrolyzed products, but generally infants tolerate the formulas better with time. ${ }^{2}$

If nutrition needs are not met orally, supplementation via a nasogastric (NG) tube is required. Starting continuous feeds at night improves intake during the day intake and maximizes oral nutrition. Gastrostomy tubes should be avoided in children with chronic liver disease because of portal hypertension and the possibility of peristomal varices. They can be considered in patients with more stable disease. NG tubes may exacerbate variceal bleed and should be placed with caution.

## Parenteral Nutrition

Children who cannot tolerate or fail to grow on EN may need parenteral nutrition (PN). The energy goal of PN should be based on estimated energy requirement for age because there is no risk of malabsorption. The fluid goal is typically $75 \%-90 \%$ of maintenance fluids because of the risk of ascites, and daily sodium is limited to $2-3 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{kg}$ because aggressive correction in end-stage liver disease can aggravate ascites. ${ }^{2}$

In end-stage liver disease, PN may be needed to run over 24 hours because of the risk of hypoglycemia. ${ }^{2}$

## Acute Liver Disease

Acute liver disease is a rapidly progressive disease that requires a multidisciplinary team including a hepatologist for management.

--- page 415 ---

Management of acute liver failure requires fluid resuscitation and electrolyte replacements as outlined in Table 20-2.

TABLE 20-2. Management of Complications of Acute Liver Disease

| Complication | Monitoring | Management |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Hypo/hyperglycemia | Glucose <br> checks | - Maintain blood glucose between 90 and <br> $120 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ <br> - Maintain glucose infusion rate of 10- <br> $15 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{min}$ |
| Hypo/hypernatremia | Electrolyte <br> monitoring | - Maintain sodium: 145-155 mmol/L <br> - Sodium restriction of 2-3 mEq/kg/d |
| Hypophosphatemia | Electrolyte <br> monitoring | Maintain serum level $>3 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ |

# Posttransplant Considerations of Nutrition 

## Early Postoperative Period

Early enteral feeds within 24-36 hours are preferred once postoperative ileus has resolved. NG tube feedings can be used.

Once oral feeds are started, enteral feeds can be used at night to maintain daytime appetite. The oral diet should be high protein and high

--- page 416 ---

energy to compensate for the weight loss before transplant and promote early healing. In the case of chylous ascites, a low-fat diet or low-longchain triglyceride formula can be used. ${ }^{2}$

PN should be used if surgical complications delay the initiation of enteral feeds. Electrolyte abnormalities are common after transplant and should be monitored. It is important to monitor for drug-nutrient interactions and counsel patients about possible interactions.

# Long-Term Posttransplant Nutrition 

A standard age-appropriate diet is appropriate for most children. The goal of energy intake is $100 \%-120 \%$ of the estimated energy requirement for catch-up growth. ${ }^{2}$ Once pretransplant weight gain is achieved and muscle mass is gained, careful weaning should be done to avoid excessive weight gain. Long-term increased energy and fat intake and the need for steroids can increase the risk of obesity.

The diet and anthropometrics of patients with a liver transplant should be monitored at each visit to prevent obesity, and patient and families should be educated about the risk of obesity. A diet low in saturated fat and high in fruits and vegetables should be encouraged.

Patients are at risk of bone disease because of fat-soluble vitamin maldigestion pretransplant, deconditioning and loop diuretics, and frequent steroid use.

- Vitamin D should be monitored at least every 3-6 months for the first 2 years after transplant.
- Following dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans annually can be considered.
- Calcium, magnesium, and phosphorous should be monitored regularly.
- Calcium supplementation should be considered in those with decreased bone density and vitamin D deficiency. ${ }^{3}$

## Introduction

Childhood cancer is the leading cause of death from a disease in children in the United States, affecting an estimated 1 in 285 children less than 20 years old with 15,780 new cases yearly. ${ }^{1}$ The survival rate of childhood cancer is $80 \%$, but it can be much lower for rare cancers. ${ }^{2}$

Types of childhood cancers include the following:

- Leukemia: Cancer of the blood; it is the most common type of childhood cancer. Types include
- Acute lymphoblastic leukemia and
- Acute myeloid leukemia. ${ }^{2}$
- Lymphoma: Cancer of the immune system; types include
- Hodgkin and
- Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. ${ }^{2}$
- Solid tumors: Cancer of the bones, organs, or tissues. The most common solid tumors in children include
- Brain and spinal cord tumors
- Ewing sarcoma
- Germ cell tumors
- Hepatoblastoma
- Kidney/Wilms tumors
- Neuroblastoma
- Osteosarcoma
- Retinoblastoma

--- page 419 ---

- Rhabdomyosarcoma ${ }^{2}$

Treatment options include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). ${ }^{3,4}$ HSCT is typically used for refractory or high-risk cancers and various nonmalignant conditions. HSCT is the transplant of bone marrow, peripheral blood stem cells, or umbilical cord blood to replace diseased and defective bone marrow and restore hematopoietic and immunologic function, typically after high-dose chemotherapy and/or radiation. Patients can receive their own stem cells (autologous) or cells from another person such as a sibling, parent (haploidentical), or unrelated donor (allogeneic). ${ }^{4,5}$

# Assessment and Nutrient Requirements 

Standard criteria that put patients at high nutrition risk apply to patients with cancer. Patients who do not meet these criteria but are receiving high-dose chemotherapy or combination therapy for aggressive cancers or are undergoing HSCT may be considered at high nutrition risk.

A standard nutrition assessment should be conducted at diagnosis, throughout treatment, and into survivorship with consideration for type and stage of cancer, treatment protocol, and effects of therapy. ${ }^{6,7}$ Anthropometric data should be compared with prediagnosis data and monitored longitudinally. ${ }^{6}$ A nutrition-focused physical examination can help identify the presence of lean muscle loss, increased fat mass, influence of tumor mass, and hydration status. Routine mid-upper arm circumference and triceps skinfold measurements may be a better indicator of nutrition status than weight because they are less affected by fluid shifts and tumor mass. Careful assessment of hair, eyes, mouth, skin, and nails should be conducted to identify signs of micronutrient deficiencies. ${ }^{7}$

## Malnutrition in Oncology and HSCT Patients

--- page 420 ---

Between $6 \%$ and $50 \%$ of children will present with acute malnutrition at diagnosis, whereas $8 \%-32 \%$ of children will develop malnutrition during treatment. ${ }^{4,8,9}$ The degree and pattern of malnutrition will depend on the diagnosis, stage of disease, intensity of the treatment regimen, socioeconomic status, nutrition status at diagnosis, and other comorbidities. ${ }^{10,11}$ Malnutrition during treatment can lead to decreased immune function, increased risk of infection, delayed wound healing, and altered drug metabolism. See Table 21-1 for the contributors to malnutrition in pediatric cancer.

# Energy, Protein, and Fluid Needs 

The energy needs of pediatric oncology and HSCT patients will vary depending on their current nutrition status, phase of the disease, and treatment plan. ${ }^{10}$ Indirect calorimetry (IC) is the gold standard to determine resting energy expenditure (REE) in this population. In the absence of IC, energy needs can by estimated by using a predictive equation such as the Schofield equation for the basal metabolic rate (BMR), the World Health Organization equation for the REE, or the estimated energy requirement equation with stress factors for growth, infections, and stress. ${ }^{7,13}$ See Tables 21-2 and 21-3 for calorie and protein requirements.

# Oral Nutrition 

Optimization of oral nutrition may be offered as an initial strategy, including an emphasis on small, frequent meals of nutrient-dense foods and beverages, as well as oral supplements. ${ }^{6}$ Appetite stimulants may be used, although their efficacy has not been consistently demonstrated. ${ }^{4,6}$ Common appetite simulants include megestrol, dronabinol, and cyproheptadine. Young children and toddlers are at risk for developing

--- page 424 ---

oral/food aversions because of nausea, vomiting, and taste changes during treatment. Referral to feeding therapy should be considered. ${ }^{10}$

Patients who are immunocompromised (absolute neutrophil count $<500$ cells $/ \mu \mathrm{L}$ ) should receive counseling on proper food safety guidelines as recommended by the US Food and Drug Administration (Exhibit 21-1). ${ }^{14}$ Recent studies have shown that following a neutropenic or low-microbial diet does not decrease risk of infection more than that of standard food safety practices. ${ }^{15,16}$

# EXHIBIT 21-1. Food Safety Practices for Immunocompromised Patients ${ }^{\text {a,b }}$ 

- Wash hands and surfaces often with warm soapy water.
- Do not share foods with others.
- Cook meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs to safe internal temperature.
- Reheat deli meats until steaming.
- Avoid raw eggs and raw sprouts.
- Store cold foods at $<40^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ and hot foods at $>140^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ to prevent bacterial growth.
- Buy only pasteurized milk, cheese, and dairy products.
- Wash raw fruits and vegetables well before eating.
- Use separate cutting boards for raw foods and ready-to-eat foods.
- Eat foods within their expiration/best-by dates.
- Refrigerate perishable foods within 2 hours of purchase/preparation.
- Eat refrigerated leftovers within 3 days of preparation.
- Avoid food from buffets, potlucks, sidewalk vendors, food trucks, salad bars, and open bins from grocery stores.

## Enteral Nutrition

Enteral nutrition (EN) via feeding tube should be considered when oral intake/supplementation is unsuccessful in maintaining adequate nutrition. For children undergoing highly intensive therapy, including HSCT, proactive EN tube placement should be considered. ${ }^{6}$ There can be

--- page 425 ---

hesitation and reluctance in providing EN within the pediatric oncology and HSCT community. EN can often be perceived as a punishment for not eating; therefore, it is important to present EN as a positive, not punitive, intervention. Studies have shown that EN in HSCT patients is feasible, reduces costs, and may have a protective benefit over PN in the development of acute gastrointestinal (GI) graft vs host disease (GVHD). ${ }^{17}$

Continuous feeds are generally better tolerated than intermittent bolus feedings and are the preferred schedule for patients at high risk for nausea and vomiting, constipation, or diarrhea. In patients with intractable vomiting, placement of a postpyloric feeding tube can minimize the risk of repeated reinsertions of the tube. ${ }^{6}$

Formula considerations include the following:

- For most oncology and HSCT patients, a low-osmolarity standard formula with or without fiber may be used to initiate tube feeds. ${ }^{6}$
- Extensively hydrolyzed or elemental formulas can be appropriate for patients with significant GI tract inflammation or malabsorption. ${ }^{6}$
- With postpyloric feeding, consider formulas with fiber or low osmolarity because they may minimize the duration and severity of diarrhea. ${ }^{6}$

Table 21-4 discusses other strategies for symptom management.

TABLE 21-4. Nutrition Strategies for Symptom Management

| Symptom | Dietary Intervention Strategies |
| :-- | :-- |
| Nausea/vomiting | Small, frequent meals; high-carbohydrate content; nonacidic <br> beverages; cold clear foods and beverages; avoid extreme <br> temperatures and highly seasoned items; avoid high fat content <br> items |
| Anorexia | Small, frequent meals; nutrient-dense foods and supplements; <br> carbohydrate and protein modulars; create a pleasant <br> atmosphere; dine with the child; vary colors, flavors, and textures <br> of food |
| Diarrhea | Low-fat, cold, or room-temperature foods; avoid caffeine; <br> encourage adequate fluid intake |
| Dysgeusia | Herbs, spices, and marinades; cold non-odorous foods; fruit- <br> flavored beverages; good oral hygiene; mint mouthwashes; <br> lemon-flavored beverages; sour candies |
| Mucositis | Soft diet; smooth, bland, moist foods; frozen slushes, ices, and <br> ice cream; high-calorie beverages |
| Xerostomia | Moist foods; encourage liquids with meals; add sauces, gravy, <br> butter, or broth; add vinegar and lemons to stimulate saliva; good <br> oral hygiene |

ASPEN Pediatric Nutrition Support Core Curriculum. 3rd ed. American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition. Forthcoming 2024.

# Parenteral Nutrition 

Parenteral nutrition (PN) should be considered when all attempts for sufficient oral and enteral feedings have failed or EN is contraindicated. ${ }^{6}$ Indications for PN include neutropenic enterocolitis, ileus, bowel obstruction/perforation, severe GI GVHD after HSCT, radiation enteritis, severe mucositis, intractable vomiting, and protracted diarrhea. ${ }^{4,6,7}$ Pediatric oncology patients receiving PN are at high risk for hepatoxicity due to hepatotoxic chemotherapy agents and infections. ${ }^{6}$

--- page 427 ---

# Vitamins and Minerals 

Oncology and HSCT patients are at risk of osteopenia and osteoporosis because of prolonged hospitalizations with decreased physical activity, decreased sun exposure, and treatments including methotrexate, corticosteroids, and radiation. ${ }^{10}$ Monitor and supplement serum 25hydroxyvitamin D levels at diagnosis and throughout treatment. Calcium supplementation should be considered for patients not meeting dietary reference intake (DRI) for age through oral or EN intake. ${ }^{10}$

The routine use of micronutrient supplements can be controversial, but in the depleted patient, supplementation within DRI for age is generally regarded as safe. ${ }^{6}$ Avoid iron supplements because of the risk for iron overload from frequent blood transfusions. ${ }^{7}$

## Laboratory Values

Clinical judgement should be used when assessing laboratory values because cancer therapy drugs, inflammation, infections, and fluid status may alter these results. ${ }^{6}$

## Additional Treatment-Related Adverse Effects

The following are additional treatment-related adverse effects:

- Pancreatitis: Nutrition recommendations for pancreatitis should be followed (see discussion on nutrition management of pancreatitis in chapter 22, "Pancreatitis").
- Tumor lysis syndrome: In cases of elevated potassium and phosphorus levels, some patients may need to limit potassium and phosphorus intake in their diet and use phosphorus binders. ${ }^{18}$
- Neutropenic enterocolitis (typhlitis): Bowel rest may be indicated, and PN may be required. ${ }^{6}$
- Steroids: Acute adverse effects of steroid use include hyperglycemia and increased appetite. A no-concentrated-sweets diet and the use of insulin may be indicated to help manage elevated blood glucose levels. Longer-term effects of steroid use include insulin resistance, decreased bone mineralization, and increases in fat mass. ${ }^{4,12}$
- GVHD: This is a condition in which donor-derived T cells attack host cells after HSCT. In cases of severe GI GVHD, patients may need bowel rest with PN followed by a lowfiber, low-lactose, low-fat, bland diet. ${ }^{10}$

--- page 428 ---

- Hepatic sinusoidal obstructive syndrome, also called hepatic veno-occlusive disease: This syndrome typically occurs within the first 10-20 days after HSCT. Chemotherapy toxicity leads to the narrowing and occlusion of hepatic venules, sinusoidal fibrosis, and hepatocyte necrosis, which results in hyperbilirubinemia, jaundice, weight gain, ascites, and painful hepatomegaly. Sodium and fluid restrictions are often indicated. ${ }^{19} \mathrm{EN}$ or oral diet is preferred over PN to reduce stress on the liver. ${ }^{20}$ If PN is indicated, measures to reduce stress on the liver should be taken such as preventing overfeeding, preventing high dextrose load, monitoring triglyceride levels, and discontinuing or reducing added copper and manganese. ${ }^{21}$


# Monitoring and Late Effects 

Survivors of childhood cancer are at risk for multiple long-term morbidities, including obesity, metabolic syndrome, heart disease, and osteopenia/osteoporosis. ${ }^{6}$ Promotion of a healthy lifestyle and ongoing nutrition assessment and counseling is beneficial.

## Pancreatitis

Anam Bashir, MD<br>Praveen S. Goday, MBBS

## Introduction

In this chapter, we will review the nutrition management of 3 categories of pancreatitis: acute, acute recurrent, and chronic (Table 22-1). Chronic pancreatitis related to cystic fibrosis (CF) is discussed in chapter 12, "Cystic Fibrosis."

--- page 431 ---

TABLE 22-1. Pancreatitis Diagnostic Criteria

| Type | Diagnostic Criteria |
| :-- | :-- |
| Acute | Child meeting 2 of the following 3 criteria: <br> 1. Acute abdominal pain (typically in the epigastrium) <br> 2. Serum lipase or amylase $\geq 3$ times the upper limit of normal <br> 3. Imaging findings (from ultrasonography, CT scanning, or MRI) <br> characteristic of acute pancreatitis |
| Acute <br> recurrent | Defined as having 2 episodes of acute pancreatitis with either complete <br> resolution of pain for at least 1 mo OR complete normalization of <br> pancreatic enzymes before the next episode, irrespective of the time <br> interval |
| Chronic | Defined as having either abdominal pain consistent with a pancreatic <br> origin and imaging findings suggestive of chronic pancreatitis OR <br> evidence of endocrine pancreatic insufficiency and either imaging findings <br> suggestive of chronic pancreatitis or surgical findings/biopsy specimens <br> demonstrating histopathologic features of chronic pancreatitis |

Abbreviations: CT, computed tomography; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging.

# Assessment and Nutrient Requirements 

Nutrition screening is required at admission for every child with acute pancreatitis. An initial screening and periodic rescreening are recommended in chronic pancreatitis because of the risk of vitamin and fat malabsorption. Children with acute recurrent pancreatitis or chronic pancreatitis should undergo nutrition screening at every outpatient follow-up visit, typically every 3-6 months.

- History: Dietary recall, assessment of malabsorption (stool frequency and consistency), and adherence to pancreatic enzymatic supplements.
- Physical exam: Anthropometric data (weight for age, weight for length, body mass index, mid-upper arm circumference, and triceps skinfold thickness).
- Laboratory assessment: Screening for pancreatic insufficiency with fecal elastase should be performed at least annually. Vitamin A, D, E, and K screening should be conducted annually, and a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scan should be done in case of malnutrition, persistently low vitamin D, or a history of fractures.


## Implementation of Nutrition Plan and Monitoring

--- page 432 ---

The type of pancreatitis a child has influences their nutrition plan and monitoring.

# Acute Pancreatitis 

For acute pancreatitis, early introduction of oral or enteral nutrition (EN) is recommended. ${ }^{1}$ An oral solid diet with no fat restrictions can be introduced early; this has been associated with a shorter length of stay and fewer intensive care unit admissions. The oral route is preferred to EN, but EN can be used when oral intake is poor. Parenteral nutrition $(\mathrm{PN})$ should be used only when oral, nasogastric, or nasojejunal feeds are not tolerated. If PN is needed, it should be combined with EN as tolerated.

## Acute Recurrent Pancreatitis

In between episodes of acute pancreatitis, children should be given a regular-fat diet, except for patients with hypertriglyceridemia. A lowfiber diet is preferred with pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy because fiber can absorb pancreatic enzymes and/or decrease their action. In case of failure to meet nutrition goals with an oral diet, oral highenergy beverages can be used. EN is used when necessary.

Pancreatic enzyme supplementation should not be routinely used in children with acute recurrent pancreatitis. These children should not have exocrine pancreatic insufficiency; if they do, they should receive a diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis and will need pancreatic enzyme supplementation.

## Chronic Pancreatitis

Children with chronic pancreatitis should be given a regular diet. In case of diabetes, children with chronic pancreatitis require a low-carbohydrate diet. ${ }^{2}$ Pancreatic enzyme supplementation is similar to supplementation for patients with CF (see chapter 12, "Cystic Fibrosis").

# Seizures and the Ketogenic Diet 

Jessica Ernst, MS, RDN, CSP, LD<br>Meredith Johnson, MS, RDN, CSP, LD

## Introduction

Ketogenic diet therapies (KDTs) are therapeutic interventions for the treatment of refractory epilepsy that have been in use since the 1920s. The diets are designed to mimic the biochemical response to starvation, in which ketone bodies rather than glucose become the main fuel for the brain's energy demands. Although the exact mechanism of action has never been fully elucidated, KDT has become an integral part of the management of refractory epilepsy. ${ }^{1,2}$

The use of KDT involves multiple health care team members who work collaboratively to ensure a successful transition to KDT, monitoring, and maintenance. Team members include the parents/caregivers, dietitian, neurologist, pharmacist, and other subspecialists to manage and monitor the cooccurring conditions and adverse effects that may occur. This chapter will focus on KDT management by the dietitian and demonstrate their role as an integral member of the multidisciplinary team.

## Types of Ketogenic Diets

--- page 435 ---

Ketogenic diets fall on a spectrum, with classic diets being the most restrictive and low glycemic index treatment diets being the least restrictive (Table 23-1). Ketogenic diet options frequently use ratios of grams of fat to nonfat (protein and net carbohydrates), whereas other variations use carbohydrate counting.

--- page 436 ---

# TABLE 23-1. Types of Ketogenic Diets 

| Type of <br> Diet | Description | Sample Meal |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Classic ketogenic diet | High ketogenic ratios (4:1, 3:1) <br> - More commonly used in infants, younger children, and those who require enteral nutrition <br> - Uses a gram scale to measure macronutrients for all nutritional intake and is very precise | 4:1, 400 cal <br> 30 g heavy cream, $36 \%$ <br> 20 g broccoli, raw <br> 28 g eggs (raw, mixed well) <br> 10 g cheese, Swiss <br> 17 g butter <br> 10 g olive oil <br> 3:1, 400 cal <br> 30 g heavy cream, $36 \%$ <br> 54 g broccoli, raw <br> 30 g eggs (raw, mixed well) <br> 10 g cheese, Swiss <br> 15 g butter <br> 10 g olive oil |
| Modified ketogenic diet | Lower ketogenic ratios (2:1, 1:1) <br> - More commonly used in adolescents and adults <br> - May use a gram scale and recipes for all nutritional intake or may rely on macronutrient tracking in which goals for macronutrients will be provided based on a calculated ratio | 2:1, 400 cal <br> 20 g heavy cream, $36 \%$ <br> 94 g broccoli, raw <br> 50 g eggs (raw, mixed well) <br> 12 g cheese, Swiss <br> 13 g butter <br> 10 g olive oil <br> 1:1, 400 cal <br> 20 g heavy cream, $36 \%$ <br> 173 g broccoli, raw <br> 65 g eggs (raw, mixed well) <br> 28 g cheese, Swiss <br> 5 g butter <br> 5 g olive oil |

| Type of <br> Diet | Description | Sample Meal |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| MAD | Relies on carbohydrate counting (either net or total carbohydrates) <br> - Net carbohydrates are calculated by subtracting grams of fiber from grams of total carbohydrates <br> - There are 2 options for carbohydrate reduction: <br> 1.

When selecting a ketogenic diet option for a patient, consider the following:

- Diagnosis (see Tables 23-2 and 23-3)
- Age (certain KDTs can provide greater benefit for specific age ranges)
- Feeding method (enteral, parenteral, by mouth, or a combination of feeding methods)
- Family desire for structure vs flexibility

# Indications for Diet Therapy Versus Contraindications 

Indications for ketogenic diets have been grouped into 2 categories by the International Ketogenic Diet Study Group ${ }^{2}$ : (a) those that are considered above average responders and (b) those that are reported to have average efficacy.

## Potential Adverse Effects

--- page 441 ---

All medical treatments for epilepsy can have side effects, including KDTs (see Table 23-4).

TABLE 23-4. Possible Adverse Effects of KDT

| Common | Sporadic | Rare |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Acidosis | Bruising | Cardiomyopathy |
| Constipation | Carnitine deficiency | Essential fatty acid deficiency |
| Reflux | Dehydration | Hunger |
|  | Diarrhea | Hypercalcemia |
|  | Elevated blood lipids | Hypoproteinemia |
|  | Excess ketosis | Increased infections |
|  | Feeding intolerance | Increased seizures |
|  | Food refusal | Irritability |
|  | Hypoglycemia | Medication toxicity |
|  | Kidney stones | Optic neuropathy |
|  | Lethargy | Osteoporosis |
|  | Low ketones | Pancreatitis |
|  | Nausea/vomiting |  |
|  | Slow growth |  |
|  | Weight loss |  |

# Suggested Treatment Recommendations for Most Common Adverse Effects 

The following are potential adverse effects that the health care team will need to address and advise an appropriate treatment plan based on the patient's individual needs.

1. Acidosis

- Signs and symptoms include dehydration, fatigue, and vomiting.
- Consider prescribing a bicarbonate and/or citrate buffer at initiation of classic ketogenic ratios.
o $1-2 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{kg}$ divided into $2-3$ doses daily.

--- page 442 ---

- Discuss with the health care team whether topiramate or zonisamide can be reduced or avoided as KDT in combination with these medications may put the child at higher risk of acidosis.

2. Constipation

- Ensure adequate hydration.
- Incorporate medium-chain triglyceride oil, avocados, or high insoluble fiber vegetables into the diet.
- The child may require additional medications, such as milk of magnesia, suppository, enema, or polyethylene glycol 3350.

3. Gastroesophageal Reflux (GER)

- Recommend smaller, more frequent meals.
- Children with GER will likely require an acid blocker reflux medication.


# Assessment and Nutrient Requirements 

## Pediatric Growth Assessment

Use the following guidelines for pediatric growth assessment:

- World Health Organization growth charts: $0-24$ months of age
- Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts: 2-20 years of age
- Use of body mass index (BMI) may not be useful for this population because many children have neurological disabilities; therefore, BMI may not be accurate. Consider using mid-upper arm circumference measurements instead.


## Estimating Nutrient Needs

Table 23-5 provides guidance on estimating nutrient needs, and Table 236 provides macronutrient composition of each diet in percent of total calories.

--- page 443 ---

# TABLE 23-5. Estimating Nutrient Needs 

| Energy | May use predictive equations, match energy intake to current estimated <br> intake, or estimate based on ideal body weight. Calories are controlled on <br> all ketogenic diets except the modified Atkins diets (unless needed). |
| :-- | :-- |
| Protein | Ensure minimum requirements for age are met. Continue to adjust protein <br> requirements with growth. A protein/energy ratio goal of 1.5 g protein/100 <br> kcal or higher is recommended to prevent growth retardation. ${ }^{\text {a }}$ |
| Fluid | Recommend using the Holliday-Segar method (see chapter 4, "Infant to <br> Adolescent") to calculate fluid requirements based on weight. Fluid <br> requirements may be higher or lower than this equation based on clinical <br> need (ie, increased fluid needs for prevention of constipation or kidney <br> stones). Fluids are not restricted for any ketogenic diet types. |

a $50 \%$ MCTs/21\% LCTs.

## Vitamin and Electrolyte Supplementation

--- page 444 ---

Vitamin and mineral supplementation is required for all types of medical ketogenic diets because of the high fat and low carbohydrate volume in the diet (see chapter 2, "Malnutrition," for specific requirements). The following nutrients are most commonly deficient in ketogenic diets:

- Vitamin $B_{1}$
- Vitamin D
- Magnesium
- Phosphorus
- Copper
- Zinc
- Selenium
- Carnitine ${ }^{3}$

Vitamin and mineral supplementation plans should be specific to the patient and their individual needs, but most children will need a multivitamin and vitamin D/calcium supplement while on a ketogenic diet. Salt or potassium supplementation may be needed based on calculated intake and laboratory results.

# Medication and Carbohydrate Content 

Many medications contain carbohydrates that may need to be calculated into a child's ketogenic diet plan. It is recommended that all medications be changed to the lowest carbohydrate form, which is often a pill or tablet formulation. It is important to include a clinical pharmacist on the team and aim for the carbohydrate content of medications to be less than 1000 mg of carbohydrates, if possible. To reduce exposure to higher carbohydrate content medications such as liquid suspensions, having a clinical decision support tool like an alert or flag can be useful in reducing prescribing errors. ${ }^{4}$

## Implementation and Nutrition Plan and Monitoring

Most ketogenic diets can be initiated at home or in the hospital. However, medical supervision is required for all diet starts. Baseline laboratory results should be obtained prior to initiation (see Table 23-7 for

--- page 445 ---

recommendations) and should then be obtained regularly during initiation.

# TABLE 23-7. Initiation Location 

| Location | Classic | Modified Ketogenic | Modified Atkins | MCT Oil | LGIT |

## Initiation Methods of Classic Ketogenic Diets

Table 23-8 provides initiation methods of classic ketogenic diets.

## TABLE 23-8. Classic KDT Initiation Methods

| Ratio- <br> Based | Strength-Based | Meal-Based |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| $1: 1 \rightarrow$ | $1 / 3$ ketogenic | Change 1 meal/d to goal ratio $\rightarrow$ change 2 meals/d to |
| $2: 1 \rightarrow$ | formula + | goal ratio $\rightarrow$ change 3 meals/d to goal ratio $\rightarrow$ all |
| $3: 1 \rightarrow$ | $2 / 3$ home formula | meals and snacks at goal ratio |
| $4: 1$ | $\rightarrow 2 / 3$ ketogenic |  |
|  | formula + |  |
|  | $1 / 3$ home formula |  |
|  | $\rightarrow$ goal ketogenic |  |
|  | formula |  |

Abbreviation: KDT, ketogenic diet therapy.

Note the following:

- Ketogenic diet formulas are more concentrated ( $\sim 1.5 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mL}$ ) than standard pediatric products ( $\sim 1 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mL})$; therefore, dilution of the ketogenic formula may be necessary.

--- page 446 ---

- In the intensive care unit, ketogenic diets are often initiated at the goal ratio, whereas calories are slowly titrated up.
- Outpatient (home) diet initiations are typically a slower induction process, making 1 change every week or more.


# Laboratory Monitoring Protocol 

Laboratory monitoring is important throughout the course of KDT to monitor for any abnormalities and trends (see Table 23-9). The laboratory monitoring protocols can be adjusted for each institution.

## TABLE 23-9. Laboratory Monitoring

| Frequency | Laboratory Measurement |
| :-- | :-- |
| Prior to <br> starting <br> KDT | Urine organic acids, complete metabolic panel, CBC with platelets, <br> liver profile, ionized calcium, magnesium, phosphate, fasting lipid <br> panel, 25-hydroxy vitamin D, free and total carnitine, selenium, zinc, <br> urinalysis including urine calcium and urine creatinine |
| Daily <br> during <br> initiation <br> phase | Complete metabolic panel, CBC with platelets, $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate |
| Every 3 mo <br> until stable | Complete metabolic panel, CBC with platelets, liver profile, <br> magnesium, phosphate, fasting lipid panel, 25-hydroxy vitamin D, free <br> and total carnitine, selenium, zinc, urinalysis including urine calcium <br> and urine creatinine |
| Every 12 <br> mo | DXA, EKG, renal ultrasonography |

Abbreviations: CBC, complete blood cell count; DXA, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry; EKG, electrocardiogram; KDT, ketogenic diet therapy.

## Ketone Measurements

Ketones are generally checked frequently during the initial period of the KDT (sometimes twice daily or every void) and are eventually spaced out once in the maintenance phase of the diet (see Table 23-10).

--- page 447 ---

TABLE 23-10. Ketone Measurements

| Measurement Type | Description |
| :--: | :--: |
| Blood ketones ( $\beta$ hydroxybutyrate) | - The most reliable and accurate form of ketosis <br> - Levels can be obtained from a home ketone meter with a single droplet of blood <br> - Testing recommended a few times/week at home, in the afternoon, until diet is stable <br> - Goal ketone level is $>3 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$; however, goal is individualized based on seizure control <br> - To convert results from $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ to $\mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$, divide by 10.41 |
| Urine ketones (acetoacetate) | - Hydration dependent and not as accurate as blood ketones <br> - Levels can be obtained from urinating on a urinalysis reagent strip <br> - Infants are low urine ketone excreters; therefore, not an accurate measurement of ketosis <br> - Goal is consistent with moderate to large urine ketones |
| Breath ketones (acetone) | - Noninvasive measurement <br> - Many external factors can negatively affect readings <br> - Expensive and not covered by insurance <br> - Not often used for the ketogenic diet with epilepsy |

# Sick Day Management 

When a child on a ketogenic diet is ill and unable to consume the prescribed diet plan, it is very important to maintain adequate hydration with sugar-free fluids, broths, or sugar-free gelatin. Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia (defined as a blood glucose $<50 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ) or excessive ketosis and provide small amounts of carbohydrate correction if needed, ensuring that all medications are in the lowest carbohydrate form.

If the patient can tolerate clear liquids, advance to a half-strength formula or half of a ketogenic diet meal without the added fat. Once the patient is tolerating this step, advance to a three-fourths strength formula mixture if enterally fed or add half the volume of fat back into the diet if orally fed. Once the patient is tolerating this step, advance back to the full ketogenic diet ratio.

--- page 448 ---

# Special Circumstances 

## Infants ${ }^{5}$

Initiation of KDT in all infants should occur in the hospital setting. The goal ratio is at least $3: 1$, with advancement to goal using a stepped approach. Monitor and adjust nutrient needs (calories, protein, fluid) accordingly based on growth, and evaluate the diet closely to meet micronutrient needs. Monitor the following:

- Blood glucose (minimum of twice daily) to watch for hypoglycemia
- Blood ketones twice daily (blood ketones are more accurate than urine ketones in infants)

Blood ketone and blood glucose monitoring can be decreased based on trends and provider discretion.

## Intensive Care Unit ${ }^{6}$

Ketogenic diets may be emergently started in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting for patients with the following diagnoses (among others, as determined by the medical team):

- New-onset refractory status epilepticus
- Febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome
- Super-refractory status epilepticus

Generally, classic diets are initiated at goal ratio (4:1) with $50 \%$ of calories that are titrated to goal. Higher ratios (such as 5:1) may be used temporarily. Indirect calorimetry is helpful for determining caloric goals. Continuous enteral feeds or parenteral nutrition may be needed, depending on clinical status. The dietary reference intake for protein should be provided at a minimum. Monitoring of urine ketones is not recommended in the ICU; check blood ketones if possible.

## Total Parenteral Nutrition ${ }^{7}$

Ketogenic total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is indicated when enteral feedings are not tolerated. The indication for starting ketogenic TPN is based on clinical condition. Electrolytes in the TPN solution should be

--- page 449 ---

adjusted based on clinical need. Dextrose limits are individualized per institution. Attempt to provide the least amount of dextrose possible. Some institutions may be able to compound with no dextrose included.

- Lipid infusion should start at $0.5-1 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{h}$ and be advanced by $0.5-1 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{h}$ daily until achieving the highest possible lipid infusion rate.
- Count the carbohydrate content of glycerol from the lipids when calculating the ketogenic ratio.
- Protein intake should be adequate for need based on the clinical condition.

Monitor laboratory measurements daily, specifically triglycerides (TGs), electrolytes, and bicarbonate. When interpreting TG results, consider whether the lipid infusion was running at the time of the blood draw. Adding carnitine supplementation to TPN is recommended.

# Discontinuing the Ketogenic Diet 

Significant variation of when and how quickly to discontinue diet therapy is based on the child's individual needs. ${ }^{8}$ Many institutions adhere to the recommendation of attempting the diet for a minimum of 3 months to allow time for fine-tuning and time for the diet to demonstrate effectiveness. If the diet is successful in reducing the child's seizure burden, most centers will start the weaning discussion after the child has been on the diet for 2 years. A plan for recurrence of seizures or worsening of seizures during the diet wean should be discussed with the child's ketogenic diet team. Some families may be hesitant to wean their child's KDT based on how beneficial it has been.

There has been a concern that weaning KDTs too quickly would cause a dramatic increase in seizures, but this is not supported by current literature. It is typically safe to make diet changes every $1-2$ weeks, but children may require a faster or slower wean depending on the circumstances. Table 23-11 provides a sample KDT weaning plan.

--- page 450 ---

# TABLE 23-11. Sample KDT Weaning Plan 

| Classic KDT: <br> Sample A | Classic KDT: <br> Sample B | Modified Atkins |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Starting point-4:1 <br> ratio | Starting point-4:1 <br> ratio | Increase carbohydrate restriction by 5 <br> g/wk |
| Step 1-3:1 ratio <br> Step 2-2:1 ratio <br> Step 3-1:1 ratio <br> Step 4-off | Step 1-3.5:1 ratio <br> Step 2-3:1 ratio <br> Step 3-2.5:1 ratio <br> Step 4-2:1 ratio <br> Step 5-1.5:1 ratio <br> Step 6-1:1 ratio <br> Step 7-off |  |

Abbreviation: KDT, ketogenic diet therapy.

## Short Bowel Syndrome

Anam Bashir, MD<br>Praveen S. Goday, MBBS

## Introduction

Pediatric intestinal failure is the reduction of functional intestinal mass below that which can sustain life, resulting in dependence on supplemental parenteral support for a minimum of 60 days within a 74 -consecutive-day interval. ${ }^{1}$ The most common cause of intestinal failure in children is short bowel syndrome (SBS). SBS is defined as less than $25 \%$ of the small bowel length predicted for gestational age (GA) or dependence on parenteral nutrition for more than 6 weeks after bowel resection. ${ }^{2}$ Causes of SBS include necrotizing enterocolitis, congenital atresia, volvulus, gastroschisis, or inflammatory bowel disease. The primary goal of management of SBS is to attain enteral autonomy. Management includes maintaining proper growth and development until patients can attain enteral autonomy. ${ }^{3}$ This can be achieved by supplementation of adequate nutrients, electrolytes, vitamins, and minerals and by providing substrate to the intestine to maintain intestinal health and promote intestinal adaptation. In this chapter, we will be reviewing the nutrition management of patients with SBS.

## Assessment and Nutrient Requirements

--- page 453 ---

Nutrition rehabilitation is key to promoting adaptation in children with SBS. Children with SBS are at risk for intolerance of enteral nutrition (EN), and a complete and thorough history and assessment is required to optimize their clinical status.

- History: Evaluation of intake (oral nutrition, EN, parenteral nutrition [PN]) and evaluation of output (stool output, ostomy output if [applicable], gastrostomy output)
- Physical exam: Anthropometrics (height/length, weight, weight for age, body mass index) and a nutrition-focused physical examination
- Laboratory assessment: Table 24-1 outlines the laboratory monitoring in patients with SBS.

TABLE 24-1. Laboratory Monitoring in Patients With Short Bowel Syndrome

| Laboratory Test | Monitoring on PN | Monitoring <br> on EN |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| CBC | On initiating PN, with every <br> change in PN, every 1-3 mo <br> while on PN | Every 6 mo |
| Iron studies | Every 3 mo | Every 6-12 <br> mo |
| TPN profile (electrolytes, serum <br> urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, <br> phosphorous, calcium, magnesium, <br> albumin, triglycerides) | On initiating PN, with every <br> change in PN, weekly until stable <br> PN; can be spaced out to every <br> 1-3 mo once on stable PN | Every 6 mo |
| Urine electrolytes/urine specific <br> gravity | On initiating PN, with every <br> change in PN, weekly until stable <br> PN; can be spaced out to every <br> 1-3 mo once on stable PN | Monthly if <br> indicated |
| Vitamin D | 3 mo after starting PN, then <br> every 3-6 mo | Every 6 mo |
| Vitamin B12 | Every 6 mo | Anatomy <br> dependent |
| Vitamins A, E, K | 3-6 mo after starting PN, then <br> every 3-6 mo | Anatomy <br> dependent |

Abbreviations: CBC, complete blood cell count; EN, enteral nutrition; PN, parenteral nutrition; TPN, total PN.

--- page 454 ---

In addition to these, the prothrombin time/partial thromboplastin time, copper, zinc, selenium, chromium, triene/tetraene ratio, and manganese can be monitored as indicated. ${ }^{4}$ Urine sodium should be checked in patients with high ostomy output and poor growth. Goal should be to maintain level more than $20 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L} .^{4}$

# Implementation of Nutrition Plan and Monitoring 

Maximizing enteral/oral feeds and lowering dependence on PN should be the goal of management in children with SBS. To do this, many factors need to be considered when implementing and monitoring the nutrition care plan for children with SBS.

## Nutrition Prescription

Daily energy intake of infants with SBS is most often higher than 100$140 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{kg}$ because of poor nutrient absorption. Daily fluid requirements for infants can be as high as $150-200 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ and older children may also have increased nutrient and fluid requirements.

The total energy needs are ultimately guided by gain in weight and length. PN energy needs are less likely to be increased because there is no thermic energy associated with digestion of food. PN fluid needs may be increased as per the stool or ostomy output. ${ }^{3}$

## Enteral Nutrition

EN should be started as soon as clinically appropriate after a resection. At the very least, minimal or trophic feeds are encouraged to maintain mucosal health. Oral feeds, in small volumes, should be encouraged to maintain oral skills.

Human milk is recommended in infants because it contains immunoglobulins, prebiotics, and growth factors, which help in intestinal adaptation. Donor breast milk can be used for preterm infants under 32 weeks' GA. If human milk is not available, formulas can be used. Amino acid-based formulas or extensively hydrolyzed formulas are

--- page 455 ---

preferred because children with SBS absorb nutrients better if they are broken down. ${ }^{2}$

# Mode of Feeds 

Feeds can be given as continuous, bolus, or a combination of both. Bolus feeds mimic physiologic feeds and should be trialed in low volumes. If not well tolerated, continuous feeds can be tried. An approach employing both bolus and continuous feeds (eg, continuous feeds overnight and bolus feeds through the day) can be used to gain the benefits of both. ${ }^{3}$

## Advancement of Enteral Nutrition

The volume of enteral feeds should be increased slowly to allow the intestine to adapt. Monitoring of the stool output, stool consistency, tolerance of feeds, and growth should guide this decision. Stool output should be maintained at around less than $40 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ or at a less than $50 \%$ increase from baseline. ${ }^{3}$ As enteral feeds are advanced, PN should be weaned accordingly to maintain total energy needs.

Solids can be introduced at 4-6 months of age. ${ }^{2}$ New foods should be introduced after 3-5 days to allow for assessment of tolerance. Fiber in the form of pectin, pureed green beans, and guar gum leads to the production of short-chain fatty acids in the colon that in turn can facilitate water absorption and help with stool losses.

- Pectin should be $3 \%$ of feed volume.
- Pureed green beans should be provided at 4 oz per 8 -oz formula, bringing the $30-\mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{oz}$ formula down to $22 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{oz}$.
- Guar gum should be provided at $20 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L}$.

There are some data indicating that patients older than 1 year of age can benefit from food-based formulas. However, they may need closer monitoring of their growth and micronutrient adequacy. ${ }^{2}$ A high-fat diet is preferred because it has a high energy content and promotes intestinal adaptation. Long-chain triglycerides (LCTs) are helpful for intestinal adaptation but require micelle formation, without which they are not absorbed well in the small intestine. Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs)

--- page 456 ---

are absorbed better, do not require micelle formation, and bypass the need for lymphatic continuity. The optimal source of fat is usually a combination of MCTs and LCTs. ${ }^{3}$

Limiting simple sugars like juices and fruits is a general rule because of osmotic diarrhea. Complex carbohydrates have a lower osmotic load and are better tolerated. ${ }^{3}$ See Table 24-2 for a list of simple and complex carbohydrates.

TABLE 24-2. Simple and Complex Carbohydrates

| Type of Carbohydrate | Source |
| :--: | :--: |
| Simple carbohydrates |  |
| Monosaccharides <br> - Glucose <br> - Galactose <br> - Fructose | Honey, fruit, fruit juice, maple syrup, agave nectar |
| Disaccharides <br> - Sucrose (glucose + fructose) <br> - Lactose (glucose + galactose) | Table sugar, milk |
| Complex carbohydrates |  |
| Polysaccharides <br> - Glycogen <br> - Amylose <br> - Amylopectin <br> - Soluble fiber <br> - Insoluble fiber | Potatoes, pasta, cereals, vegetables, whole fruits, seeds |

# Parenteral Nutrition 

PN is needed to support the partial or complete energy needs of patients with SBS until they achieve enteral autonomy.

--- page 457 ---

- Blended lipid injectable emulsions (ILEs; eg, soy, MCT, olive, fish oil-based ILEs) are preferred over the traditional soy oil-based ILE because of a lower risk of cholestasis and intestinal failure-associated liver disease (IFALD).
- Iron is not compatible with 3-in-1 PN preparations and needs to be given either orally/enterally or via intravenous iron infusions.
- Multivitamin and micronutrient additives are available based on the age and weight of the patient. (See chapter 6, "Parenteral Nutrition," for more details on specific products.)

PN can be started over 24 hours, but "cycling," which is the process of building in time off PN during every 24 -hour cycle, should be attempted once fluid status is stable. Cycling decreases the risk of IFALD, is more physiologic, and is easier for family functioning. Attempts to decrease PN and maximize dependence on EN should be the goal, which is guided by enteral tolerance, stool output, and growth of the patient. PN in infants with SBS increases the risk of IFALD. Frequently, patients can be weaned off PN but continue to need parenteral fluids for hydration and electrolyte imbalance.

During the transition period from PN to EN and after successful transition, patients are at risk of key micronutrient, vitamin, and mineral deficiencies. The most common deficiencies are of iron, copper, and fatsoluble vitamins. Other reported micronutrient deficiencies include those of vitamin $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{D}, \mathrm{E}, \mathrm{B}_{12}$, and zinc. Hence, there is a need for aggressive laboratory monitoring in patients during weaning from PN and the transition to EN even if they are growing well. ${ }^{5}$

## Weight Management and Obesity

Jessica Graumann, MS, RDN, LD

## Introduction

Childhood obesity continues to be an ongoing health problem affecting the United States, with 1 out of 5 children having obesity. ${ }^{1}$ Children and adolescents with obesity are more likely to have obesity as adults and are more at risk for what we have traditionally thought of as adult health problems, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and orthopedic issues. ${ }^{2-5}$ In addition, children and adolescents who have obesity experience psychosocial problems including depression, low self-esteem, and suicidal ideation because of being bullied for their weight. ${ }^{3},{ }^{5},{ }^{6}$

## Assessment and Nutrient Requirements

Anthropometrics should be assessed including height, weight, and body mass index (BMI). BMI is a method of assessing a person's body fat and the most common measure used to define obesity in children and adolescents. Although it is not a direct measurement of body fat, BMI for age correlates reasonably well with measurements of more direct methods. ${ }^{7,8} \mathrm{BMI}$ is calculated by using the following equations:

--- page 460 ---

$$
\text { BMI }=(\text { weight in kilograms/height in centimeters squared }) \times 10,000
$$

$$
\text { BMI }=(\text { weight in pounds/height in inches squared }) \times 703
$$

Anthropometrics including height, weight, and BMI are plotted on ageand sex-specific growth charts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ${ }^{9}$ The Expert Committee recommends using the following cutoffs for children $2-20$ years of age ${ }^{2}$ :

- Overweight: BMI between 85th and 94th percentile
- Obesity: BMI greater than or equal to the 95th percentile
- Severe obesity: BMI greater than the 99th percentile

A more specific classification divides obesity into 3 classes ${ }^{10,11}$ :

- Class I obesity: greater than or equal to the 95 th percentile
- Class II obesity: greater than or equal to $120 \%$ of the 95 th percentile
- Class III obesity: greater than or equal to $140 \%$ of the 95 th percentile

If a child has obesity, further evaluation is needed and should include a history assessment (Exhibit 25-1) and a physical examination (Exhibit 25-2). ${ }^{2,12,13}$

# EXHIBIT 25-1. History Assessment 

Weight History: Review the child's rate of weight gain and age at onset of obesity.
Diet History: This information helps to identify targets for change and should include information about eating patterns (timing, quality, location of meals/snacks), frequency of foods higher in calories and low in nutrition value (meals outside of home, sugar-containing drinks, snack foods like chips/cookies), and food preferences/dislikes. Energy intake/dietary patterns can be assessed using a combination of methods including 24-h recalls, food records, and food frequency questionnaires. ${ }^{a}$

Activity: Evaluate child's level of activity during structured (sports and physical conditioning) and unstructured play (time outside or walking to school). Also gather information about the child's sedentary behaviors, both recreational and educational.

--- page 461 ---

Sleep: Assess sleep habits including duration, quality, and schedule, as well as symptoms of sleep disorders.

Family History: Inquire about first- and second-degree relatives' history of obesity and common comorbidities of obesity, such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, liver or gallbladder disease, and respiratory problems.

## Implementation of Nutrition Plan and Monitoring

Although there are numerous diets available for the general public, scientific evidence shows weight loss for children and adolescents should include a reduced calorie intake through consumption of 5 or more servings of fruits and vegetables per day and the elimination of sugarsweetened beverages, as well as behavioral components such as the following ${ }^{14}$ :

--- page 463 ---

- Plan what to eat in advance.
- Eat 3 daily meals that are balanced.
- Do not skip meals.
- Make physical activity a daily part of the routine, aiming for more than $1 \mathrm{~h} / \mathrm{d}$.
- Decrease sedentary behavior, such as watching television and playing video games, to fewer than $2 \mathrm{~h} / \mathrm{d}$.
- Make physical activity fun and age-appropriate for each individual child.

A staged approach to weight management in children and adolescents is provided in Table 25-2. Specific weight loss goals are recommended depending on patient's age and BMI percentile as shown in Table 25-3.

# Diets Designed for Use in Children and Adolescents 

## Balanced-Macronutrient, Low-Kilocalorie Diet

Within a multicomponent weight management program, reduced calorie intake (no less than 1200 kcal ) in short-term and long-term durations for both children ages $6-12$ as well as adolescents has shown to be effective; however, without continual dietary intervention, weight regain is possible. ${ }^{15}$ The Institute of Medicine has specific sex formulas to calculate total energy expenditure (TEE) for youth who have overweight or obesity. This can be used as a starting point to determine a patient's energy needs for weight maintenance. ${ }^{16}$ If weight loss is recommended, goals need to be realistic and individualized.

Weight Maintenance TEE for Boys Ages 3-18 Years Who Are Overweight. To calculate the weight maintenance TEE, use the following equations:
(Recommended dietary allowance [RDA] for age and weight in $\mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{kg}$ $\times$ ideal body weight for height)/actual weight ${ }^{4}$

PA is the physical activity coefficient:

$$
\begin{gathered}
\text { PA }=1.00 \text { if the physical activity level (PAL) is } \geq 1.0 \\
\text { and }<1.4 \text { (sedentary) } \\
\text { PA }=1.12 \text { if PAL is } \geq 1.4 \text { and }<1.6 \text { (low active) } \\
\text { PA }=1.24 \text { if PAL is } \geq 1.6 \text { and }<1.9 \text { (active) } \\
\text { PA }=1.45 \text { if PAL is } \geq 1.9 \text { and }<2.5 \text { (very active) }
\end{gathered}
$$

--- page 466 ---

Weight Maintenance TEE for Girls Ages 3-18 Years Who Are Overweight. To calculate the weight maintenance TEE, use the following equations:

$$
\begin{gathered}
\text { TEE }=[389-(41.2 \times \text { age in years })] \\
+(P A \times[(15.0 \times \text { weight in kilograms })+(701.6 \times \text { height in meters })]) \\
P A=1.00 \text { if PAL is } \geq 1.0 \text { and }<1.4 \text { (sedentary) } \\
\text { PA }=1.18 \text { if PAL is } \geq 1.4 \text { and }<1.6 \text { (low active) } \\
\text { PA }=1.35 \text { if PAL is } \geq 1.6 \text { and }<1.9 \text { (active) } \\

# MyPlate 

MyPlate (https://www.myplate.gov/) was created to replace the Food Guide Pyramid and provide a guide for diet and exercise to help families make healthier food choices. Five food groups are illustrated using a plate and showing relational portions (see Table 25-4). ${ }^{17}$ The messaging emphasizes the following:

- Making half your plate fruits and vegetables
- Making at least half your grains whole grains
- Cutting back on sugary drinks and drinking more water

# Weight Loss Medications for Treatment of Pediatric Obesity 

Weight loss through lifestyle changes alone is ideal; however, it has been shown to be less effective, especially within the severe obesity category. ${ }^{19}$ The use of pharmacotherapy may be used in adjunctive therapy for a more aggressive treatment option within a tertiary care center. ${ }^{14}$

## Weight Loss Surgery

Because of lifestyle modifications having a modest effect on weight loss ${ }^{19}$, weight loss surgery needs to be seriously considered in the treatment for adolescents with severe obesity. The American Society of Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery has created guidelines for the selection of appropriate adolescent patients for weight loss surgery, seen in Exhibit 25-3. ${ }^{20}$ Although physical maturity such as Tanner staging and linear growth were previously used to determine suitability for weight

--- page 469 ---

loss surgery, no data has shown these measurements are affected negatively by weight loss surgery, and they should not be used to determine appropriateness for surgery. ${ }^{21}$

# EXHIBIT 25-3. Indications and Contradictions for Adolescent Weight Loss Surgery 

Indications for adolescent weight loss surgery:

- BMI $\geq 35 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m} 2$ or $120 \%$ of the 95 th percentile with a comorbidity (T2D, NAFLD, HTN, hyperlipidemia, OSA)
- BMI $\geq 40 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m} 2$ or $140 \%$ of the 95 th percentile

Contraindications for adolescent weight loss surgery:

- Medically correctable cause of obesity
- Ongoing substance use (within previous year)

# Diet Progression 

The diet advancement guidelines for weight loss surgery, including Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG), will vary by consistency, texture of food, and progression of amount of food eaten at each meal, as shown in Table 25-6. ${ }^{22}$

# Micronutrient Needs for Adolescents 

There is a potential for deficiencies after weight loss surgery; therefore, adolescents will need to take a daily vitamin and mineral supplement regimen. Annual nutrition-related laboratory tests should be obtained to evaluate that a patient's individual supplement needs are met. Ensure the following standard supplementation regimen for RYGB and SG patients ${ }^{22,23}$ :

--- page 473 ---

- Multivitamin-multimineral supplement
- Thiamin: 1.2 mg for male patients and 1.1 mg for female patients
- Folic acid: $400 \mu \mathrm{~g}$ for male and female patients
- Iron: 8 mg for male patients, 18 mg for female patients
- Copper: $900 \mu \mathrm{~g}$ for male and female patients
- Vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$
- Dosage: $350-500 \mu \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{d}$ as an oral, sublingual, or nasal supplement or $1000 \mu \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mo}$ intramuscularly
- Calcium
- Dose: 1200 mg
- Calcium citrate or carbonate and should include Vitamin D
- Vitamin $\mathrm{D}_{3}$
- Dosage: $3000 \mathrm{IU} / \mathrm{d}$
- Elemental iron
- Dosage: iron in multivitamin possibly sufficient for some patients (males); 45$60 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ possibly needed for menstruating female patients


# Monitoring 

Follow-up with the child or adolescent is essential to monitor and evaluate change. Data that can be monitored and evaluated could come from anthropometric measurements, food- and nutrition-related history, biochemical data, medical tests and procedures, and physical nutritionfocused findings. Follow-up between a provider and patient within 1 week to 1 month is ideal. Within stage 1, "Prevention Plus" or stage 2, "Structured Weight Management," monthly follow-ups are recommended, whereas weekly follow-up appointments for $8-12$ weeks and subsequent monthly follow-ups are recommended for a patient within stage 3, "Comprehensive Multidisciplinary Intervention."2,14

## Consensus Recommendations

Consensus Recommendations answer questions for which the level of evidence in the literature did not support any GRADE-level recommendations. These documents address questions about a nutrition practice topic using weaker supporting literature and expert opinion and consensus recommendations as well as identify areas for future research. These recommendations are not clinical guidelines as defined by ASPEN. The need to deliver practice information to clinicians, even when it is of a consensus nature from practice experts, remains an important role of ASPEN.
