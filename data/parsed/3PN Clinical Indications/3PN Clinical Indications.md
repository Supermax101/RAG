# Timing of PN Initiation 

- Important consideration for clinical outcomes
- Typically, early nutrition favored
- reverse macronutrient deficits
- prevent worsening malnutrition
- Emerging evidence suggests in ICU settings delayed PN initiation ( $\leq 1$ week) may be acceptable
- Pediatric Guidelines
- Preterm infants; PN should be started promptly after birth
- If EN nutrition is not anticipated to be sufficient, PN should be started within
- 1-3 days in infants
- 4-5 days in older children

# Indication: Intestinal Failure 

"Intestinal failure (IF) is the reduction of functional intestinal mass below that which can sustain life, resulting in dependence on supplemental parenteral support for a minimum of 60 days within a 74 consecutive day interval"

AKA:

- Inability to maintain hydration
- Inability to absorb sufficient calories and or electrolytes

# Intestinal Failure Characterization

|  Subtype | Presentation
Timing | Speed of
Onset | Locality of
Disease | Pathology | Duration  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Type 1 | Acquired | Acute | GI and
systemic | Benign and
malignant | $<28$ days  |
|  Type 2 | Congenital /
acquired | Acute | GI and
systemic | Benign and
malignant | Weeks to
months  |
|  Type 3 | Congenital /
acquired | Chronic | GI and
systemic | Benign and
malignant | Months to
years  |
