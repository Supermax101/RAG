# SELF-ASSESSMENT \#1, CONT. 

Upon admission to the hospital and continuation of PN, what change should be made based on RK's ABG?
A. Initiate mechanical ventilation
B. Increase chloride salts in the PN
C. Increase acetate salts in the PN
D. Decrease calorie content of PN

## GENERAL PRINCIPLES - PH

- The degree of acidity in the blood
- Acidity of the blood is based on the hydrogen ion $(\mathrm{H}+)$ concentration
- pH is maintained at $7.40(7.35$ to 7.45$)$
- Associated disorders
- Acidosis: lead to $\mathrm{pH}<7.35$
- Alkalosis: lead to $\mathrm{pH}>7.45$

--- page 5 ---

# GENERAL PRINCIPLES - H+ 

- Regulation via 3 mechanisms
- Chemical buffering by extracellular and intracellular mechanisms
- Control of $\mathrm{pCO}_{2}$ in the blood by the lungs via alterations in the rate and depth of ventilation
- Control of the serum $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$concentration by alterations in renal $\mathrm{H}+$ excretion and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$reabsorption

Al-Jaghbeer M, Kellum JA. Nephrol Dial Transplant. 2015; 30:1104-11.

## GENERAL PRINCIPLES - BUFFERS

- Most abundant ECF buffer
- Carbonic acid/bicarbonate system

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}+\mathrm{CO}_{2} \longleftrightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3} \longleftrightarrow \mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-} \\
& \text {Carbonic acid Bicarbonate }
\end{aligned}
$$

- $\sim 15,000 \mathrm{mmol} \mathrm{CO}_{2}$ produced daily from fat and carbohydrate metabolism
- Lungs eliminate to prevent buildup of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$
- Other buffers: plasma proteins, hemoglobin, phosphates

--- page 6 ---

# ACID-BASE GENERAL PRINCIPLES 

- Described by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation
- $\mathrm{pH}=6.1+\log \left(\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right] /\left(0.03 \times \mathrm{pCO}_{2}\right)\right)$
- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$
- Base component
- Calculated from arterial pH and $\mathrm{pCO}_{2}$
$-\mathrm{pCO}_{2}$
- Acid component
- Measured in serum

Ayers P et al. JPEN J Parent Enteral Nutr. 2012; 36:18-23.

## ARTERIAL BLOOD GAS (ABG)

- Laboratory analysis that reflects the ability of the lungs to oxygenate blood
- $\mathrm{pH} / \mathrm{pCO}_{2} / \mathrm{pO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$

|  | Normal ABG values |
| :-- | :--: |
| pH | $7.40(7.35-7.45)$ |
| $\mathrm{pCO}_{2}(\mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg})$ | $40(35-45)$ |
| $\mathrm{pO}_{2}(\mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg})$ | $80-100$ |
| $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}(\mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L})$ | $24(22-26)$ |

# ADDITIONAL FORMULAS 

| Disorder | Compensatory Response |
| :-- | :-- |
| Acute Respiratory Acidosis | $1 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ increase in $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$for every 10 mm Hg rise in $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ |
| Chronic Respiratory Acidosis | $3 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ increase in $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$for every 10 mm Hg rise in $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ |
| Acute Respiratory Alkalosis | $2 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ decrease in $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$for every 10 mm Hg fall in $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ |
| Chronic Respiratory Alkalosis | $4 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ decrease in $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$for every 10 mm Hg fall in $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ |

## MIXED DISORDER

- When two or more primary acid-base disorders occur simultaneously
- Suspect if blood gas values are inappropriate for compensation

--- page 11 ---

# SELF-ASSESSMENT \#2 

A patient presents with a metabolic acidosis due to septic shock. Which ABG pattern fits this disorder?
A. Decreased pH , decreased $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$
B. Decreased pH , increased $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$
C. Increased pH , increased $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$
D. Increased pH , decreased $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$

- Consumption or accumulation of acids $\left(\mathrm{H}_{+}\right)$
- Pulmonary compensation
- Increase respiratory rate

--- page 12 ---

# ANION GAP (AG) 

- Estimates the difference between measured and unmeasured major ECF cations and anions
- $\mathrm{AG}=\mathrm{Na}+-\left(\mathrm{Cl}^{-}+\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right)$
- Normal AG $=3-11 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$
- $\mathrm{AG}>17-20 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ indicates accumulation of unmeasured anions
- $\mathrm{AG}>20-25 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ indicates significant organic acidosis
- 1:1 ratio between anions in blood
- Normal AG: Every $1 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L} \uparrow$ in $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$should result in $1 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L} \downarrow$ in $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$
- Elevated AG: Every 1-point $\uparrow$ in AG should result in $1 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L} \downarrow$ in $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$

In accordance with our accreditor’s Standards of Integrity and Independence in Accredited Continuing Education, ASHP requires that all individuals in control of content disclose all financial relationships with ineligible companies. An individual has a relevant financial relationship if they have had a financial relationship with ineligible company in any dollar amount in the past 24 months and the educational content that the individual controls is related to the business lines or products of the ineligible company.

An ineligible company is any entity producing, marketing, re-selling, or distributing health care goods or services consumed by, or used on, patients. The presence or absence of relevant financial relationships will be disclosed to the activity audience.

The following persons in control of this activity’s content have relevant financial relationships:

- Phil Ayers: Fresenius Kabi, consultant and speaker
- David Evans: Fresenius Kabi, consultant and speaker; Abbott Laboratories, consultant and speaker; CVS/OptionCare, consultant; Alcresta, consultant and speaker
- Andrew Mays: Fresenius Kabi, speaker
- Jay Mirtallo: Fresenius Kabi, consultant

All other persons in control of content do not have any relevant financial relationships with an ineligible company.

As required by the Standards of Integrity and Independence in Accredited Continuing Education definition of ineligible company, all relevant financial relationships have been mitigated prior to the CPE activity.
