# SELF-ASSESSMENT \#1 

A 54-year-old thin female ( $51 \mathrm{~kg}, 5^{\prime} 5^{\prime \prime}$ ) with a history of short bowel syndrome requiring her to be on long-term PN for the past 10 years is informed by her homecare pharmacy there is a national shortage of IV multivitamins. Which of the following doses of IV multivitamins would be MOST appropriate to use in this patient?
A. Continue same 10 mL daily dose until the supply is exhausted
B. Only provide 10 mL on Mondays each week
C. Only provide 10 mL on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays each week
D. Switch to standard dose of oral multivitamin 3 days per week

## SELF-ASSESSMENT \#2

A 69-year-old diabetic male with bowel obstruction from colon cancer is to be sent home on PN. During the cycling of his PN in the hospital, he has required 30 units of regular insulin to be added to his PN to maintain glucoses in the 130-150 mg/dL range. One week after discharge, his caregiver reports his finger stick glucose readings have been in the $60-80 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ range. What is the most likely reason for the change in his glycemic control?
A. Stress of being hospitalized has resolved and his insulin needs are lower.
B. His HPN formulation was incorrectly compounded with less dextrose than in the hospital.
C. He is not receiving his HPN daily as instructed.
D. He has received more insulin than prescribed.

# STRATEGIES FOR MANAGING PN PRODUCT SHORTAGES 

- PN product shortages have occurred since 1988
- Mostly isolated to IV multivitamins
- Deaths from thiamine deficiency resulting in refractory lactic acidosis
- 2010-2011 shortages resulted in almost every PN component used
- FDA regulations, inspections, recalls, issues with raw materials, demand, loss of manufacturing sites and quality issues
- Substitute PN products must be evaluated for compatibility/stability with other ingredients in PN admixtures. Carefully identify therapeutic equivalents:
- Communicate information to clinical staff
- Prioritize patients and manage inventory

Holcombe B et al. Nutr Clin Pract. 2018; 33(1):53-61.

## MANAGING PN PRODUCT SHORTAGES - AMINO ACIDS

- Amino acids shortage strategies:
- Reserve high (e.g., > 10\%) concentration amino acids for fluid-restricted PN patients
- Review entire portfolio of amino acids products available nationally
- Other concentrations may be available (e.g., 8.5\%)
- Different brands of amino acids products are not always substitutable
- Different pH , calcium-phosphate solubility, amounts of phosphate and other electrolytes (e.g., sodium, acetate, chloride)
- Compound in a single, central location to decrease inventory waste
- Evaluate need for each amino acid product on ACD

--- page 5 ---

# MANAGING PN PRODUCT SHORTAGES - ILE 

- ILE shortage strategies:
- Prioritize supply of soybean oil ILE
- Hospitalized patients on PN for $>2$ weeks
- Home or long-term patients on PN
- 100 g weekly for EFAD prevention
- Critically ill patients on PN receiving propofol do NOT require additional ILE for EFAD prevention
- Propofol is formulated in 10\% soybean oil ILE
- Consider using an alternative ILE containing soybean oil
- Monitor PN patients for risk of developing EFAD

Plogsted S et al. Nutr Clin Pract. 2017;32(3):427-29.

## MANAGING PN PRODUCT SHORTAGES - ELECTROLYTES

- Electrolytes and minerals shortage strategies:
- Consider switching to oral or enterally administered electrolyte or mineral supplement products when feasible
- Malabsorption syndromes or nonfunctional Gl tract may preclude use
- Reserve IV electrolyte and mineral products for patients requiring PN
- Therapeutic medical need for IV electrolyte and mineral products
- Reconsider use of serum electrolyte algorithms or protocols in asymptomatic patients to conserve inventory
- Assess PN patient population to determine if a standardized, commerciallyavailable PN product with electrolytes would be appropriate

--- page 6 ---

# MANAGING PN PRODUCT SHORTAGES - MULTIVITAMINS 

- IV Multivitamin shortage strategies:
- Reserve for patients receiving solely PN or therapeutic medical need
- Ration to dosing 3 times a week to conserve inventory
- Monitor for vitamin deficiencies during rationing
- Complete shortage - use individual thiamine, ascorbic acid, pyridoxine, folic acid, cyanocobalamin, vitamin K
- Consider switching to oral or enterally administered multivitamins when feasible
- Review vitamin profile of each product to be used for completeness
- Higher doses may be required in malabsorption syndromes

Plogsted S et al. Nutr Clin Pract. 2016; 31(4):556-9.

## MANAGING PN PRODUCT SHORTAGES - TRACE ELEMENTS

- IV trace elements shortage strategies:
- Reserve for patients receiving solely PN or therapeutic medical need
- Ration to dosing 3 times a week to conserve inventory
- Complete shortage - use individual zinc, selenium, copper
- Monitor for trace element deficiencies
- Consider switching to oral or enterally administered multitrace supplements when feasible
- Review trace element profile of each product to be used for completeness
- Higher doses may be required in malabsorption syndromes

# APPRAISINGPN COMPATIBILITY ISSUES 

- Determine final concentrations:
- Dextrose 16\%, Amino Acids 5.5\%, ILE $2.3 \%$
- 206 mEq Sodium/L
- 99 mEq Potassium/L
- 305 mEq/L of monovalent cations
- 45 mmol Phosphate/L
- 7 mEq Magnesium/L
- 6 mEq Calcium/L
- 13 mEq/L of divalent cations
![img-1.jpeg](images/7e769049cfe1aac8.png)


## APPRAISINGPN COMPATIBILITY ISSUES, CONT.

- It is recommended that TNAs maintain final concentrations of monohydrated dextrose $\geq 10 \%$, amino acids $\geq 4 \%$, ILE $\geq 2 \%$ to be more likely to remain stable for up to 30 hours at room temperature $\left(25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ or for 9 days refrigerated $\left(5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ followed by up to 24 hours at room temperature
- Current TNA formulation meets these recommendations
- Sodium content is recommended to have a maximum of $150 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$
- Current TNA has 206 mEq sodium/L
- Also exceeds recommended 1-2 mEq/kg/day at 5.6 mEq sodium/kg/day
- Potassium content recommended is 1-2 mEq/kg/day
- Current TNA provides 2.7 mEq potassium $/ \mathrm{kg} /$ day

--- page 8 ---

# APPRAISINGPN COMPATIBILITY ISSUES, CONT. 

- Commercially available ILEs are stabilized with egg yolk phosphatides providing a mechanical and electrical barrier to particle coalescence
- Phospholipid mixture imparts negative surface (anionic surfactant) charge on emulsified lipid particles and prevents coalescence by inducing electrostatic repulsion
- Addition of cations to a TNA neutralize the negative charge on the surface of the lipid particles and lead to loss of the electrostatic and mechanical barrier created by the anionic surfactant
- Monovalent $=$ Sodium + Potassium
- Divalent $=$ Magnesium + Calcium
- Trivalent $=$ Iron dextran (greatest impact on destabilization)

Boullata Jlet al. JPEN J Parenter Enteral Nutr. 2014; 38(3):334-77.
Driscoll DF et al. AmJ Health-Syst Pharm. 1995;52:623-34.

## APPRAISINGPN COMPATIBILITY ISSUES, CONT.

- Commercially available ILEs may exhibit the following characteristics:
- Creaming occurs when the electrostatic barrier is neutralized
- Single lipid droplets form aggregates and migrate to surface of the TNA
- Described as dense white color at the top of a TNA
- Heavy creaming occurs prior to "cracking" where the oil globules coalesce on the surface and separates from water in the TNA
- Unsafe for infusion if heavy creaming or "cracked" marbled appearance in TNA visible
- Oil globules $>5$ microns in size pose the risk of pulmonary embolism

--- page 9 ---

# APPRAISINGPN COMPATIBILITY ISSUES, CONT. 

- Commercially available ILEs are heavily influenced by the cations and may lead to lipid destabilization
- $305 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ of monovalent cations with Sodium and Potassium
- Ranges in the literature have been up to $150 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$
- This TNA requires reformulation with a lower sodium and potassium concentration
- $13 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ of divalent cations with Magnesium and Calcium
- Ranges in the literature have been up to $20 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$
- This TNA contains reasonable amounts of divalent cations

Boullata Jlet al. JPEN J Parenter Enteral Nutr. 2014; 38(3):334-77.
Driscoll DF et al. AmJ Health-Syst Pharm. 1995;52:623-34.

## STABILITY CONCERNS FOR 2-IN-1 PN VS. TNA

- Separate infusion of a commercially available ILE may be required in patients requiring higher combined dosages of monovalent, divalent and trivalent cations
- Dual chamber bags may also be required in the home setting
- Unstable TNAs may only reveal visual evidence of "cracked" oil droplets 65\% of the time
- Visual assessment is only available in most pharmacies
- Light obscuration analysis can detect unstable TNAs 90\% of the time
- Not routinely available
- Use of inline filter becomes life-saving
- 1.2 micron filter recommended for use with a TNA

--- page 10 ---

# STABILITY CONCERNS FOR 2-IN-1 PN VS. TNA, CONT. 

- TNA vs. PN with Intermittent ILE
- Oil-in-water emulsion cracking more likely to occur at $\mathrm{pH} \leq 5$
- Addition of monohydrated dextrose ( $\mathrm{pH} \sim 4$ ) directly to an ILE ( pH 6-9) can contribute to instability
- Amino acids are considered to provide a protective effect by enhancing the TNA's buffering effect and reducing probability of coalescence
- ILEs do not possess pH buffering capacity
- Hydrolytic degradation of triglycerides forming free fatty acids can lower the pH over the course of an ILE shelf life
» Minimal hydrolysis occurs at a pH of 6.5-7

Driscoll DF, et al. AmJ Health-SystPharm1995;52:623-34.

## DETERMINING CALCIUM-PHOSPHATE COMPATIBILITY IN PN

- Dextrose 16\%, Amino Acids 5.5\%, ILE 2.3\%
- 45 mmol Phosphate/L
- 6 mEq Calcium/L
- Appears to be compatible; however this Calcium-Phosphate compatible curve was based upon stability at $5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 24 hours followed by $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 24 hours
- Affected by pH , temperature, order of mixing, agitation, calcium salt used, storage time, visual opacity

--- page 11 ---

# FDA SAFETY ALERT OF APRIL 1994 

- January 1994
- 2 patients died suddenly after receiving peripheral TNA
- Clinical diagnosis was pulmonary embolus
- Both autopsies revealed amorphous deposits of calcium-phosphate in the pulmonary vasculature
- Hospital switched from Travasol to FreAmine III
- FreAmine III contains 10 $\mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ of phosphate
- Retrospective review identified 5 patients (out of 50 who received the TNA)
- Bilateral interstitial infiltrates
- 4 of 5 died within a median of 48 hrs on the TNA

Shay DK et al. Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol. 1997; 18:814-7.

## UNDERSTANDING CALCIUM PHOSPHATE COMPATIBILITY IN PN

| Form | pKa | Aqueous Solubility |
| :-- | :--: | :-- |
| Monobasic $-\mathrm{CaH}_{2} \mathrm{PO}_{4}$ | 2.12 | $18 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L}$ |
| Dibasic $-\mathrm{CaHPO}_{4}$ | 7.21 | $0.3 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L} \Leftrightarrow$ Problem with PN |
| Tribasic $-\mathrm{Ca}_{3}\left(\mathrm{PO}_{4}\right)_{2}$ | 12.67 | Insoluble |

Application of Henderson-Hasselbach equation
\% ionized $=100 /[1+$ antilog $(\mathrm{pKa}-\mathrm{pH})]$

- Travasol 10\%; pH 5.86
$\%$ ionized $=100 /[1+$ antilog $(7.2-5.86)]=4.4 \%$
- FreAmine III 10\%; pH 6.68
$\%$ ionized $=100 /[1+$ antilog $(7.2-6.68)]=23.2 \%$

# PH EFFECTS OF AMINO ACIDS IN PN 

![img-3.jpeg](images/cde9d52a313f2b90.png)

## DETERMINING CALCIUM-PHOSPHATE COMPATIBILITY IN PN, CONT.

- Guidelines
- Use established Calcium-Phosphate solubility curves for specific amino acids
- Consider Phosphate from ALL sources including amino acids
- Use Calcium Gluconate, avoid Calcium Chloride
- Add Phosphate salts early in compounding sequence, Calcium toward end
- Consider PN volume at time Calcium is added
- Periodically agitate, check for visual precipitation in PN
- Store at appropriate temperature
- Use appropriate in-line filter (1.2 micron)

# IMPORTANCE OF IN-LINE FILTRATION OF PN 

- Mean droplet size of commercially-available ILE is between 0.2-0.5 microns
- Particulates are common in most large volume injectables
- Foreign particles can produce phlebitis
- Peripheral $>$ central venous access
- Microprecipitates may lead to catheter occlusion
- Solubility of calcium \& phosphate is not entirely predictable
- 1.2 micron in-line filter will reduce these problems and can filter microorganisms (e.g., Candida albicans)
- Should be used for no longer than 24 hours

- Patient and/or caregiver will be able to learn what needs to be done, including:
- Catheter care, HPN preparation, HPN administration, IV pump management
- Most patients 'cycle at night'
- Frequent urination may impede sleep cycle
- Can the patient physically carry the HPN bag around their residence?
- Compliance issues (e.g., Are they really following the daily infusions?)
- Restarts upon hospital discharges
- Discarding expired HPNs
- End of life issues (or when do we stop HPN)


## DELIVERY/STORAGE ISSUES FOR HPN EDUCATION

- Patients may not be at their permanent residence for a number of reasons
- Unable to care for themselves independently
- Amount of storage space needed for ancillary drugs (e.g., $0.9 \% \mathrm{NaCl}$ flushes) and supplies
- Temporary living areas (e.g., hotel or recreational vehicle) limited
- Amount of refrigerated space needed for HPN formulations and additives (e.g., IV multivitamins)
- Access to full size refrigerator
