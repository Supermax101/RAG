1,,In which of the following cases should PN be initiated?,mcq_single,"A. Term infant with gastroschisis | B. 1-month-old former 26-week preterm infant with abdominal distension and portal venous air on abdominal x-ray | C. 3-month-old former 26-week preterm infant with a chylothorax | D. 35-weeks’ gestational age (GA) preterm infant in septic shock secondary to group B Streptococcus (GBS) sepsis | E. Newborn preterm infant on a planned feeding advance of GI priming and ,30 mL/kg/day increase due to intermittent feeding intolerance | F. All of the above",F,F is correct.,PN is indicated when full enteral nutrition cannot be achieved and may be particularly useful in catabolic conditions.,Practical Parenteral Nutrition Workbook chapter 6
2,,Which intervention would be the LEAST likely next access attempt for a newborn infant who lost their peripheral line while receiving stock PN and trophic feeds?,mcq_single,A. Insert a new peripheral intravenous line (PIV) | B. Place a umbilical venous catheter (UVC) | C. Surgically place a catheter (Broviac or Hickman) | D. Place a percutaneous inserted central catheter (PICC),C,C is correct.,"A new PIV should be attempted, especially because it is usually easy to insert a new PIV. However, it is only appropriate for short-term access. A UVC, the least painful and invasive central access, could be attempted in a newborn infant if the umbilical vein is patent. UVCs have increased infection risk after 1 to 2 weeks. If a UVC placement is unsuccessful and longer term access is sought, a PICC line would be the next option and is appropriate for longer term access. The last, and most invasive option, would be a surgically centrally placed (Broviac or Hickman) catheter. Although infection risk is low, it is highly invasive with placement and removal requiring a surgeon. Therefore it would only be considered once all other options are exhausted or it is known that an infant will require very long-term access. See Table 6.2 for additional differences in peripheral and central access.",Practical Parenteral Nutrition Workbook chapter 6

At 1 hr of age, the infant’s plasma glucose concentration is 36 mg/dL. A stock PN of 10% dextrose and 3% amino acids is being infused through the UVC. Antibiotics were ordered after blood cultures were obtained.",Which of the following statements regarding PN and enteral neonatal nutrition is FALSE?,mcq_single,"A. Normal fetal metabolic and growth rates and nutritional requirements stop with birth, precluding routine use of IV nutrition | B. The smaller and more preterm and less developed the infant, the less body stores (protein, fat, and glycogen) are available to provide nutrients for metabolic needs. | C. The metabolic—and thus the nutrient—requirements of the newborn are equal to or greater than those of the fetus of the same gestational age. | D. First-week protein and energy intakes are associated with improved 18-month developmental outcomes in preterm infants.",A,A is false and the correct answer.,"PN is important right after birth because normal fetal metabolic and growth rates and nutritional requirements do not stop with birth. Furthermore, the smaller and more preterm, the less body stores (protein, fat, and glycogen) are available to provide nutrients for metabolic needs. Intravenous feeding is always indicated when normal metabolic needs are not met by enteral feeding. Additionally, the metabolic and nutrient requirements of the newborn are equal to or greater than those of the fetus of the same gestational age. Thus the newborn infant should receive the same nutrition as the fetus of the same gestational age to maintain normal metabolism and growth. PN is particularly important to ensure full protein and energy supplies to maintain neuronal development. First week protein and energy intakes are associated with improved 18-month developmental outcomes in preterm infants, as well as greater adult lean body mass and higher resting energy expenditure.",Practical Parenteral Nutrition Workbook chapter 6
4,"A 750 g AGA preterm infant is born following a 26-week gestation by C-section due to preterm, premature rupture of membranes and incompetent cervix. The resuscitation is unremarkable and the infant is placed on CPAP 6 cm H2O at 35% Fio2 following surfactant administration in the delivery room. At 1 hr of age, the infant’s plasma glucose concentration is 36 mg/dL. A stock PN of 10% dextrose and 3% amino acids is being infused through the UVC. Antibiotics were ordered after blood cultures were obtained.",Which of the following statements regarding Stock PN and protein and glucose supply is TRUE?,mcq_single,"A. Stock PN solutions containing 10% dextrose and 3% amino acids can be stored in the neonatal pharmacy indefinitely. | B. At an infusion rate of 80 mL/kg/day, commonly formulated stock PN solutions provide adequate short-term dextrose and amino acid supplies. | C. There is no need to continue to measure the plasma glucose concentration as the infant is receiving IV dextrose. | D. There is no need to check electrolytes or calcium and phosphorous concentrations until the second or third day of life when enteral feeding is started.",B,B is correct.,"Stock PN solutions can be stored in the pharmacy for immediate use, but like all pharmaceuticals, they cannot be stored indefinitely. A common stock PN mixture is 10% dextrose and 3% amino acids. At 80 mL/kg/day, this solution would provide 5.5 mg/kg/min of glucose (see Table 6.3 for calculations), which is appropriate for most preterm neonates. Because individual infants vary in response to dextrose infusions, one should always monitor the infant’s glucose concentration frequently to ensure that normal values are maintained. This standard stock PN mixture will provide 2.4 g/kg/day of amino acids, still less than the 3.5–4 g/kg/day of amino acids that are needed in very preterm infants to restore in utero protein accretion and body growth (see Table 6.4). Stock PN solutions often are not supplemented with calcium and phosphorous salts, but both should be added to a customized PN within the 1st 24 to 48 hours. Plasma calcium and phosphorous as well as routine electrolytes should be measured within the 1st 24 hours as electrolyte disturbances are commonly observed after very preterm birth.",Practical Parenteral Nutrition Workbook chapter 6
5,A 28-week gestation infant is born weighing 1.1 kg. Stock PN with 10% dextrose and 3% amino acids is started upon delivery at 80 mL/kg/day.,How many nonprotein calories and how much protein are provided by this stock PN and will this be enough energy and protein to prevent protein breakdown in this infant?,mcq_single,A. 27 kcal/kg/day and 2.4 g/kg/day | B. 40 kcal/kg/day and 3 g/kg/day | C. 22 kcal/kg/day and 4 g/kg/day | D. 160 kcal/kg/day and 2 g/kg/day,A,A is the correct.,"10% dextrose has a dextrose concentration of 10 g/100 mL. At an infusion rate of 80 mL/kg/day, it provides 27 kcal/kg/day (80 ml/kg/day 3 10 g/dL ÷ 100 3 3.4 kcal/g of glucose 5 27 kcal/kg/day). 3% amino acids has an amino acid concentration of 3 g/100 mL. At an infusion rate of 80 mL/kg/day it provides 2.4 g/kg/day of amino acids. At least 1.5 g/kg/day of parenteral amino acids is necessary to prevent significant protein breakdown (catabolism). Thus while the energy from just the dextrose infusion may be insufficient to promote full utilization of the 2.4 g/kg/day of amino acids for net protein balance, it is sufficient, along with the amino acid infusion, to prevent protein breakdown.",Practical Parenteral Nutrition Workbook chapter 6
6,A 28-week gestation infant is born weighing 1.1 kg. Stock PN with 10% dextrose and 3% amino acids is started upon delivery at 80 mL/kg/day.,Which of the following statements about IV dextrose infusion is FALSE?,mcq_single,"A. IV dextrose infusion should provide 30% to 50% of total caloric intake if no enteral feeding is provided. | B. Excess IV dextrose infusion intake increases the incidence and severity of hyperglycemia. | C. Glucose intolerance and hyperglycemia does not occur at glucose infusion rates ,10 mg/kg/min. | D. The glucose utilization rate is 2 to 4 mg/kg/min in term infants and 4 to 6 mg/kg/min in very preterm infants.",C,C is false and the correct answer.,"The normal glucose utilization rate is 2 to 4 mg/kg/min in term infants and 4 to 6 mg/kg/min in very preterm infants. These rates provide 30% to 50% of total caloric intake if no enteral feeding is provided. IV dextrose above these rates is the principal cause of neonatal hyperglycemia, but other conditions contribute to this problem, making it common. Many of these infants also have stress-induced catecholamine, cortisol, and glucagon surges that suppress insulin secretion and promote glycogen breakdown and gluconeogenesis and reduce peripheral insulin and glucose sensitivity. Excessive dosing of IV lipids also aggravates hyperglycemia by providing competitive lipid carbon for oxidation and by producing cofactors in the liver from beta-oxidation of fatty acids that promote the regulatory enzymes in the gluconeogenic pathway. Most preterm infants and term infants continue to produce glucose from their liver at about 2 to 3 mg/kg/min. Furthermore, hepatic glucose production, even in preterm infants, is not easily suppressed by high glucose or insulin concentrations. If the parenteral dextrose infusion rate is .5 to 7 mg/kg/min, then total glucose utilization capacity will be exceeded, resulting in progressively increasing glucose concentrations. Increasing glucose infusion rate (GIR) above 8 to 10 mg/kg/min almost always contributes to hyperglycemia, which has many adverse consequences, including increased CO2 production, lipogenesis, and development of a fatty liver with inflammation and steatosis. Glucose intolerance can occur in preterm infants even at a GIR of 6 mg/kg/min or lower, especially when glucose is infused without amino acids. Coinfusion of amino acids can reduce glucose concentrations and the incidence of hyperglycemia, as amino acids increase insulin secretion and promote anabolism (protein synthesis and protein balance) that requires energy production from glucose oxidation. Absence of enteral nutrition also contributes to the pathogenesis of hyperglycemia by limiting production of gut incretins, which stimulate insulin secretion. Infants of extremely low birth weight (ELBW) are very susceptible to hyperglycemia, further aggravating the overall nutritional status of these fragile infants. Reducing the GIR by coinfusing a lower dextrose fluid, reducing total fluids overall, or advancing feeds are effective ways to normalize glucose levels.",Practical Parenteral Nutrition Workbook chapter 6
7,"A 28-week gestation infant is born weighing 1.1 kg. Stock PN with 10% dextrose and 3% amino acids is started upon delivery at 80 mL/kg/day. On day 2, customized PN is ordered; 10% dextrose is continued, but amino acids are increased to 4 g/kg/day and intravenous lipids are started at 2 g/kg/day.",Which of the following statements about PN amino acid practice is TRUE?,mcq_single,"A. Starting with higher amino acid intakes of 3 g/kg/day administered in the first few days of life is safe and decreases the incidence of extrauterine growth restriction. | B. Current PN amino acid mixtures provide optimal amino acid supplies and plasma concentrations of all essential and nonessential amino acids for very preterm infants. | C. Providing more amino acids, even above requirements, will improve growth and neurodevelopmental outcomes. | D. Only 3% amino acid solutions should be used to prevent osmotic injury to blood vessels and red blood cells.",A,A is correct.,"The energy provided should meet the basal metabolic rate plus the energy cost of growth and losses (gastrointestinal, urinary, skin, others). To achieve a growth rate of 15 to 20 g/kg/day, the preterm infant requires 110 to 130 kcal/kg/day enterally. When all nutrition is PN, 90 to 100 kcal/kg/day should meet the growth needs, because there is no energy spent for digestion and absorption, and fecal losses are minimal. Energy losses are minimized by the use of a controlled thermoneutral environment and fluid losses are ameliorated by the use of humidification (which are further reduced by humidification of inhaled air/oxygen gases with assisted ventilation). See Table 6.3 to calculate the caloric content of PN solutions.",Practical Parenteral Nutrition Workbook chapter 6
8,"A 28-week gestation infant is born weighing 1.1 kg. Stock PN with 10% dextrose and 3% amino acids is started upon delivery at 80 mL/kg/day. On day 2, customized PN is ordered; 10% dextrose is continued, but amino acids are increased to 4 g/kg/day and intravenous lipids are started at 2 g/kg/day.",Which of the following statements about protein requirements in this newborn infant is CORRECT?,mcq_single,A. Preterm infants should receive 2 to 2.5 g/kg/day of protein when receiving PN. | B. Protein intakes of 4 to 4.5 g/kg/day are recommended for preterm infants with slow weight gain. | C. The protein requirements of preterm infants are greater than those of term infants. | D. Protein intakes .3.5 g/kg/day may result in high uric acid and creatinine levels.,C,C is correct.,"Current pediatric amino acid solutions were initially formulated to meet the requirements of infants and children and provide a plasma amino acid profile similar to that of term 30-day-old breastfed infants. As such, they contain insufficient amounts of many amino acids, particularly essential and conditionally essential amino acids. It is fundamental that during fetal life, fractional growth rate and fractional protein synthetic rates, which determine amino acid requirements, decline with gestation. Fetal animal studies and the factorial method for assessing fetal protein requirements in human infants at 24 to 30 weeks’ gestation show that 3.6 to 4.8 g/kg/day of amino acids support the more rapid growth at these early gestational ages. The average value of 4 g/kg/day is recommended as the guideline for infants after birth but of the same gestational age as the rapidly growing normal human fetus. At later gestational ages, less protein (amino acids) is needed; for example, 2.5 to 3.5 g/kg/day between 30 to 36 weeks and 1.5 to 2 g/kg/day at term (which is the amount provided by full breast feeding of mature mother’s milk). These manufactured solutions contain essential amino acids and conditionally essential amino acids such as tyrosine and taurine. The delivery of gestational age–appropriate amounts of amino acids along with adequate energy results in positive nitrogen balance and a decrease in loss of body weight, thereby reducing time to regain birth weight. It is estimated that, in the absence of exogenous intake, endogenous protein losses are 0.5 to 1 g/kg/day for infants receiving only dextrose in the infusion. Protein should provide 8% to 10% of total calories; providing more than 10% of the gestational age–appropriate amount of protein is unnecessary and does not increase net protein accretion or body growth rate.",Practical Parenteral Nutrition Workbook chapter 6

Starting with higher amino acid intakes of 3 g/kg/day administered in the first few days of life is safe and decreases the incidence of extrauterine growth restriction. | B. Current PN amino acid mixtures provide optimal amino acid supplies and plasma concentrations of all essential and nonessential amino acids for very preterm infants. | C. Providing more amino acids, even above requirements, will improve growth and neurodevelopmental outcomes. | D. Only 3% amino acid solutions should be used to prevent osmotic injury to blood vessels and red blood cells.",A,A is correct.,"Early introduction of amino acids in PN is safe, results in a positive nitrogen balance, and improves glucose tolerance, most likely by increasing insulin and IGF-1 secretion and enhancing protein synthesis that requires glucose for energy. More recent studies reveal that starting with higher amino acid intakes of 3 g/kg/day administered in the first few days of life is safe and decreases the incidence of extra uterine growth restriction. Answer B is incorrect, because current IV amino acid solutions were not developed to provide optimal individual amino acid delivery for newborn infants, including very preterm infants, infants with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), and especially infants with early postnatal physiologic and biochemical instability. Answer C is incorrect because the imbalance in plasma essential, conditionally essential, and nonessential amino acids provided in current neonatal IV amino acid solutions is not improved by simply increasing the IV amino acid intake (infusion) rate. Perhaps as a result of these limitations, there is only limited evidence that increased IV amino acid supply during the first days after birth improves growth or neurodevelopmental outcomes. Instead, neurodevelopment is improved when greater amounts of amino acids (and total protein when milk feedings are added) are given with higher amounts of energy, both carbohydrate and lipid. Maintaining the gestational age–appropriate protein intake supports brain growth as measured by head circumference and subsequent magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, even into adolescence. Commonly accepted recommendations for preterm infants are shown in Table 6.4, although there is considerable variability among NICUs in this practice. Intakes of amino acids higher than 4 g/kg/day right after birth have not been shown to further enhance protein balance, even in extremely preterm infants born between 23 and 28 weeks’ gestation who require the higher amino acid and protein intakes for optimal growth. Answer D is incorrect because up to 5% amino acid solutions can be infused slowly through central venous catheters when concentrating PN to avoid overhydration and hyperglycemia.",Practical Parenteral Nutrition Workbook chapter 6
10,"A 28-week gestation infant is born weighing 1.1 kg. Stock PN with 10% dextrose and 3% amino acids is started upon delivery at 80 mL/kg/day.

IV lipid emulsions must be started at 0.5 g/kg/day. | B. Excess IV lipids often produce hypertriglyceridemia, a sign of reduced plasma lipid clearance. | C. IV lipids produce carbon competition with glucose for oxidation, contributing to hyperglycemia. | D. Advancing IV lipids to 3 to 3.5 g/kg/day is important for providing nonprotein calories for achieving positive energy balance and supporting protein synthesis and net protein balance. | E. IV lipid emulsions do not contain sufficient amounts of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) to meet normal fetal accretion of this essential polyunsaturated fatty acid (LCPUFA).",A,A is false and the correct answer.,"IV lipid emulsions can be started at higher rates, up to 2.5 to 3.5 g/kg/day, but the most common practice is to start at about 1 to 2 g/kg/day and advance by 0.5 to 2 g/kg/day (slower rates for smaller, more preterm infants, faster rates for larger, less preterm infants) each day up to 3 to 3.5 g/kg/day. Answer B is true, as many preterm infants—especially those born extremely preterm and of extremely low birth weight—have limited lipoprotein lipase activity (and other lipases), limiting their capacity for plasma lipid clearance. Although many use an upper limit of 200 to 250 mg/dL for serum triglyceride concentrations, there is no specific pathology associated with high levels of triglycerides, and they only indirectly indicate that oxidative metabolism of fatty acids released by lipases from triglycerides might be limited. Answer C is true because IV lipids can release sufficient amounts of fatty acids that produce carbon competition with glucose for mitochondrial oxidation, contributing to hyperglycemia. Similarly, hyperglycemia from excess IV dextrose infusion rates and other processes limit fatty acid carbon oxidation and their beneficial effect on energy balance. IV lipid emulsions do not, however, contain carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT), the enzyme necessary for transporting long chain fatty acids into mitochondria for oxidation. Milk and preterm formulas do contain reasonable amounts of CPT, indicating that IV nutrition with lipids requires some enteral feeding to allow sufficient fatty acid oxidation for achieving positive energy balance. Answer D is true because advancing IV lipids to 3 to 3.5 g/kg/day is important for providing nonprotein calories, for achieving positive energy balance, and supporting protein synthesis and net protein balance. Answer E is true. IV lipid emulsions do not contain sufficient amounts of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) to meet normal fetal accretion of this essential polyunsaturated fatty acid (LCPUFA). Even fish oil–based IV lipid emulsions, which do contain some DHA, do not contain enough DHA to produce normal fetal DHA deposition rates. Fetal white adipose tissue accumulation during last trimester of n-3 fatty acid is about 45 to 65 mg/day (mostly as 22:6n-3, or DHA). A 1 kg preterm infant fed human milk containing 3.7 g fat/dL with 0.2% to 0.4% fatty acids as 22:6n-3 (DHA) at an enteral feeding volume of 180 mL/kg/day would receive only 13 to 25 mg 22:6n-3 DHA/day, clearly below normal in utero accretion rates. Preterm infants fed increased 22:6n-3 DHA may have higher visual acuity, particularly at 2 and 4 months, and improved Bayley mental development and MacArthur Communicative inventories at 12 months, but longer term studies have not shown a clear benefit to any aspect of neurodevelopment of supplemental DHA. Thus the current diet for preterm infants is deficient in this essential fatty acid, but the long-term significance of this deficiency is not known, nor is how these infants would develop if fed to sufficiency.",Practical Parenteral Nutrition Workbook chapter 6
11,"A 29-week gestation infant is on 6 cm H2O CPAP with 30% Fio2 and is breathing 50 to 60 breaths per minute without signs of respiratory distress. The infant is on stock PN, with a new custom PN providing 4 g/kg/day of amino acids, 10% dextrose, and lipids at 2 g/kg/day ordered for this evening. Enteral feedings are started with unsupplemented donor milk at 20 mL/kg/day with a plan to advance by 30 mL/kg/day after 3 days of trophic feeds.",Which of the following is correct?,mcq_single,"A. The amino acid/dextrose/lipid infusion amounts should be decreased in amounts equivalent to the advanced enteral feeding nutrient amounts. | B. PN infusion rates plus enteral feeding volumes should be adjusted to maintain 4 g/kg/day protein intake, plasma glucose concentrations between 54 and 106 mg/dL (3–6 mmol/L), and plasma triglyceride concentrations <250 mg/dL. | C. The amino acid infusion rate should be decreased to 2 g/kg/day to avoid uremia (elevated blood urea nitrogen [BUN]), hyperammonemia, toxic amino acid concentrations, and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. | D. Total energy intake should be increased to 120 or more kcal/kg/day to meet the protein intake of 4 g/kg/day, using the ratio of 30 kcal per g protein for all protein intake rates.",B,B is correct.,"It is important to maintain the necessary protein and energy intakes required for growth as PN is reduced and enteral feedings are advanced. Maintaining sufficient protein and energy intake and meeting the needs for metabolism and growth are essential, but individual nutrients should be adjusted to ensure normal plasma nutrient and metabolic product concentrations. Answer A is incorrect, because this will lead to under nutrition as donor milk does not have sufficient protein to maintain normal protein balance and promote growth if IV amino acid infusion rates are decreased too quickly. Not uncommonly, PN is often reduced abruptly to allow for removal of central lines or because of poor peripheral IV access. However, this can produce a period of several days when there is inadequate protein and energy intake. Answer C is incorrect. Some clinicians have raised concerns about the adverse effects of higher early amino acid infusion rates on neurodevelopment because of the possibility of causing hyperaminoacidemia, metabolic acidosis, uremia, and hyperammonemia, but most studies have not shown such adverse outcomes. In fact, BUN concentrations and ammonia concentrations should both increase slightly with increased amino acid infusion rates if the amino acids are appropriately oxidized and producing ammonia and the liver is functioning well to remove ammonia through the urea cycle. There is little correlation between plasma BUN and ammonia concentrations and amino acid infusion rates in the acceptable range. Abnormally high amino acid concentrations generally are the result of excessive and unnecessary infusion rates (>4 g/kg/day) and limited urinary urea excretion. Caution should be used in giving high amino acid infusion rates to infants with impaired liver or renal function from hypoxic-ischemic injury that prevents ammonia detoxification by the damaged liver and urea and ammonia excretion by the damaged kidney. In contrast, the most common metabolic complication of IV amino acid solutions is lower than needed plasma concentrations of essential and some conditionally essential amino acids, as well as unbalanced amino acid concentrations, which together will limit anabolism and net protein balance. Furthermore, there are many examples of improved morbidities with optimal amino acid infusion rates. For example, a lower incidence of chronic lung disease has been reported in infants receiving higher intakes (4 g/kg/day) than in those receiving 3 g/kg/day, but whether this is due to improved lung growth directly from the amino acids or from amino acid production of IGF-1 is uncertain. Answer D is incorrect, because the protein-to-energy ratio is curvilinear; that is, there is not a fixed protein-to-energy ratio across the range of metabolizable, nonprotein energy intakes. It should be underscored that nitrogen retention increases with increasing energy intake up to about 80 to 90 kcal/kg/day, but at higher energy (caloric) intakes, there is no increased gain in net protein balance. The latter is achieved only with greater protein intakes. At low energy intakes, more energy improves protein balance, but greater amounts of energy, from both carbohydrate and lipid, above the amount needed for protein balance only contribute to greater fat accretion (see Table 6.3).",Practical Parenteral Nutrition Workbook chapter 6

Amino acid concentrations in standard IV amino acid solutions are balanced toward nonessential amino acids. | B. IV glutamine is required to promote protein balance and reduce infections. | C. Cysteine may be added to daily PN mixtures because it is a conditionally essential amino acid in extremely preterm infants that may be important during rapid growth periods. | D. Carnitine should be added to all PN solutions starting on day 1 and continued as long as the infant is receiving PN regardless of enteral feeding advancements of milk or formula.,C,C is correct.,"Cysteine may be considered an essential amino acid in preterm infants, especially in infants less than 33 to 34 weeks’ gestation, particularly during rapid growth. Cysteine is important for protein accretion and is added as cysteine hydrochloride 40 mg/g amino acid (not to exceed 100 mg/kg/day). Because the cysteine is added as a hydrochloride acid, it will lower the pH of the infusate and increase solubility of calcium and phosphorous. Cysteine is added at the time of compounding due to stability issues. Answer A is incorrect because the ideal PN solution for preterm infants is unknown. Currently, three formulations are available in the United States, and data to date do not allow firm conclusions of superiority of one over the other. Pediatric formulations used for preterm and term neonates contain higher concentrations of branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, valine) and decreased amounts of methionine and phenylalanine due to their potential toxicity at very high concentrations (not seen with current solutions infused at customary rates). Neonates have additional amino acids that are considered conditionally essential (tyrosine, glutamine, arginine, cysteine, glycine, proline, and perhaps citrulline), but many of these are not provided in sufficient amounts to maintain overall normal metabolic, protein balance, and growth rates. Tyrosine is not present in these solutions but may be added as N-acetyl tyrosine, although there is no proven advantage to growth or metabolic conditions with this form of tyrosine. Answer B is incorrect. Glutamine, the most abundant amino acid in plasma and human milk, is not included in PN solutions because of decreased solubility. However, supplementation of glutamine in preterm infants has not been shown to improve mortality, rates of sepsis, or length of NICU stay. Therefore IV glutamine supplementation is not currently recommended; rather, it is provided with enteral feeding of milk or formula. Answer D is incorrect. Carnitine is another essential amino acid not included in available neonatal IV amino acid solutions. It is provided in human milk and has been added to preterm formulas. It is important for transport of long chain fatty acids across the inner mitochondrial membrane in all cells, making fatty acids available for energy production. Plasma levels decline without dietary supplementation. It is an accepted additive for long term PN (>2 weeks) when it does appear to increase hepatic cytosolic beta oxidation of long chain fatty acids. However, there is no evidence that even with this cytosolic oxidation there is improved energy balance or protein accretion.",Practical Parenteral Nutrition Workbook chapter 6

Exclusive soybean oil IV lipid emulsions contain all of the required fatty acids, antiinflammatory products, and lack inflammatory substances such as phytosterols. | B. Phytosterols are important for lipid solubility and thus should be added to all IV lipid emulsions. | C. Fish oil (exclusive or partial) IV lipid emulsions have a higher n-3/n-6 ratio, which may have antiinflammatory properties that reduce parenteral nutrition–associated cholestatic liver disease (PNALD) and contribute to improved developmental outcomes. | D. Use of IV lipid emulsions with mixtures of oils has been proven to improve outcomes.",C,C is correct.,"Exclusive fish oil–based lipid emulsions provide DHA, relatively large amounts of alpha-tocopherol, and no phytosterols (Table 6.5). An exclusive fish oil product (Omegaven®) is available in the United States under compassionate-use and research protocols only. It usually is given in combination with other lipid emulsions to provide a more balanced mix of fatty acids. n-3 fatty acids or very long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (VLCPUFA) such as DHA have beneficial effects on the developing brain and retina and may be considered conditionally essential in preterm infants. Studies have demonstrated that the use of the fish oil emulsion can reverse or at least ameliorate hepatic dysfunction in infants and children with PNALD, but the quantity of fish oil emulsion required has not been determined, and variation in response among large numbers of subjects remains untested. Answer A is incorrect. Lipid emulsions, derived mainly from soybean and safflower oil, contain neutral triglycerides, glycerol, and phospholipids for emulsification. The most commonly used emulsion in the United States is soybean oil derived. It has no DHA and little alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E, as an antiinflammatory substance), and it contains medium chain fatty acids and large amounts of phytosterols. Answer B is incorrect. Phytosterols have been associated with Kupffer cell activation and inflammation, leading to hepatic injury and cirrhosis. Their elimination from nonsoybean oil IV lipid emulsions may be as or more important in preventing or ameliorating PNALD than the benefits assumed for fish oil and other short (oleic) and long chain polyunsaturated essential fatty acids (specifically, DHA) or antiinflammatory substances such as alpha-tocopherol. Answer D is incorrect. It is weighted to linoleic n-6 long chain fatty acids, producing a higher n-6/n-3 fatty acid ratio. Mixed soybean, olive, and fish oil–based emulsions containing medium chain fatty acids, alpha-tocopherol, significant amounts of DHA, and decreased amounts of n-6 PUFAs are available in Europe, and one has recently been introduced in the United States (Smoflipid®). It does contain phytosterols but in amounts much lower than the exclusive soybean oil product. To date there is no consistent evidence that the mixed-oil emulsions improve specific outcomes, particularly as the amount and duration of IV lipid emulsion use is diminishing with earlier and faster advancement of enteral feeding of milk.",Practical Parenteral Nutrition Workbook chapter 6

Sodium is not needed during the first few days of life. All infants are born with an expanded extracellular fluid space and increased total body sodium content. The postnatal diuresis is responsible for removing fluid and ridding the body of excess sodium. A delayed diuresis or provision of maintenance sodium in the first few days of life has been associated with an increased risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Furthermore, most ill or physiologically unstable preterm infants receive significant amounts of sodium in arterial line solutions and drugs such as ampicillin and heparin. Potassium should be added to the PN after the diuresis has been established. Many NICUs add calcium to the first PN solutions, although there is limited rational evidence for this practice other than perhaps to preserve myocardial contractility. The risk of adding calcium without phosphorus is significant, however, as calcium supplement alone increases the risk of hypophosphatemia.",Practical Parenteral Nutrition Workbook chapter 6

No changes,C,C is correct.,"Sodium and potassium are within normal limits and infant is meeting required amounts (see Table 6.6). The diuretic phase should be completed and the infant should no longer be wasting bicarbonate in the urine. Therefore the focus needs to be changed to administering more chloride in the PN and IV fluids. Acetate and chloride intakes are generally considered in terms of ratios/percentages.

In this scenario, the PN would have delivered 2.7 g/kg/day of amino acids compared with 4 g/kg/day when concentrated. Nutrition delivery can be greatly improved by concentrating PN. However, care must be taken to avoid providing excessive nutrients when combined with advancing enteral nutrition. There are also limitations to what can be compounded into small PN volumes.

This can be achieved by manipulating infusion rates and/or dextrose concentrations to lower the GIR by 1 to 2 mg/kg/min. Advancing enteral feedings will promote production of incretins from the gut which increase insulin production. Answer A is incorrect because lowering to 3% dextrose decreases GIR to <4 mg/kg/min and risks hemolysis due to hypotonicity. Answer B is incorrect because increasing amino acids may help insulin secretion but will not lower glucose quickly.

D.Premature infants who receive donor milk demonstrate similar rates of weight gain as those who are fed premature formula.",A ,A is the correct option,"Pasteurized donor milk is recommended if mother’s own milk is unavailable. Donors are screened and milk is pasteurized to minimize infection risk. However, donor milk (often from term mothers) has lower protein content than preterm milk. Pooling (3–5 donors) reduces variability, sometimes adjusted for caloric/protein targets. Studies show protein often <1 g/dL and energy <15 kcal/oz. Pasteurization reduces beneficial bioactive components (macrophages, neutrophils, secretory IgA, lactoferrin, lysozyme) though fatty acids remain stable, with DHA/ARA levels lower than maternal milk. HMOs are preserved, but their clinical impact remains uncertain. Donor milk protects against NEC, but weight gain is slower compared to formula-fed infants.

Potassium is not added in the first customized PN solution. Specifically, potassium acetate is none and potassium chloride is none.
Sodium is provided because the addition of sodium in the first customized PN solution is usually based on what is considered standard IV fluids for a DOL 2 neonate. To provide a total of 2 mEq/kg/d sodium, an additional sodium acetate of 1.3 mEq/kg/d is selected. Sodium chloride is none.
Magnesium is not added because BGJ’s magnesium is currently elevated at 2.7 mg/dl after receiving 4 g of IV magnesium sulfate during delivery for neuroprotection. Therefore, magnesium sulfate is none.
Calcium is provided because it is extremely important for BGJ to maintain optimal calcium for bone accrual and cardiac function. Calcium gluconate is included at 1.5 mEq/kg/d.",
84,same,What other additives would you include in the first patient-specific PN order?,q_and_a,,,,"Common additives in neonatal PN solutions include the following:
a. Cysteine: Cysteine is a conditionally essential amino acid in neonates and infants because of the enzymatic immaturity of the transsulfuration pathway responsible for conversion of methionine to cysteine and then ultimately taurine. Cysteine is not found in commercially available amino acid products because of stability concerns. The addition of cysteine provides an added benefit of decreasing the pH of the PN solution further to allow for improved calcium and phosphate solubility. For this reason, some institutions add cysteine to PN at a ratio of 40 mg for every gram of amino acids.
b. Heparin: Heparin is typically added at 0.25–1 unit/ml of PN solution for solutions infusing through central venous catheters (CVCs). In neonates, this process maintains the patency of the catheter, given the extremely low flow rates of these solutions and the small diameter of the catheter. Some institutions will consider removal of heparin from these solutions if the flow rate is sufficient to maintain the patency of the catheter (eg, 10 ml/h).
c. Carnitine: Carnitine transports long-chain fatty acids across the mitochondrial membrane for oxidation and energy production and is an important addition to PN solutions for patients <32 weeks’ GA. Carnitine accrual occurs almost exclusively during the third trimester of pregnancy, so extremely premature neonates who are not receiving adequate EN are at risk for deficiency without supplementation. Carnitine is typically added to PN solutions at 5–20 mg/kg/d if no enteral intake of human breast milk or formula is provided and especially if the infant is expected to be on PN longer than 14 days.
d. Multivitamins: Pediatric multivitamins should be included in customized PN solutions at 2 ml/kg/d for infants <2.5 kg and 5 ml/d for infants ≥2.5 kg.
e. Trace elements: None of the currently commercially available multi–trace-element products contain the appropriate amounts of each of the standard trace elements. For this reason, the ASPEN Novel Nutrient Task Force recommendations6 for pediatric trace elements in this population is to add them as individual components as follows (see also Appendix B, Table B-25). Note that more recent European recommendations supported by ASPEN recommend slightly higher doses of zinc (500 mcg/kg/d), copper (40 mcg/kg/d), and selenium (7 mcg/kg/d) in premature infants.7 These higher amounts are starting to be used in clinical practice in the United States:

i.   Zinc: 400 mcg/kg/d (if weight is <3000 g)
ii.  Copper: 20 mcg/kg/d
iii. Manganese: 1 mcg/kg/d (Note that some groups do not add manganese because of manganese contamination from other PN components, the risks of toxicity, and the lack of deficiency observed in patients.)
 iv. Selenium: 2 mcg/kg/d
  v. No addition of chromium",
85,same,What follow-up laboratory test results might be important to obtain for the following day?,q_and_a,,,,"Laboratory tests in extremely premature neonates can be very challenging because of the limited circulating blood volume. For this reason, the determination to order testing is carefully assessed. In the case of BGJ, she will most likely need sodium, potassium, chloride, carbon dioxide, BUN, serum creatinine, glucose, calcium, albumin, phosphorus, triglycerides (TG), and blood glucose level (from meter, because BGJ has an in-line blood-sampling device through which a glucose-containing PN solution is currently infusing) in the next 24–48 hours.",
86,"
In the past 48 hours, BGJ has received an increase in her enteral nutrition, which consists of mother’s breast milk (MBM) with a backup of donor breast milk (DBM). Her umbilical arterial catheter (UAC) and umbilical venous catheter (UVC) have been removed, and a single-lumen peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line has been placed in her right upper extremity. The tip of the PICC has been confirmed as central by x-ray. BGJ has been receiving the initial parenteral nutrition (PN) prescription that was written two days ago, and repeat laboratory tests were conducted this morning.
A PICC line was placed in the right upper extremity after the removal of the UAC and UVC. BGJ continues to receive caffeine, but her antibiotics were discontinued after her initial blood culture remained negative at 36 hours. There have been no changes in her IV fluids. She began receiving breast milk at 1 ml every 3 hours, and today this will be advanced to 1.5 ml every 3 hours.
Her current weight is 0.510 kg.
Over the past 24 hours, BGJ’s total fluid intake was 54.1 ml. She has not taken any oral feeds. Her orogastric/nasogastric intake was 8 ml, given as 1 ml every 3 hours. Her intravenous intake totaled 46.1 ml, which consisted of 40.8 ml of PN and 5.3 ml of ILE.
Her total output was 23 ml plus one stool. This included 20 ml of urine and 3 ml from the NG/G-tube. There were no drains, no ostomy output, and stool was passed once.
On abdominal examination, her abdomen was round and soft with positive bowel sounds.

Sodium phosphate: 1 mmol/kg/d
Potassium phosphate: None
Potassium: BGJ’s potassium is WNL and is most likely lower than the actual laboratory result. This is related to BGJ now needing to have blood collected via heel sticks, given the loss of her UAC. These samples are often hemolyzed, which falsely elevates the potassium level. (Note that most laboratories indicate hemolysis of the sample within the result comments.) Given this normal value, the potential for a hemolyzed sample, and BGJ’s adequate urine output (~1.6 ml/kg/h), BGJ’s potassium in her PN solution should be increased to the standard provision of 2 mEq/kg/d. However, given BGJ’s current decreased chloride value and increased carbon dioxide value, changing from potassium acetate to potassium chloride would be recommended. Therefore, potassium should be provided as 2 mEq/kg/d potassium chloride.
Potassium acetate: None
Potassium chloride: 2 mEq/kg/d
Sodium: Premature infants have increased rates of sodium clearance via their urine. Additionally, they have increased sodium needs, which are not meet by breast milk. Given BGJ’s decreased sodium level, the recommendation would be to increase her total sodium to 3–4 mEq/kg/d. By increasing the sodium phosphate in the PN script, 1.33 mEq/kg/d sodium is provided by the provision of 1 mmol/kg/d sodium phosphate. The remaining 1.7–2.7 mEq/kg/d sodium should come from either sodium chloride or sodium acetate. Given BGJ’s decreased chloride value and improved carbon dioxide value, adding some sodium chloride would be appropriate, but one should not remove all the sodium acetate because premature infants have increased losses of acetate due to renal excretion.9 For this reason, the recommendation would be to provide sodium acetate at 1.3 mEq/kg/d and to add 1.4 mEq/kg/d sodium chloride to provide a total of 4 mEq/kg/d sodium.
Sodium acetate: 1.3 mEq/kg/d
Sodium chloride: 1.4 mEq/kg/d
Magnesium: Given BGJ’s decreased magnesium level and the lack of magnesium in her current PN solution, magnesium should be added at the standard amount of 0.3 mEq/kg/d.

To advance BGJ’s PN solution on the following day, check a blood glucose level tomorrow morning to see if it is WNL and whether advancing BGJ’s GIR to provide more calories would be appropriate.",
92,"Patient Clinical Information:
During the past week, BGJ’s enteral nutrition has been advanced, and she is currently receiving mother’s breast milk and donor breast milk at 5 ml every 3 hours, primarily donor breast milk due to a decreased supply of mother’s milk. Parenteral nutrition volume has been reduced as feeding volume advanced, and the amino acid and electrolyte content has been reduced to allow compounding into a smaller PN volume and to complement the protein and electrolytes received from the enteral feedings. Today’s laboratory test results show a low hemoglobin and hematocrit, so the plan is to transfuse BGJ with 10 ml per kilogram of packed red blood cells given in two aliquots 12 hours apart. Because of concerns about necrotizing enterocolitis following blood transfusions, the neonatologist wants to hold enteral nutrition for 24 hours after the last aliquot of packed red blood cells is received. BGJ will then begin receiving full PN. She still has her peripherally inserted central catheter in place, and peripheral venous access is initiated for the blood transfusion.
Procedures or diagnostic tests:
Laboratory panel and hemoglobin and hematocrit were drawn today to assess electrolytes and because of the requirement to track fraction of inspired oxygen on the ventilator.
Medication changes:
BGJ continues to receive caffeine for apnea of prematurity.
IV fluid changes:
BGJ is currently receiving supplemental parenteral nutrition in addition to breast milk. Refer to PN order to see current PN composition.

97,same,What follow-up laboratory test results might be important to obtain for the following morning?,q_and_a,,,,"The usefulness of repeating laboratory tests in BGJ could be hotly debated, given her limited blood volume and the most likely reason for her anemia being laboratory monitoring. Because the plan is to reinitiate MBM/DBM at 5 ml every 3 hours at 24 hours after her last blood transfusion and advance to the goal EN volume thereafter, the need for further laboratory monitoring may not be warranted. Given BGJ’s low sodium, the recommendation is to repeat a laboratory panel (sodium, potassium, chloride, carbon dioxide, BUN, SCr, glucose, and calcium) after she has been weaned off PN for ~36–48 hours. If she is unable to wean off PN in the next 4–5 days, earlier laboratory testing may be warranted. Monitoring laboratory values after being weaned from PN will give the team an idea of whether she truly needs additional enteral sodium supplementation to grow adequately while receiving breast milk. Another potential option to assess sodium status may be a spot urine sodium assessment. Although this has been shown to be accurate only in surgical patients with ileostomies, it is considered a noninvasive assessment of total body sodium. It is important to note that urine sodium values are inaccurate while receiving diuretics such as furosemide.",
98,"BBS is a Day of Life 2, 35-week gestational age neonate born prematurely via spontaneous vaginal delivery at 1625 yesterday. Apgar scores were 5 at one minute, 7 at five minutes, and 8 at ten minutes. He is currently on the ventilator under the radiant warmer. Gastroschisis was diagnosed in utero, and his bowel is currently in a silo. He had minimal urine output overnight, so he has received one 20 ml per kilogram bolus of 0.9 percent normal saline.
Pertinent Maternal History:
BBS was born to a 17-year-old girl, gravida 1, para 0. She reported taking cocaine early in pregnancy before she knew she was pregnant. She quit at 14 weeks gestational age, and her last toxicology screen was negative. Medications during pregnancy included prenatal vitamins. At her 19-week ultrasound, it was discovered that BBS had gastroschisis. The mother was admitted in preterm labor following premature spontaneous rupture of membranes. Prior to delivery, she received one dose of intramuscular betamethasone 12 milligrams and two grams of intravenous ampicillin.
Reason for Consult:
The consult was requested for PN because of a delay in receiving full enteral nutrition due to the patient’s gastroschisis. The gastroschisis is currently being managed with a silo in place.
Nutrition Problem:
The patient is unable to initiate full enteral nutrition to meet nutrition requirements.
Birth Weight: 2.115 kilograms (appropriate for gestational age based on the Fenton growth curve).
Length at Birth: 44 centimeters (appropriate for gestational age based on the Fenton growth curve).
Current Weight: 1.925 kilograms.
Weight Assessment: The patient has lost approximately 9 percent of birth weight on Day of Life 2.
Nutrition Goals:
PN alone fluid goal: 120 to 130 ml per kilogram per day.
With enteral nutrition fluid goal: 140 to 150 ml per kilogram per day.
Protein goal: 4 grams per kilogram per day.
Parenteral caloric goal: 100 to 110 kilocalories per kilogram per day.
Enteral caloric goal: 120 to 130 kilocalories per kilogram per day.
Diet: The patient is receiving nothing enterally. The mother does not plan to breastfeed.
IV Access: Peripheral venous access.
IV Fluids: D10W at 7 ml per hour.
Medications: Intravenous ampicillin 211.5 milligrams every 8 hours and intravenous gentamicin 10.6 milligrams every 24 hours.
Fluid Intake and Output Assessment at approximately 16.5 hours of life:
Intake: 161 ml total.
Oral: none.
OG or NG: none.
IV: 161 ml (consisting of 116 ml IV fluid and 45 ml normal saline bolus).
Output: 50 ml total.
Urine: 20 ml.
NG or G-tube: 20 ml.
Drains: 10 ml from gauze around the silo.
Ostomy: none.
Stool: none yet.
Abdomen: Unable to adequately assess because the bowel is in the silo.
