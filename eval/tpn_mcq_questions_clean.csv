1.0,In which of the following cases should PN be initiated?,"A. Term infant with gastroschisis | B. 1-month-old former 26-week preterm infant with abdominal distension and portal venous air on abdominal x-ray | C. 3-month-old former 26-week preterm infant with a chylothorax | D. 35-weeks’ gestational age (GA) preterm infant in septic shock secondary to group B Streptococcus (GBS) sepsis | E. Newborn preterm infant on a planned feeding advance of GI priming and ,30 mL/kg/day increase due to intermittent feeding intolerance | F. All of the above","A,B,C,D,E,F",,F is correct.,PN is indicated when full enteral nutrition cannot be achieved and may be particularly useful in catabolic conditions.,Practical Parenteral Nutrition Workbook chapter 6
2.0,Which intervention would be the LEAST likely next access attempt for a newborn infant who lost their peripheral line while receiving stock PN and trophic feeds?,A. Insert a new peripheral intravenous line (PIV) | B. Place a umbilical venous catheter (UVC) | C. Surgically place a catheter (Broviac or Hickman) | D. Place a percutaneous inserted central catheter (PICC),C,,C is correct.,"A new PIV should be attempted, especially because it is usually easy to insert a new PIV. However, it is only appropriate for short-term access. A UVC, the least painful and invasive central access, could be attempted in a newborn infant if the umbilical vein is patent. UVCs have increased infection risk after 1 to 2 weeks. If a UVC placement is unsuccessful and longer term access is sought, a PICC line would be the next option and is appropriate for longer term access. The last, and most invasive option, would be a surgically centrally placed (Broviac or Hickman) catheter. Although infection risk is low, it is highly invasive with placement and removal requiring a surgeon. Therefore it would only be considered once all other options are exhausted or it is known that an infant will require very long-term access. See Table 6.2 for additional differences in peripheral and central access.",Practical Parenteral Nutrition Workbook chapter 6
3.0,Which of the following statements regarding PN and enteral neonatal nutrition is FALSE?,"A. Normal fetal metabolic and growth rates and nutritional requirements stop with birth, precluding routine use of IV nutrition | B. The smaller and more preterm and less developed the infant, the less body stores (protein, fat, and glycogen) are available to provide nutrients for metabolic needs. | C. The metabolic—and thus the nutrient—requirements of the newborn are equal to or greater than those of the fetus of the same gestational age. | D. First-week protein and energy intakes are associated with improved 18-month developmental outcomes in preterm infants.",A,"A 750 g AGA preterm infant is born following a 26-week gestation by C-section due to preterm, premature rupture of membranes and incompetent cervix. The resuscitation is unremarkable and the infant is placed on CPAP 6 cm H2O at 35% Fio2 following surfactant administration in the delivery room. At 1 hr of age, the infant’s plasma glucose concentration is 36 mg/dL. A stock PN of 10% dextrose and 3% amino acids is being infused through the UVC. Antibiotics were ordered after blood cultures were obtained.",A is false and the correct answer.,"PN is important right after birth because normal fetal metabolic and growth rates and nutritional requirements do not stop with birth. Furthermore, the smaller and more preterm, the less body stores (protein, fat, and glycogen) are available to provide nutrients for metabolic needs. Intravenous feeding is always indicated when normal metabolic needs are not met by enteral feeding. Additionally, the metabolic and nutrient requirements of the newborn are equal to or greater than those of the fetus of the same gestational age. Thus the newborn infant should receive the same nutrition as the fetus of the same gestational age to maintain normal metabolism and growth. PN is particularly important to ensure full protein and energy supplies to maintain neuronal development. First week protein and energy intakes are associated with improved 18-month developmental outcomes in preterm infants, as well as greater adult lean body mass and higher resting energy expenditure.",Practical Parenteral Nutrition Workbook chapter 6
4.0,Which of the following statements regarding Stock PN and protein and glucose supply is TRUE?,"A. Stock PN solutions containing 10% dextrose and 3% amino acids can be stored in the neonatal pharmacy indefinitely. | B. At an infusion rate of 80 mL/kg/day, commonly formulated stock PN solutions provide adequate short-term dextrose and amino acid supplies. | C. There is no need to continue to measure the plasma glucose concentration as the infant is receiving IV dextrose. | D. There is no need to check electrolytes or calcium and phosphorous concentrations until the second or third day of life when enteral feeding is started.",B,"A 750 g AGA preterm infant is born following a 26-week gestation by C-section due to preterm, premature rupture of membranes and incompetent cervix. The resuscitation is unremarkable and the infant is placed on CPAP 6 cm H2O at 35% Fio2 following surfactant administration in the delivery room. At 1 hr of age, the infant’s plasma glucose concentration is 36 mg/dL. A stock PN of 10% dextrose and 3% amino acids is being infused through the UVC. Antibiotics were ordered after blood cultures were obtained.",B is correct.,"Stock PN solutions can be stored in the pharmacy for immediate use, but like all pharmaceuticals, they cannot be stored indefinitely. A common stock PN mixture is 10% dextrose and 3% amino acids. At 80 mL/kg/day, this solution would provide 5.5 mg/kg/min of glucose (see Table 6.3 for calculations), which is appropriate for most preterm neonates. Because individual infants vary in response to dextrose infusions, one should always monitor the infant’s glucose concentration frequently to ensure that normal values are maintained. This standard stock PN mixture will provide 2.4 g/kg/day of amino acids, still less than the 3.5–4 g/kg/day of amino acids that are needed in very preterm infants to restore in utero protein accretion and body growth (see Table 6.4). Stock PN solutions often are not supplemented with calcium and phosphorous salts, but both should be added to a customized PN within the 1st 24 to 48 hours. Plasma calcium and phosphorous as well as routine electrolytes should be measured within the 1st 24 hours as electrolyte disturbances are commonly observed after very preterm birth.",Practical Parenteral Nutrition Workbook chapter 6
5.0,How many nonprotein calories and how much protein are provided by this stock PN and will this be enough energy and protein to prevent protein breakdown in this infant?,A. 27 kcal/kg/day and 2.4 g/kg/day | B. 40 kcal/kg/day and 3 g/kg/day | C. 22 kcal/kg/day and 4 g/kg/day | D. 160 kcal/kg/day and 2 g/kg/day,A,A 28-week gestation infant is born weighing 1.1 kg. Stock PN with 10% dextrose and 3% amino acids is started upon delivery at 80 mL/kg/day.,A is the correct.,"10% dextrose has a dextrose concentration of 10 g/100 mL. At an infusion rate of 80 mL/kg/day, it provides 27 kcal/kg/day (80 ml/kg/day 3 10 g/dL ÷ 100 3 3.4 kcal/g of glucose 5 27 kcal/kg/day). 3% amino acids has an amino acid concentration of 3 g/100 mL. At an infusion rate of 80 mL/kg/day it provides 2.4 g/kg/day of amino acids. At least 1.5 g/kg/day of parenteral amino acids is necessary to prevent significant protein breakdown (catabolism). Thus while the energy from just the dextrose infusion may be insufficient to promote full utilization of the 2.4 g/kg/day of amino acids for net protein balance, it is sufficient, along with the amino acid infusion, to prevent protein breakdown.",Practical Parenteral Nutrition Workbook chapter 6
6.0,Which of the following statements about IV dextrose infusion is FALSE?,"A. IV dextrose infusion should provide 30% to 50% of total caloric intake if no enteral feeding is provided. | B. Excess IV dextrose infusion intake increases the incidence and severity of hyperglycemia. | C. Glucose intolerance and hyperglycemia does not occur at glucose infusion rates ,10 mg/kg/min. | D. The glucose utilization rate is 2 to 4 mg/kg/min in term infants and 4 to 6 mg/kg/min in very preterm infants.",C,A 28-week gestation infant is born weighing 1.1 kg. Stock PN with 10% dextrose and 3% amino acids is started upon delivery at 80 mL/kg/day.,C is false and the correct answer.,"The normal glucose utilization rate is 2 to 4 mg/kg/min in term infants and 4 to 6 mg/kg/min in very preterm infants. These rates provide 30% to 50% of total caloric intake if no enteral feeding is provided. IV dextrose above these rates is the principal cause of neonatal hyperglycemia, but other conditions contribute to this problem, making it common. Many of these infants also have stress-induced catecholamine, cortisol, and glucagon surges that suppress insulin secretion and promote glycogen breakdown and gluconeogenesis and reduce peripheral insulin and glucose sensitivity. Excessive dosing of IV lipids also aggravates hyperglycemia by providing competitive lipid carbon for oxidation and by producing cofactors in the liver from beta-oxidation of fatty acids that promote the regulatory enzymes in the gluconeogenic pathway. Most preterm infants and term infants continue to produce glucose from their liver at about 2 to 3 mg/kg/min. Furthermore, hepatic glucose production, even in preterm infants, is not easily suppressed by high glucose or insulin concentrations. If the parenteral dextrose infusion rate is .5 to 7 mg/kg/min, then total glucose utilization capacity will be exceeded, resulting in progressively increasing glucose concentrations. Increasing glucose infusion rate (GIR) above 8 to 10 mg/kg/min almost always contributes to hyperglycemia, which has many adverse consequences, including increased CO2 production, lipogenesis, and development of a fatty liver with inflammation and steatosis. Glucose intolerance can occur in preterm infants even at a GIR of 6 mg/kg/min or lower, especially when glucose is infused without amino acids. Coinfusion of amino acids can reduce glucose concentrations and the incidence of hyperglycemia, as amino acids increase insulin secretion and promote anabolism (protein synthesis and protein balance) that requires energy production from glucose oxidation. Absence of enteral nutrition also contributes to the pathogenesis of hyperglycemia by limiting production of gut incretins, which stimulate insulin secretion. Infants of extremely low birth weight (ELBW) are very susceptible to hyperglycemia, further aggravating the overall nutritional status of these fragile infants. Reducing the GIR by coinfusing a lower dextrose fluid, reducing total fluids overall, or advancing feeds are effective ways to normalize glucose levels.",Practical Parenteral Nutrition Workbook chapter 6
7.0,Which of the following statements about PN amino acid practice is TRUE?,"A. Starting with higher amino acid intakes of 3 g/kg/day administered in the first few days of life is safe and decreases the incidence of extrauterine growth restriction. | B. Current PN amino acid mixtures provide optimal amino acid supplies and plasma concentrations of all essential and nonessential amino acids for very preterm infants. | C. Providing more amino acids, even above requirements, will improve growth and neurodevelopmental outcomes. | D. Only 3% amino acid solutions should be used to prevent osmotic injury to blood vessels and red blood cells.",A,"A 28-week gestation infant is born weighing 1.1 kg. Stock PN with 10% dextrose and 3% amino acids is started upon delivery at 80 mL/kg/day. On day 2, customized PN is ordered; 10% dextrose is continued, but amino acids are increased to 4 g/kg/day and intravenous lipids are started at 2 g/kg/day.",A is correct.,"The energy provided should meet the basal metabolic rate plus the energy cost of growth and losses (gastrointestinal, urinary, skin, others). To achieve a growth rate of 15 to 20 g/kg/day, the preterm infant requires 110 to 130 kcal/kg/day enterally. When all nutrition is PN, 90 to 100 kcal/kg/day should meet the growth needs, because there is no energy spent for digestion and absorption, and fecal losses are minimal. Energy losses are minimized by the use of a controlled thermoneutral environment and fluid losses are ameliorated by the use of humidification (which are further reduced by humidification of inhaled air/oxygen gases with assisted ventilation). See Table 6.3 to calculate the caloric content of PN solutions.",Practical Parenteral Nutrition Workbook chapter 6
8.0,Which of the following statements about protein requirements in this newborn infant is CORRECT?,A. Preterm infants should receive 2 to 2.5 g/kg/day of protein when receiving PN. | B. Protein intakes of 4 to 4.5 g/kg/day are recommended for preterm infants with slow weight gain. | C. The protein requirements of preterm infants are greater than those of term infants. | D. Protein intakes .3.5 g/kg/day may result in high uric acid and creatinine levels.,C,"A 28-week gestation infant is born weighing 1.1 kg. Stock PN with 10% dextrose and 3% amino acids is started upon delivery at 80 mL/kg/day. On day 2, customized PN is ordered; 10% dextrose is continued, but amino acids are increased to 4 g/kg/day and intravenous lipids are started at 2 g/kg/day.",C is correct.,"Current pediatric amino acid solutions were initially formulated to meet the requirements of infants and children and provide a plasma amino acid profile similar to that of term 30-day-old breastfed infants. As such, they contain insufficient amounts of many amino acids, particularly essential and conditionally essential amino acids. It is fundamental that during fetal life, fractional growth rate and fractional protein synthetic rates, which determine amino acid requirements, decline with gestation. Fetal animal studies and the factorial method for assessing fetal protein requirements in human infants at 24 to 30 weeks’ gestation show that 3.6 to 4.8 g/kg/day of amino acids support the more rapid growth at these early gestational ages. The average value of 4 g/kg/day is recommended as the guideline for infants after birth but of the same gestational age as the rapidly growing normal human fetus. At later gestational ages, less protein (amino acids) is needed; for example, 2.5 to 3.5 g/kg/day between 30 to 36 weeks and 1.5 to 2 g/kg/day at term (which is the amount provided by full breast feeding of mature mother’s milk). These manufactured solutions contain essential amino acids and conditionally essential amino acids such as tyrosine and taurine. The delivery of gestational age–appropriate amounts of amino acids along with adequate energy results in positive nitrogen balance and a decrease in loss of body weight, thereby reducing time to regain birth weight. It is estimated that, in the absence of exogenous intake, endogenous protein losses are 0.5 to 1 g/kg/day for infants receiving only dextrose in the infusion. Protein should provide 8% to 10% of total calories; providing more than 10% of the gestational age–appropriate amount of protein is unnecessary and does not increase net protein accretion or body growth rate.",Practical Parenteral Nutrition Workbook chapter 6
9.0,Which of the following statements about PN amino acid practice is TRUE?,"A. Starting with higher amino acid intakes of 3 g/kg/day administered in the first few days of life is safe and decreases the incidence of extrauterine growth restriction. | B. Current PN amino acid mixtures provide optimal amino acid supplies and plasma concentrations of all essential and nonessential amino acids for very preterm infants. | C. Providing more amino acids, even above requirements, will improve growth and neurodevelopmental outcomes. | D. Only 3% amino acid solutions should be used to prevent osmotic injury to blood vessels and red blood cells.",A,"A 28-week gestation infant is born weighing 1.1 kg. Stock PN with 10% dextrose and 3% amino acids is started upon delivery at 80 mL/kg/day. On day 2, customized PN is ordered; 10% dextrose is continued, but amino acids are increased to 4 g/kg/day and intravenous lipids are started at 2 g/kg/day.",A is correct.,"Early introduction of amino acids in PN is safe, results in a positive nitrogen balance, and improves glucose tolerance, most likely by increasing insulin and IGF-1 secretion and enhancing protein synthesis that requires glucose for energy. More recent studies reveal that starting with higher amino acid intakes of 3 g/kg/day administered in the first few days of life is safe and decreases the incidence of extra uterine growth restriction. Answer B is incorrect, because current IV amino acid solutions were not developed to provide optimal individual amino acid delivery for newborn infants, including very preterm infants, infants with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), and especially infants with early postnatal physiologic and biochemical instability. Answer C is incorrect because the imbalance in plasma essential, conditionally essential, and nonessential amino acids provided in current neonatal IV amino acid solutions is not improved by simply increasing the IV amino acid intake (infusion) rate. Perhaps as a result of these limitations, there is only limited evidence that increased IV amino acid supply during the first days after birth improves growth or neurodevelopmental outcomes. Instead, neurodevelopment is improved when greater amounts of amino acids (and total protein when milk feedings are added) are given with higher amounts of energy, both carbohydrate and lipid. Maintaining the gestational age–appropriate protein intake supports brain growth as measured by head circumference and subsequent magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, even into adolescence. Commonly accepted recommendations for preterm infants are shown in Table 6.4, although there is considerable variability among NICUs in this practice. Intakes of amino acids higher than 4 g/kg/day right after birth have not been shown to further enhance protein balance, even in extremely preterm infants born between 23 and 28 weeks’ gestation who require the higher amino acid and protein intakes for optimal growth. Answer D is incorrect because up to 5% amino acid solutions can be infused slowly through central venous catheters when concentrating PN to avoid overhydration and hyperglycemia.",Practical Parenteral Nutrition Workbook chapter 6
10.0,Which of the following statements about IV lipid emulsions is FALSE?,"A. IV lipid emulsions must be started at 0.5 g/kg/day. | B. Excess IV lipids often produce hypertriglyceridemia, a sign of reduced plasma lipid clearance. | C. IV lipids produce carbon competition with glucose for oxidation, contributing to hyperglycemia. | D. Advancing IV lipids to 3 to 3.5 g/kg/day is important for providing nonprotein calories for achieving positive energy balance and supporting protein synthesis and net protein balance. | E. IV lipid emulsions do not contain sufficient amounts of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) to meet normal fetal accretion of this essential polyunsaturated fatty acid (LCPUFA).",A,"A 28-week gestation infant is born weighing 1.1 kg. Stock PN with 10% dextrose and 3% amino acids is started upon delivery at 80 mL/kg/day. On day 2, customized PN is ordered; 10% dextrose is continued, but amino acids are increased to 4 g/kg/day and intravenous lipids are started at 2 g/kg/day.",A is false and the correct answer.,"IV lipid emulsions can be started at higher rates, up to 2.5 to 3.5 g/kg/day, but the most common practice is to start at about 1 to 2 g/kg/day and advance by 0.5 to 2 g/kg/day (slower rates for smaller, more preterm infants, faster rates for larger, less preterm infants) each day up to 3 to 3.5 g/kg/day. Answer B is true, as many preterm infants—especially those born extremely preterm and of extremely low birth weight—have limited lipoprotein lipase activity (and other lipases), limiting their capacity for plasma lipid clearance. Although many use an upper limit of 200 to 250 mg/dL for serum triglyceride concentrations, there is no specific pathology associated with high levels of triglycerides, and they only indirectly indicate that oxidative metabolism of fatty acids released by lipases from triglycerides might be limited. Answer C is true because IV lipids can release sufficient amounts of fatty acids that produce carbon competition with glucose for mitochondrial oxidation, contributing to hyperglycemia. Similarly, hyperglycemia from excess IV dextrose infusion rates and other processes limit fatty acid carbon oxidation and their beneficial effect on energy balance. IV lipid emulsions do not, however, contain carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT), the enzyme necessary for transporting long chain fatty acids into mitochondria for oxidation. Milk and preterm formulas do contain reasonable amounts of CPT, indicating that IV nutrition with lipids requires some enteral feeding to allow sufficient fatty acid oxidation for achieving positive energy balance. Answer D is true because advancing IV lipids to 3 to 3.5 g/kg/day is important for providing nonprotein calories, for achieving positive energy balance, and supporting protein synthesis and net protein balance. Answer E is true. IV lipid emulsions do not contain sufficient amounts of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) to meet normal fetal accretion of this essential polyunsaturated fatty acid (LCPUFA). Even fish oil–based IV lipid emulsions, which do contain some DHA, do not contain enough DHA to produce normal fetal DHA deposition rates. Fetal white adipose tissue accumulation during last trimester of n-3 fatty acid is about 45 to 65 mg/day (mostly as 22:6n-3, or DHA). A 1 kg preterm infant fed human milk containing 3.7 g fat/dL with 0.2% to 0.4% fatty acids as 22:6n-3 (DHA) at an enteral feeding volume of 180 mL/kg/day would receive only 13 to 25 mg 22:6n-3 DHA/day, clearly below normal in utero accretion rates. Preterm infants fed increased 22:6n-3 DHA may have higher visual acuity, particularly at 2 and 4 months, and improved Bayley mental development and MacArthur Communicative inventories at 12 months, but longer term studies have not shown a clear benefit to any aspect of neurodevelopment of supplemental DHA. Thus the current diet for preterm infants is deficient in this essential fatty acid, but the long-term significance of this deficiency is not known, nor is how these infants would develop if fed to sufficiency.",Practical Parenteral Nutrition Workbook chapter 6
11.0,Which of the following is correct?,"A. The amino acid/dextrose/lipid infusion amounts should be decreased in amounts equivalent to the advanced enteral feeding nutrient amounts. | B. PN infusion rates plus enteral feeding volumes should be adjusted to maintain 4 g/kg/day protein intake, plasma glucose concentrations between 54 and 106 mg/dL (3–6 mmol/L), and plasma triglyceride concentrations <250 mg/dL. | C. The amino acid infusion rate should be decreased to 2 g/kg/day to avoid uremia (elevated blood urea nitrogen [BUN]), hyperammonemia, toxic amino acid concentrations, and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. | D. Total energy intake should be increased to 120 or more kcal/kg/day to meet the protein intake of 4 g/kg/day, using the ratio of 30 kcal per g protein for all protein intake rates.",B,"A 29-week gestation infant is on 6 cm H2O CPAP with 30% Fio2 and is breathing 50 to 60 breaths per minute without signs of respiratory distress. The infant is on stock PN, with a new custom PN providing 4 g/kg/day of amino acids, 10% dextrose, and lipids at 2 g/kg/day ordered for this evening. Enteral feedings are started with unsupplemented donor milk at 20 mL/kg/day with a plan to advance by 30 mL/kg/day after 3 days of trophic feeds.",B is correct.,"It is important to maintain the necessary protein and energy intakes required for growth as PN is reduced and enteral feedings are advanced. Maintaining sufficient protein and energy intake and meeting the needs for metabolism and growth are essential, but individual nutrients should be adjusted to ensure normal plasma nutrient and metabolic product concentrations. Answer A is incorrect, because this will lead to under nutrition as donor milk does not have sufficient protein to maintain normal protein balance and promote growth if IV amino acid infusion rates are decreased too quickly. Not uncommonly, PN is often reduced abruptly to allow for removal of central lines or because of poor peripheral IV access. However, this can produce a period of several days when there is inadequate protein and energy intake. Answer C is incorrect. Some clinicians have raised concerns about the adverse effects of higher early amino acid infusion rates on neurodevelopment because of the possibility of causing hyperaminoacidemia, metabolic acidosis, uremia, and hyperammonemia, but most studies have not shown such adverse outcomes. In fact, BUN concentrations and ammonia concentrations should both increase slightly with increased amino acid infusion rates if the amino acids are appropriately oxidized and producing ammonia and the liver is functioning well to remove ammonia through the urea cycle. There is little correlation between plasma BUN and ammonia concentrations and amino acid infusion rates in the acceptable range. Abnormally high amino acid concentrations generally are the result of excessive and unnecessary infusion rates (>4 g/kg/day) and limited urinary urea excretion. Caution should be used in giving high amino acid infusion rates to infants with impaired liver or renal function from hypoxic-ischemic injury that prevents ammonia detoxification by the damaged liver and urea and ammonia excretion by the damaged kidney. In contrast, the most common metabolic complication of IV amino acid solutions is lower than needed plasma concentrations of essential and some conditionally essential amino acids, as well as unbalanced amino acid concentrations, which together will limit anabolism and net protein balance. Furthermore, there are many examples of improved morbidities with optimal amino acid infusion rates. For example, a lower incidence of chronic lung disease has been reported in infants receiving higher intakes (4 g/kg/day) than in those receiving 3 g/kg/day, but whether this is due to improved lung growth directly from the amino acids or from amino acid production of IGF-1 is uncertain. Answer D is incorrect, because the protein-to-energy ratio is curvilinear; that is, there is not a fixed protein-to-energy ratio across the range of metabolizable, nonprotein energy intakes. It should be underscored that nitrogen retention increases with increasing energy intake up to about 80 to 90 kcal/kg/day, but at higher energy (caloric) intakes, there is no increased gain in net protein balance. The latter is achieved only with greater protein intakes. At low energy intakes, more energy improves protein balance, but greater amounts of energy, from both carbohydrate and lipid, above the amount needed for protein balance only contribute to greater fat accretion (see Table 6.3).",Practical Parenteral Nutrition Workbook chapter 6
12.0,Which of the following is TRUE?,A. Amino acid concentrations in standard IV amino acid solutions are balanced toward nonessential amino acids. | B. IV glutamine is required to promote protein balance and reduce infections. | C. Cysteine may be added to daily PN mixtures because it is a conditionally essential amino acid in extremely preterm infants that may be important during rapid growth periods. | D. Carnitine should be added to all PN solutions starting on day 1 and continued as long as the infant is receiving PN regardless of enteral feeding advancements of milk or formula.,C,"A 29-week gestation infant is on 6 cm H2O CPAP with 30% Fio2 and is breathing 50 to 60 breaths per minute without signs of respiratory distress. The infant is on stock PN, with a new custom PN providing 4 g/kg/day of amino acids, 10% dextrose, and lipids at 2 g/kg/day ordered for this evening. Enteral feedings are started with unsupplemented donor milk at 20 mL/kg/day with a plan to advance by 30 mL/kg/day after 3 days of trophic feeds.",C is correct.,"Cysteine may be considered an essential amino acid in preterm infants, especially in infants less than 33 to 34 weeks’ gestation, particularly during rapid growth. Cysteine is important for protein accretion and is added as cysteine hydrochloride 40 mg/g amino acid (not to exceed 100 mg/kg/day). Because the cysteine is added as a hydrochloride acid, it will lower the pH of the infusate and increase solubility of calcium and phosphorous. Cysteine is added at the time of compounding due to stability issues. Answer A is incorrect because the ideal PN solution for preterm infants is unknown. Currently, three formulations are available in the United States, and data to date do not allow firm conclusions of superiority of one over the other. Pediatric formulations used for preterm and term neonates contain higher concentrations of branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, valine) and decreased amounts of methionine and phenylalanine due to their potential toxicity at very high concentrations (not seen with current solutions infused at customary rates). Neonates have additional amino acids that are considered conditionally essential (tyrosine, glutamine, arginine, cysteine, glycine, proline, and perhaps citrulline), but many of these are not provided in sufficient amounts to maintain overall normal metabolic, protein balance, and growth rates. Tyrosine is not present in these solutions but may be added as N-acetyl tyrosine, although there is no proven advantage to growth or metabolic conditions with this form of tyrosine. Answer B is incorrect. Glutamine, the most abundant amino acid in plasma and human milk, is not included in PN solutions because of decreased solubility. However, supplementation of glutamine in preterm infants has not been shown to improve mortality, rates of sepsis, or length of NICU stay. Therefore IV glutamine supplementation is not currently recommended; rather, it is provided with enteral feeding of milk or formula. Answer D is incorrect. Carnitine is another essential amino acid not included in available neonatal IV amino acid solutions. It is provided in human milk and has been added to preterm formulas. It is important for transport of long chain fatty acids across the inner mitochondrial membrane in all cells, making fatty acids available for energy production. Plasma levels decline without dietary supplementation. It is an accepted additive for long term PN (>2 weeks) when it does appear to increase hepatic cytosolic beta oxidation of long chain fatty acids. However, there is no evidence that even with this cytosolic oxidation there is improved energy balance or protein accretion.",Practical Parenteral Nutrition Workbook chapter 6
13.0,Which of the following statements about lipid emulsions is TRUE?,"A. Exclusive soybean oil IV lipid emulsions contain all of the required fatty acids, antiinflammatory products, and lack inflammatory substances such as phytosterols. | B. Phytosterols are important for lipid solubility and thus should be added to all IV lipid emulsions. | C. Fish oil (exclusive or partial) IV lipid emulsions have a higher n-3/n-6 ratio, which may have antiinflammatory properties that reduce parenteral nutrition–associated cholestatic liver disease (PNALD) and contribute to improved developmental outcomes. | D. Use of IV lipid emulsions with mixtures of oils has been proven to improve outcomes.",C,"A 29-week gestation infant is on 6 cm H2O CPAP with 30% Fio2 and is breathing 50 to 60 breaths per minute without signs of respiratory distress.

Enteral feedings are started with unsupplemented donor milk at 20 mL/kg/day with a plan to advance by 30 mL/kg/day after 3 days of trophic feeds.",C is correct.,"Exclusive fish oil–based lipid emulsions provide DHA, relatively large amounts of alpha-tocopherol, and no phytosterols (Table 6.5). An exclusive fish oil product (Omegaven®) is available in the United States under compassionate-use and research protocols only. It usually is given in combination with other lipid emulsions to provide a more balanced mix of fatty acids. n-3 fatty acids or very long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (VLCPUFA) such as DHA have beneficial effects on the developing brain and retina and may be considered conditionally essential in preterm infants. Studies have demonstrated that the use of the fish oil emulsion can reverse or at least ameliorate hepatic dysfunction in infants and children with PNALD, but the quantity of fish oil emulsion required has not been determined, and variation in response among large numbers of subjects remains untested. Answer A is incorrect. Lipid emulsions, derived mainly from soybean and safflower oil, contain neutral triglycerides, glycerol, and phospholipids for emulsification. The most commonly used emulsion in the United States is soybean oil derived. It has no DHA and little alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E, as an antiinflammatory substance), and it contains medium chain fatty acids and large amounts of phytosterols. Answer B is incorrect. Phytosterols have been associated with Kupffer cell activation and inflammation, leading to hepatic injury and cirrhosis. Their elimination from nonsoybean oil IV lipid emulsions may be as or more important in preventing or ameliorating PNALD than the benefits assumed for fish oil and other short (oleic) and long chain polyunsaturated essential fatty acids (specifically, DHA) or antiinflammatory substances such as alpha-tocopherol. Answer D is incorrect. It is weighted to linoleic n-6 long chain fatty acids, producing a higher n-6/n-3 fatty acid ratio. Mixed soybean, olive, and fish oil–based emulsions containing medium chain fatty acids, alpha-tocopherol, significant amounts of DHA, and decreased amounts of n-6 PUFAs are available in Europe, and one has recently been introduced in the United States (Smoflipid®). It does contain phytosterols but in amounts much lower than the exclusive soybean oil product. To date there is no consistent evidence that the mixed-oil emulsions improve specific outcomes, particularly as the amount and duration of IV lipid emulsion use is diminishing with earlier and faster advancement of enteral feeding of milk.",Practical Parenteral Nutrition Workbook chapter 6

Sodium is not needed during the first few days of life. All infants are born with an expanded extracellular fluid space and increased total body sodium content. The postnatal diuresis is responsible for removing fluid and ridding the body of excess sodium. A delayed diuresis or provision of maintenance sodium in the first few days of life has been associated with an increased risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Furthermore, most ill or physiologically unstable preterm infants receive significant amounts of sodium in arterial line solutions and drugs such as ampicillin and heparin. Potassium should be added to the PN after the diuresis has been established. Many NICUs add calcium to the first PN solutions, although there is limited rational evidence for this practice other than perhaps to preserve myocardial contractility. The risk of adding calcium without phosphorus is significant, however, as calcium supplement alone increases the risk of hypophosphatemia.",Practical Parenteral Nutrition Workbook chapter 6

IV calcium and phosphorus should be started soon after birth with an optimal Ca/P ratio of 1:1 molar, 1.3–1.7:1 mg/mg, and 1–1.3:1 mEq/mEq. This case order is appropriate. Solubility depends on temp, amino acid conc., glucose conc., pH, sequence, ratio, and lipid presence. Adding cysteine lowers pH and improves solubility. Ionized calcium should be measured, especially in hypoxic/ischemic conditions. PN supplementation provides ~60–70% of intrauterine needs.

Therefore the PN rate will be 4.5 – 1.5 = 3 mL/hr. If the PN was ordered at the total fluid rate, as is still a common practice, the infant would have received 67% of the desired nutrient delivery. In this scenario, the PN would have delivered 2.7 g/kg/day of amino acids compared with 4 g/kg/day when concentrated. Nutrition delivery can be greatly improved by concentrating PN. However, care must be taken to avoid providing excessive nutrients when combined with advancing enteral nutrition. There are also limitations to what can be compounded into small PN volumes. Additionally, a plan must be in place for unexpected cessation of feeds so that concentrated PN rate is not inappropriately increased above the ordered rate.

Answer A is incorrect because no protein is given. Answer B is incorrect because it provides a GIR of 3.5 mg/kg/min, which is low and may contribute to hypoglycemia; additionally, the amino acid dose (4 g/kg/day) is excessive for day 1.

This can be achieved by manipulating infusion rates and/or dextrose concentrations to lower the GIR by 1 to 2 mg/kg/min. Advancing enteral feedings will promote production of incretins from the gut which increase insulin production. Answer A is incorrect because lowering to 3% dextrose decreases GIR to <4 mg/kg/min and risks hemolysis due to hypotonicity. Answer B is incorrect because increasing amino acids may help insulin secretion but will not lower glucose quickly. Answer C is incorrect because excess IV lipid promotes hepatic glucose production and competes with glucose oxidation, worsening hyperglycemia.

Smoflipid® is preferable over soybean-only lipids, as it reduces hepatic injury risk due to its balanced mix (fish oil DHA, olive oil, MCTs). B (surgical reanastomosis) might eventually help but is not the immediate step. Ursodiol requires enteral delivery and is not usable while NPO.

Premature infants who receive mother’s own milk demonstrate improved developmental outcomes compared with formula-fed premature infants.","A,B,C,C","The attending obstetrician requests an antenatal consult for a 26-year-old primigravida presenting at 24 weeks with premature labor, rupture of membranes, and imminent delivery.",All of the above statements are true.,"The use of mother’s own milk should be encouraged for all premature infants, as affirmed by the American Academy of Pediatrics and ESPGHAN. Preterm milk contains higher levels of immune factors (secretory IgA, lysozyme, lactoferrin, interferon) and promotes colonization with beneficial organisms. Outcomes include reduced sepsis, NEC, BPD, rehospitalization, and improved neurodevelopmental outcomes (at 18–22 months, 30 months, and even 7 years). The benefits are dose-dependent, with >50% breast milk exposure in the first month correlating with better brain and cognitive development. Mothers are more likely to provide milk when well-informed, and NICUs should support milk expression and quality improvement initiatives to increase human milk use.",Practical Parenteral Nutrition Workbook chapter 8
67.0,Which of the following statements are true based on currently available evidence?,"A. Donor milk is pasteurized to minimize risk of infection.
B. Pasteurization preserves all immunologic benefits of human milk.
C. The nutrient composition of banked donor milk is comparable to preterm human milk.
D.Premature infants who receive donor milk demonstrate similar rates of weight gain as those who are fed premature formula.",A,A neonatal nurse practitioner asks about the use of banked donor human milk if the mother cannot provide enough milk for her premature infant.,A is the correct option,"Pasteurized donor milk is recommended if mother’s own milk is unavailable. Donors are screened and milk is pasteurized to minimize infection risk. However, donor milk (often from term mothers) has lower protein content than preterm milk. Pooling (3–5 donors) reduces variability, sometimes adjusted for caloric/protein targets. Studies show protein often <1 g/dL and energy <15 kcal/oz. Pasteurization reduces beneficial bioactive components (macrophages, neutrophils, secretory IgA, lactoferrin, lysozyme) though fatty acids remain stable, with DHA/ARA levels lower than maternal milk. HMOs are preserved, but their clinical impact remains uncertain. Donor milk protects against NEC, but weight gain is slower compared to formula-fed infants. Future research should optimize pasteurization and pooling for nutrient and bioactive preservation.",Practical Parenteral Nutrition Workbook chapter 9
68.0,"A 710 g female, born at 24 weeks GA, mother expressing milk every 3 hours with ~9 oz/day by day 5.","A. The protein content is lower now than it will be after 4 weeks of lactation.
B. Milk expressed at 2 weeks is sufficient to meet all nutrient requirements of this infant.
C. Expressed milk has higher content of calcium and phosphorus than preterm formula.",None,"A 710 g female, born at 24 weeks GA, mother expressing milk every 3 hours with ~9 oz/day by day 5.",All are incorrect,"Preterm human milk initially has higher protein content (1.4–1.6 g/dL) in the first 2 weeks, but it declines over time to ~1.0 g/dL (similar to term milk). Despite being richer than term milk in some nutrients, preterm milk alone does not meet the full nutrient needs of extremely premature infants and must be fortified. During transition to full enteral feeds, parenteral nutrition is needed to meet intake goals. Calcium and phosphorus are also lower than in preterm formula.",Practical Parenteral Nutrition Workbook chapter 10
69.0,Which of the following statements regarding premature infant formulas are true?,"A. Like human milk, lactose is the exclusive source of carbohydrate in premature formulas.
B. In contrast to formulas designed for term infants, premature formulas supply 40% to 50% of the total lipid content as medium chain triglycerides.
C. The protein composition of premature formulas is predominantly casein based.
D. The protein content of premature formula is similar to fortified human milk.
E. The calcium and phosphorus content of premature formulas is lower than that of term formula","B,D","Former 29-week gestation female, birth weight 1250 g, now 3 weeks old. Mother’s milk supply inadequate despite lactation support; mother does not consent to donor milk. Medical student asks about types of formulas available for premature infants.",Options B and D are True.,"Preterm formulas contain 40–50% lactose + 50–60% glucose polymers, unlike human milk where lactose is exclusive. This helps due to low lactase in preterms, while alpha-glucosidase enzymes are abundant. Lipid composition includes 40–50% MCTs to aid fat absorption and supplemented DHA/ARA. Protein content is higher than term formula (3.3–3.6 g/100 kcal) and whey-predominant (not casein based), patterned after human milk. Calcium and phosphorus content is higher than term formula, not lower. Soy-based formulas are avoided due to low phosphorus, risk of metabolic bone disease, and phytates reducing iron absorption.",Practical Parenteral Nutrition Workbook chapter 11

Focus: SGA prevalence and postnatal growth failure risk factors.,All are correct.,"Risk of postnatal growth failure is inversely related to BW and GA. Neonatal factors include: prolonged ventilation, postnatal steroids, severe IVH/PVL, and NEC. Morbidities such as NEC impair both nutrient provision and utilization, worsening growth velocity.",Practical Parenteral Nutrition Workbook chapter 13
72.0,Which formula would be most appropriate at discharge for this infant?,"A. Standard term formula (20 kcal/oz)

Transitional/postdischarge premature formula (22 kcal/oz)","A,D",Preterm infant approaching discharge; evaluation of formula choice.,Either A or B depending on growth and weight-for-PMA.,Evidence is mixed. A Cochrane Review found no consistent benefit of postdischarge formulas. Continued preterm formula may sometimes achieve better growth. Transitional (22 kcal/oz) may help infants with growth restriction (<10th percentile at discharge). Infants ≥10th percentile but needing extra calories can use concentrated standard formula. Choice should be individualized.,Practical Parenteral Nutrition Workbook chapter 14
